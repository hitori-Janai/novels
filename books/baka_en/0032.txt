Chapter 32: Target, Liu Xin! [[2500 旁白 neutral]]
[You were crushed to death by the Peak Master of Sky Mending Peak with a single finger.] [[2501 旁白 neutral]]
[Current remaining pages in The Hundred Lives Book: 95] [[2502 旁白 neutral]]
[Starting a new life, you can choose one of the following rewards from your previous life:] [[2503 旁白 neutral]]
One: Treasures. [[2504 旁白 neutral]]
Two: Cultivation. [[2505 旁白 neutral]]
Three: Lifespan. [[2506 旁白 neutral]]
Four: Forfeit all rewards and awaken a random talent based on your previous life's experience.] [[2507 旁白 neutral]]
"Those whose names are called, come before me." [[2508 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin's voice came from the stage, but Lv Yang remained dazed for a long time, his mind still lingering on the furious sword strike from his past life. [[2509 旁白 neutral]]
"An ant trying to shake a great tree... That's not wrong." [[2510 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang let out a long breath. Although he had witnessed the gap between himself and a Foundation Establishment Master, he was not discouraged. Instead, his fighting spirit grew stronger. [[2511 旁白 neutral]]
With The Hundred Lives Book, whatever doesn't kill him will only make him stronger. [[2512 旁白 neutral]]
It's just a matter of starting over. [[2513 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang looked at the interface of The Hundred Lives Book again. In his previous life, he had focused solely on bitter cultivation and had nothing to show for it except for reaching the sixth level of Qi Refining. [[2514 旁白 neutral]]
However, he could not choose cultivation. [[2515 旁白 neutral]]
After all, as long as the hidden danger of the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art" remained, he could not practice this technique, or it would be like carrying a ticking time bomb. [[2516 旁白 neutral]]
"I choose talent." [[2517 吕阳 neutral]]
[Calculating your experiences from the previous life...] [[2518 旁白 neutral]]
[After your death, the story of how you drew your sword to strike a Foundation Establishment Master spread. Countless people mocked you for overestimating your abilities, but they did not know that your efforts were not entirely in vain.] [[2519 旁白 neutral]]
[Although you still failed to harm the Foundation Establishment Master in the slightest, at the very moment you were about to be crushed, you miraculously broke through a bottleneck in your swordsmanship. This forced the Sky Mending Peak Master to use a bit more strength to kill you. Afterwards, he remarked that although you were just an ant, you had a few tricks up your sleeve.] [[2520 旁白 neutral]]
[You have awakened the purple talent: A Few Tricks.] [[2521 旁白 neutral]]
[A Few Tricks: No matter how terrifying the attack, as long as it is within the limits of your ability, you can handle it with ease for two exchanges.] [[2522 旁白 neutral]]
"What kind of talent is this?" [[2523 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang frowned. At first glance, it seemed like a divine skill of absolute defense, but the "within the limits of your ability" in the description made it less impressive. [[2524 旁白 neutral]]
But he quickly stopped worrying about it. After all, he had chosen the talent only to avoid the hidden danger of practicing the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art" from his past life. A strong talent would be great, but a weak one didn't matter. More importantly, Lv Yang was concerned about finding a way to avoid the Sky Mending Peak Master's divination. [[2525 旁白 neutral]]
"If it really doesn't work, I'll have to give up on the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art'." [[2526 吕阳 neutral]]
"Lv Yang." [[2527 刘信 neutral]]
"...Here!" [[2528 吕阳 surprised]]
Liu Xin's voice from the stage brought Lv Yang back to his senses. He hurried onto the high platform, and just as in his previous lives, Liu Xin assigned him to the Joyful Union Hall. [[2529 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, Lv Yang was suddenly stunned. [[2530 旁白 surprised]]
"Wait a minute... I remember that Liu Xin refined a powerful figure into my Myriad Spirits Banner. It was very likely a true disciple of the Chu Sheng Sect." [[2531 吕阳 surprised]]
"Something is not right." [[2532 吕阳 surprised]]
I just practiced one technique and the Sky Mending Peak Master traced me through karma and came knocking. But Liu Xin killed a true disciple! [[2533 旁白 surprised]]
"How is he still alive?" [[2534 吕阳 surprised]]
At this thought, Lv Yang's eyes suddenly lit up, and he stared intently at Liu Xin on the stage. [[2535 旁白 neutral]]
"That's it! The only explanation is that he has a wondrous treasure that can obscure karma, making it impossible for a Foundation Establishment Master to divine any information about him!" [[2536 吕阳 surprised]]
In an instant, Lv Yang's mind raced with possibilities. He immediately changed his plan and replicated his actions from his first life, directly killing Yu Suzhen in public and successfully attracting Liu Xin's attention. [[2537 旁白 neutral]]
He obtained half of the Innate Dao Scripture from Liu Xin. [[2538 旁白 neutral]]
He went into closed-door cultivation. [[2539 旁白 neutral]]
Then, just as he expected, on a dark and windy night, a well-prepared Liu Xin came to the entrance of his cave residence, humming a little tune. [[2540 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv, are you there?" [[2541 刘信 neutral]]
Lv Yang did not speak. [[2542 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Liu Xin was not surprised. Instead, a cold smile appeared on his face. He patiently opened his storage bag and took out formation flags, setting them up in the surroundings. [[2543 旁白 neutral]]
These were formations used for soundproofing and creating illusions, ensuring that no matter what happened inside, no trace would be detected outside. Liu Xin had done similar things many times, and no one had ever connected them to him. Even if someone were to use karmic divination... [[2544 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Liu Xin touched the pocket inside his robe and smiled confidently. [[2545 旁白 neutral]]
Even if someone used karmic divination, it would be useless! [[2546 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, once the formation was set up, Liu Xin no longer hid his intentions. He unleashed his true qi and split open Lv Yang's cave residence with his sword, then strolled inside. [[2547 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv, stop hiding. A talent like you is exactly what I need... !?" [[2548 刘信 surprised]]
Liu Xin's voice stopped abruptly. [[2549 旁白 surprised]]
Inside the cave residence, Lv Yang was sitting on a cushion, looking at him with a faint smile, not at all like someone who should have cultivated a partial Innate Dao Scripture! [[2550 旁白 neutral]]
"...Something's wrong!" [[2551 刘信 fearful]]
In an instant, Liu Xin's pupils shrank, and a banner had already appeared in his hand. [[2552 旁白 neutral]]
But it was too late. [[2553 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, a red light flashed. Liu Xin felt most of his true qi and flesh-and-blood essence being instantly drained, and he stumbled and fell to the ground! [[2554 旁白 neutral]]
The Bloodbath Sky River Sword Formation Diagram! [[2555 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang had set up the formation diagram at the entrance of his cave long ago. By forcing his way in, Liu Xin had walked right into a trap and was easily captured. [[2556 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, I have been waiting for you for a long time." [[2557 吕阳 angry]]
Looking at the fallen Liu Xin, Lv Yang recalled how he had been tricked and killed by him in his first life. A cold sneer appeared on his face. You have finally fallen into my hands! [[2558 旁白 angry]]
If we switched places, I would show you what cruelty is! [[2559 旁白 angry]]
"Who are you!?" [[2560 刘信 fearful]]
Liu Xin lay paralyzed on the ground, unable to muster any strength. He couldn't understand what was happening. He had been tricked? By a new disciple who had just joined? [[2561 旁白 fearful]]
Impossible! Absolutely impossible! [[2562 旁白 fearful]]
"Are you a spy from a righteous sect? Wait, don't kill me, I can be useful to you... I have a superior Dao scripture that can help you reach Foundation Establishment!" [[2563 刘信 fearful]]
At this critical moment, Liu Xin threw caution to the wind and revealed his biggest secret. [[2564 旁白 neutral]]
"I also have a magic treasure. Inside it is a true disciple of the Chu Sheng Sect. He knows many secrets of the... no, the Chu Sheng Demonic Sect." [[2565 刘信 fearful]]
"If you let me go, all of this will be yours..." [[2566 刘信 fearful]]
Before Liu Xin could finish, Lv Yang activated the Blood-Transforming Divine Light, completely sucking him dry until only a human skin remained. "Fool. If I kill you, it's all mine anyway!" [[2567 吕阳 angry]]
"Even you are mine!" [[2568 吕阳 angry]]
Then, Lv Yang reached out and grabbed the Innate Qi Myriad Spirits Banner. He shook the banner and swept it over Liu Xin's body. [[2569 旁白 neutral]]
In a previous life, he had read the Innate Dao Scripture, so he naturally knew how to activate this treasure. [[2570 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin's body fell into the banner and immediately evaporated into qi. It circulated within the banner for a long time before Lv Yang shook it again, making the body reappear. [[2571 旁白 neutral]]
However, the reappeared Liu Xin had become a banner spirit of the Myriad Spirits Banner. Lv Yang had deliberately preserved his memories, so when Liu Xin revived, he looked at Lv Yang in disbelief. "Junior Brother Lv... impossible! How could you know how to activate the Myriad Spirits Banner?" [[2572 刘信 surprised]]
"What did you call me?" [[2573 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang sneered. "Do I need to teach you how a banner spirit should address its master? Or do you wish for your soul to be scattered?" [[2574 吕阳 angry]]
"My lord, spare me! Liu Xin pays his respects to the master!" [[2575 刘信 fearful]]
Liu Xin's knees instantly went weak, and he knelt on the ground. Although he had all his memories from before his death, he couldn't feel any hatred toward Lv Yang, who had killed him with his own hands. [[2576 旁白 neutral]]
In every thought, there was only absolute loyalty. [[2577 旁白 neutral]]
This was the tyrannical power of the Myriad Spirits Banner. At first glance, the banner spirits seemed no different from living people, but in reality, their minds had long been seized, and they had lost their true autonomy. [[2578 旁白 neutral]]
