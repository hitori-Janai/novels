Chapter 18: The Correct Way to Use a Cheat [[1447 旁白 neutral]]
"A predecessor's cave residence?" [[1448 吕阳 neutral]]
After hearing Zhao Xuhe's proposal, Lv Yang shook his head. "Thank you for the kind invitation, Senior Brother, but my skills are poor. For now, I just want to focus on my training." [[1449 吕阳 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe narrowed his eyes. "Oh? Junior Brother, is it that you don't trust me?" [[1450 赵旭河 angry]]
"You're overthinking it, Senior Brother. I haven't learned any combat techniques yet, so I would only hold you back if I went with you." [[1451 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's reason was perfectly logical. [[1452 旁白 neutral]]
After all, not long after joining the sect, he had started speculating on the Death-Substitution Yin Puppets and had even mortgaged his loan for techniques from the Library Pavilion. Zhao Xuhe knew this. [[1453 旁白 neutral]]
"...Then forget it." [[1454 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe shook his head, his expression turning cold. [[1455 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, killing intent rose in his heart. After all, he had lost everything, down to his last pair of pants, while Lv Yang had managed to make a profit and exit early. [[1456 旁白 neutral]]
How could he accept that? [[1457 旁白 neutral]]
More importantly, the contribution points Lv Yang earned were from a principal borrowed from him. Basically, that money should have been his! [[1458 旁白 neutral]]
"Fine, I'll let you hold onto it for now." [[1459 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe sneered inwardly. "He only knows how to cultivate and doesn't learn combat techniques. Does he think he's in some righteous sect where he can train in peace? Once I'm done with Panlong Island, I'll find a chance to sneak into his cave residence at night and kill him. Those contribution points will be mine anyway!" [[1460 赵旭河 angry]]
"If nothing unexpected happens, that guy Zhao is probably already thinking about how to deal with me." [[1461 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving Zhao Xuhe's cave residence, Lv Yang walked confidently towards the Library Pavilion, having already guessed Zhao Xuhe's thoughts without the slightest worry. [[1462 旁白 neutral]]
After all, he had not been idle these past few days. [[1463 旁白 neutral]]
While others were frantically speculating on the Death-Substitution Yin Puppets, he paid no attention to the outside world. He bought a large number of spiritual pills and went directly into seclusion to cultivate. [[1464 旁白 neutral]]
The fourth to sixth levels of Qi Refining were considered the middle stage, with no bottlenecks. Breakthroughs could be achieved simply by spending money on pills. [[1465 旁白 neutral]]
Having made a huge profit of ten thousand contribution points, Lv Yang was certainly not stingy. He had already broken through to the sixth level of Qi Refining, reaching the peak of the middle stage. [[1466 旁白 neutral]]
Incidentally, he had also used contribution points to exchange for a Cleansing Pill to cure the venereal disease his original body had. [[1467 旁白 neutral]]
This proved that the most incurable disease in life is poverty. [[1468 旁白 neutral]]
The reason Yu Suzhen died from her venereal disease in the first life was, in the end, due to a lack of money. [[1469 旁白 neutral]]
As for the bottleneck to the late stage, he had wanted to try breaking through with the Innate True Qi, but perhaps because the amount was insufficient, the effect was negligible. [[1470 旁白 neutral]]
This showed that he was probably not the only one who had been tricked by Liu Xin back then. [[1471 旁白 neutral]]
As for not learning any techniques, that was naturally just a lie to deceive Zhao Xuhe. [[1472 旁白 neutral]]
In his previous life, he had relied on setting up a formation to launch a sneak attack, barely managing to suppress Zhao Xuhe when his energy was depleted. This time, it wouldn't be so troublesome. [[1473 旁白 neutral]]
Even in a direct confrontation, he was confident he could escape! [[1474 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Wang, have you been well?" [[1475 吕阳 happy]]
Arriving at the Library Pavilion, Lv Yang skillfully took out a wine gourd and smiled. "This is top-quality Drunken Flower Brew, which I specially got for you." [[1476 吕阳 happy]]
"...It's you again, kid." [[1477 王柏荣 neutral]]
At the entrance of the Library Pavilion, the old-looking Wang Borong's eye twitched slightly upon hearing this, and then he remarked, "A single gourd of Drunken Flower Brew costs 50 contribution points." [[1478 王柏荣 surprised]]
"You've really struck it rich, kid." [[1479 王柏荣 surprised]]
In this life, Lv Yang had made a special effort to build a good relationship with Wang Borong. At first, Wang Borong had been indifferent to him, but ever since the Death-Substitution Yin Puppet market crashed, this senior from the Library Pavilion had a much better attitude towards him. [[1480 旁白 neutral]]
The reason was simple. [[1481 旁白 neutral]]
Just before the market crashed, he had persuaded Wang Borong to sell a portion of his hoarded goods, allowing him to avoid financial ruin. [[1482 旁白 neutral]]
Since then, Wang Borong had been incredibly grateful to him. [[1483 旁白 neutral]]
"To think I've lived for decades and still don't see things as clearly as a young man like you. If you hadn't warned me, I'd probably be suffering from cultivation deviation by now." [[1484 王柏荣 happy]]
"Not at all, Senior Brother. You shouldn't underestimate yourself." [[1485 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang shook his head. "As they say, good advice is lost on those who are doomed. I advised many people that day, but only you, Senior Brother, truly listened." [[1486 吕阳 neutral]]
"Your courage to pull back from the brink is also a form of wisdom." [[1487 吕阳 neutral]]
"Hmm..." [[1488 王柏荣 happy]]
Wang Borong narrowed his eyes and stroked his beard. Although he knew Lv Yang was deliberately flattering him, the words were incredibly pleasing to his ears. [[1489 王柏荣 happy]]
Then, the two set up a table and chairs and began to drink together. [[1490 旁白 neutral]]
Wang Borong didn't hold back, pouring himself a full cup of Drunken Flower Brew and downing it in one go before slowly speaking, "Kid, what are you really after?" [[1491 王柏荣 neutral]]
This was the only question left in Wang Borong's mind. [[1492 旁白 neutral]]
"We're not related in any way. Surely you don't believe the rumors outside, that I'm some hidden master in the Library Pavilion waiting for a destined person, do you?" [[1493 王柏荣 neutral]]
"Of course not." [[1494 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang poured more wine for Wang Borong and smiled. "As the saying goes, an elder in the family is like a treasure. I just think that for you to live to such an old age in the Chu Sheng Sect, you must be quite capable. And since you work in the Library Pavilion, perhaps you could give me some guidance on techniques and skills..." [[1495 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang spoke with great sincerity. [[1496 旁白 neutral]]
Wang Borong listened without commenting, simply continuing to pour wine. As he drank, he began to complain about the sect's shamelessness in fleecing the disciples this time. [[1497 旁白 neutral]]
"They are simply beasts!" [[1498 王柏荣 angry]]
"It's too much of a coincidence that they suppressed the price right when it peaked. This must have been premeditated. There are villains among the sect's upper echelons!" [[1499 王柏荣 angry]]
Lv Yang poured wine while casually agreeing. [[1500 吕阳 neutral]]
Only when Wang Borong was drunk and swaying did he lower his voice and say, "Senior Brother, I came here this time to choose a technique." [[1501 吕阳 neutral]]
"Do you have any recommendations? The more powerful the technique, the better!" [[1502 吕阳 neutral]]
"I knew you wanted something from me!" Wang Borong chuckled, then said proudly, "But you've asked the right person!" [[1503 王柏荣 happy]]
Lv Yang quickly cupped his hands. "Please enlighten me, Senior Brother." [[1504 吕阳 happy]]
"First of all, you can forget about the truly top-tier techniques. This Library Pavilion is just a branch of Sky Mending Peak, and the power of its techniques is limited." [[1505 王柏荣 neutral]]
"The truly powerful techniques are on the Sacred Fire Cliff, and only True Disciples can learn them!" [[1506 王柏荣 neutral]]
"But this is normal. Disciples like us in the early and middle stages of Qi Refining are just cattle and horses for the sect. How could we be taught powerful techniques?" [[1507 王柏荣 neutral]]
After all, what's the point of cattle and horses knowing so much? Knowing too much is bad for unity. [[1508 旁白 neutral]]
As for the True Disciples, they were officially part of the sect, elites who would inherit its legacy in the future. Naturally, they received different treatment. [[1509 旁白 neutral]]
"Is there no middle ground?" Lv Yang asked in a low voice. [[1510 吕阳 neutral]]
"Of course there is!" [[1511 王柏荣 happy]]
Wang Borong smiled. He had worked in the Library Pavilion for over forty years. With his experience, there wasn't a single technique he didn't know about. [[1512 旁白 neutral]]
Although he didn't know the specific content, he was well aware of their effects after they were mastered. [[1513 旁白 neutral]]
"In our Library Pavilion, there are really only three techniques that are truly powerful after being mastered, and each one has serious side effects." [[1514 王柏荣 neutral]]
"Side effects?" [[1515 吕阳 surprised]]
At this point, Wang Borong's expression became extremely solemn as he said in a deep voice, "For example, I know of a technique called the 'Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light.' It greatly increases a magical treasure's power by sacrificing one's own body to it. But after mastering it, not only does it shorten your lifespan, but you can no longer continue to cultivate. It's a dead end for your cultivation path." [[1516 王柏荣 neutral]]
"Tell me, aren't those side effects severe?" [[1517 王柏荣 fearful]]
Wang Borong's intention was to scare Lv Yang off, but he didn't expect that after hearing his warning, Lv Yang showed no disappointment and instead became even more excited. [[1518 旁白 neutral]]
"Such a technique is perfect for me!" [[1519 吕阳 happy]]
Although the side effects were indeed severe, they were limited to this life. And what did the side effects of this life have to do with him in the next one? [[1520 旁白 neutral]]
He seemed to have found the correct way to use the Hundred Lives Book! [[1521 吕阳 happy]]
