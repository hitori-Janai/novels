Chapter 6: The Demonic Sect's Cultivation Method [[473 旁白 neutral]]
As he walked into the Library Pavilion, he saw an old man, about sixty years old, lying lazily on a rocking chair. He was enjoying the sun and carefully reading a Daoist book. [[474 旁白 neutral]]
The moment Lv Yang entered, the old man looked over. [[475 旁白 neutral]]
"Another new disciple?" [[476 老人 neutral]]
The old man said calmly, "Go inside and choose for yourself. Remember to follow the rules written there. If you die, don't blame me for not warning you." [[477 老人 neutral]]
"Thank you for your guidance, Senior." [[478 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang clasped his hands and walked towards the bookshelves. [[479 旁白 neutral]]
Sure enough, as he got closer, the disciple token on his waist seemed to sense something. A faint light appeared and then turned into lines of text in the air. [[480 旁白 neutral]]
"Lv Yang, disciple of Sky Mending Peak." [[481 旁白 neutral]]
"You can receive the secret technique of Sky Mending Peak, the 'Dragon-Tiger Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra,' for free. Also, for your first technique exchange, you can use a loan with no down payment." [[482 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang accepted it without hesitation. [[483 旁白 neutral]]
In the next second, the content of the technique appeared on his disciple token. Lv Yang's mind was soon absorbed in it, and it took a long time for him to come back to his senses. [[484 旁白 neutral]]
"Why is this technique, like the Innate Dao Scripture, also split into two parts?" Remembering the outcome of his past life, Lv Yang's expression turned ugly. "The Dragon-Tiger Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra... when perfected, it can create a Yin-Yang Dragon-Tiger Qi, ranking as a fifth-grade technique. In theory, it leads directly to Foundation Establishment." [[485 吕阳 sad]]
"But they only gave me the Qi Refining part!" [[486 吕阳 angry]]
With the lesson from his previous life, Lv Yang was extremely wary of this kind of incomplete technique. He even thought about giving up on cultivating it. [[487 旁白 neutral]]
But after thinking for a long time, he sighed. "I still have to practice it!" [[488 吕阳 sad]]
If he practiced, there might be hidden dangers in the future. [[489 旁白 neutral]]
If he didn't, he might not even have a future! [[490 旁白 fearful]]
Moreover, this "Dragon-Tiger Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra" was truly profound. It could not only absorb a target's vital energy but also their knowledge! [[491 旁白 neutral]]
Techniques, divine abilities, experience—he could absorb them all! [[492 旁白 neutral]]
"Besides that, a cultivator who has been drained by this technique will gradually have their thoughts controlled by the user. They will become devoted and unable to break free, eventually becoming a puppet willing to die for the user. It is a truly bizarre and extreme demonic art." [[493 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang studied the technique, silently understanding its principles. [[494 旁白 neutral]]
After another half hour, he tried to circulate his power. Two streams of True Qi flowed at his fingertips, forming a dragon and a tiger, about to merge into a new True Qi. [[495 旁白 neutral]]
"Ugh!" [[496 吕阳 sad]]
The next second, Lv Yang's face turned pale, and the True Qi at his fingertips disappeared. [[497 旁白 neutral]]
"It failed? That makes sense. Although I've mastered the theory, I haven't practiced it with someone yet. A dual cultivation technique isn't meant for one person to practice alone." [[498 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang was not discouraged and turned to look at the dazzling array of bookshelves before him. [[499 旁白 neutral]]
According to the rules of the Library Pavilion, as a new formal disciple, he had one more chance to get a technique or divine ability with a zero-down-payment loan. [[500 旁白 neutral]]
To Lv Yang's surprise, the Library Pavilion contained more than just demonic techniques. [[501 旁白 neutral]]
There were also many techniques that were clearly from orthodox righteous sects, covering a wide range of fields like divination, sword arts, and five-element magic. It had everything. [[502 旁白 neutral]]
"Lesser Heaven Interception Art, Supreme Taiyi Five Elements Righteous Method, True Explanation of Long Life, Divine Empyrean Sword Art..." [[503 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang browsed for a long time before finally making his choice. [[504 旁白 neutral]]
"Divine Empyrean Sword Art, Price: 1000 Contribution Points." [[505 旁白 neutral]]
"It is detected that this is your first exchange. You can take out a loan with no down payment, with an annual interest rate of thirty-six percent, to be paid off in ten years. Do you wish to exchange?" [[506 旁白 neutral]]
"How much???" [[507 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang almost cursed out loud. An annual interest rate of 36% meant he had to repay 460 contribution points each year. In ten years, that would be 4,600 points! [[508 吕阳 angry]]
A loan of 1,000, but a repayment of 4,600? [[509 吕阳 angry]]
This is pure exploitation! [[510 吕阳 angry]]
"Wait... I'm different!" [[511 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang's eyes suddenly lit up. A high-interest loan with no down payment might be a huge trap for others, but it meant nothing to him. [[512 旁白 neutral]]
If things go wrong, I can just restart. What does a loan from a past life have to do with me? [[513 吕阳 neutral]]
So, if he wanted, he could get all the techniques and divine abilities in the Library Pavilion for free! [[514 旁白 neutral]]
Since he had no intention of repaying, Lv Yang became much calmer. He immediately waved his hand and bought the "Divine Empyrean Sword Art" without batting an eye. [[515 旁白 neutral]]
Then, something unexpected happened. [[516 旁白 neutral]]
When he got the "Dragon-Tiger Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra," the technique's content was given directly. This time, however, Lv Yang only received a message: [[517 旁白 neutral]]
"The technique is being delivered and is expected to arrive at your cave residence within three days." [[518 旁白 neutral]]
"Please wait patiently." [[519 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the message on his disciple token, Lv Yang was a little confused. What did it mean that the technique was being delivered? Was this technique an original copy that hadn't been duplicated? [[520 吕阳 neutral]]
Despite his thoughts, Lv Yang believed the Chu Sheng Sect wouldn't just take his technique. [[521 旁白 neutral]]
Before leaving, he approached the old man at the entrance of the Library Pavilion again. [[522 旁白 neutral]]
"This Senior..." [[523 吕阳 neutral]]
As soon as Lv Yang bowed, the old man on the rocking chair spoke: "You don't have to call me Senior. I'm also a disciple in the sect, just a bit older than you." [[524 老人 neutral]]
Lv Yang was stunned for a moment, then corrected himself: "This Senior Brother, do you know if the sect provides cultivation partners for us to practice dual cultivation techniques with?" [[525 吕阳 neutral]]
Being in a demonic sect, Lv Yang naturally had no intention of staying pure and unstained. He wouldn't shy away from dual cultivation. He would use anything that could make him stronger. [[526 旁白 neutral]]
"A cultivation partner, huh..." [[527 老人 neutral]]
The old man glanced at Lv Yang and suddenly asked, "Did you take out a loan to buy a technique?" [[528 老人 neutral]]
Lv Yang paused for a moment, then nodded. [[529 吕阳 neutral]]
"Then you don't need to worry about that." [[530 老人 neutral]]
At this point, a curious smile appeared on the old man's face. "This technique loan is annoying, but it's not without its benefits..." [[531 老人 neutral]]
"Go back and wait!" [[532 老人 neutral]]
Lv Yang returned to his cave residence, completely confused. [[533 旁白 neutral]]
But he soon understood why the "Divine Empyrean Sword Art" needed time to be delivered and what the "benefit" the old man was talking about really was. [[534 旁白 neutral]]
Three days later, a box was delivered to the entrance of Lv Yang's cave residence. [[535 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang carried the box into the cave and opened it. [[536 旁白 neutral]]
Then he saw a heroic woman with a curvy figure and sharp phoenix eyes. Her hands and feet were tied, and she was stuffed inside the box. [[537 旁白 neutral]]
Although the woman was not a national beauty, she was naturally attractive. [[538 旁白 neutral]]
Her plain face, without any makeup, gave her a refined and elegant look. [[539 旁白 neutral]]
And because she had been in the stuffy box for too long, her body was covered in shiny beads of sweat, which trickled down her fair neck and into her collar. [[540 旁白 neutral]]
"Demonic Path!" [[541 陌生女1 angry]]
The woman looked at Lv Yang, her eyes filled with a hatred so intense she wanted to cut him into a thousand pieces. At the same time, she seemed to realize her fate, and despair appeared on her beautiful face. [[542 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang frowned at the sight. "Are you... a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion?" [[543 吕阳 surprised]]
"So what if I am?" The woman closed her beautiful eyes, and two lines of clear tears streamed down her fair cheeks. "Just kill me!" [[544 陌生女1 sad]]
Lv Yang finally understood. [[545 旁白 neutral]]
The "Divine Empyrean Sword Art" was the secret divine ability of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, the leader of the righteous path in the south. He had been wondering where the Chu Sheng Sect got it from. [[546 旁白 neutral]]
Now he understood. [[547 旁白 neutral]]
The Dragon-Tiger Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra could absorb a target's knowledge and experience, and the Chu Sheng Sect had directly provided him with a formal disciple from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion. [[548 旁白 neutral]]
In other words, if he wanted the "Divine Empyrean Sword Art," he just had to absorb it from her. [[549 旁白 neutral]]
"This way, the technique is passed on, and the disciple's need for a cultivation partner is solved. It's killing two birds with one stone, maximizing the value..." [[550 吕阳 neutral]]
Making the most of everything. This was truly the style of the Saint Sect. [[551 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to the hard cultivation of the righteous sects, who train through winter's cold and summer's heat, this was the true cultivation method of the demonic path. [[552 旁白 neutral]]
