Chapter 4: Impossible to Guard Against [[283 旁白 neutral]]
"The body is formed from Innate True Qi. Refining qi is refining oneself. Purify yourself, return to your innate state, and you can achieve a perfect form and spirit." [[284 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, Lv Yang opened his eyes, his face showing his joy. [[285 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to the Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra, the Innate Dao Scripture actually looked like a complete cultivation manual. [[286 旁白 neutral]]
The entire scripture started from the basics. It began with a set of exercises to strengthen the body, and even included a matching martial art called the Innate Great Grappling Hand. [[287 旁白 neutral]]
Once the body was fully developed, the cultivator would begin to "reverse to the innate." They would first transform their organs, then their flesh and bones, until finally their physical form dissolved into a stream of Innate True Qi. From then on, they could appear and disappear at will, be resistant to magical attacks, and hold an unbeatable advantage in battles. [[288 旁白 neutral]]
In addition, the scripture also described many spells that worked with Innate True Qi. [[289 旁白 neutral]]
The sheer number and variety of spells, like the Heavenly Net Dust Smoke, the Single-Minded Qi Sword, and the Spirit-Absorbing Technique, were a real eye-opener for Lv Yang. [[290 旁白 neutral]]
However, just as he was completely absorbed in reading, Lv Yang suddenly paused. [[291 旁白 neutral]]
"...Why did it stop?" [[292 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang instinctively looked up at Liu Xin and realized the 'Innate Dao Scripture' in his hands was only the first half. The content stopped suddenly. [[293 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, techniques are not given out freely." [[294 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin chuckled. "The second half of the Innate Dao Scripture contains the secrets to Foundation Establishment. It's not included in the sect's benefits. You need to exchange contribution points for it." [[295 刘信 neutral]]
Hearing this, Lv Yang shook his head with a sense of helplessness. "I see. I lost my composure." [[296 吕阳 neutral]]
"Don't worry, half of the scripture is enough for your cultivation." [[297 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin patted Lv Yang's shoulder in a friendly way. "Let's go. I'll take you to Sky Mending Peak to choose a cave residence. Pick a good place so we can visit each other often in the future." [[298 刘信 neutral]]
Lv Yang nodded. "Thank you, Senior Brother." [[299 吕阳 neutral]]
An hour later, at Sky Mending Peak. [[300 旁白 neutral]]
In a remote cave residence at the foot of the mountain, Lv Yang officially settled in. The original furniture inside was cleared out like trash. [[301 旁白 neutral]]
Watching this, Lv Yang's mind was filled with thoughts. [[302 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems being a Formal Disciple isn't easy either..." [[303 吕阳 neutral]]
Sky Mending Peak wasn't very large. The Chu Sheng Sect took in so many in-name disciples every year that even with a one-in-ten-thousand promotion rate, there should be enough to fill the peak. [[304 旁白 neutral]]
But what was the reality? [[305 旁白 neutral]]
As Lv Yang walked, he saw that Sky Mending Peak was far from crowded. It was actually a bit empty. Many cave residences were vacant, with no disciples living in them. [[306 旁白 neutral]]
Where did all the formal disciples go? Surely they could afford to rent a cave residence? [[307 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang shook his head and didn't think about it further. He took out a cushion, sat down with his legs crossed, and began his first cultivation session in the cave residence. [[308 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't noticed before, but once he started cultivating, Lv Yang felt a surge of spiritual energy, almost double that of the outer sect, rush into his body. It flowed into his dantian, circulated through his meridians, and gradually seeped into his organs, flesh, and bones. [[309 旁白 neutral]]
The efficiency was so high that it surprised Lv Yang. [[310 旁白 neutral]]
With the same technique, the amount of true qi he could refine in one day in the outer sect could be achieved in just two hours here in the inner sect cave. [[311 旁白 neutral]]
"No wonder you have to pay to rent a cave in the inner sect." [[312 吕阳 neutral]]
It's easy to go from a simple life to a luxurious one, but hard to go back. Once you experience the speed of cultivating in a cave residence, it's difficult to tolerate cultivating anywhere else. [[313 旁白 neutral]]
The next day, Lv Yang stayed in his cave, cultivating and reading the Innate Dao Scripture. [[314 旁白 neutral]]
"In this world, cultivation depends on talent, but there's no concept of 'spirit roots.' Basically, anyone can start cultivating if they want to." [[315 吕阳 neutral]]
Even so, cultivation wasn't much easier. [[316 旁白 neutral]]
Although mortals didn't need spirit roots to start cultivating, the quality of the true qi they refined still determined their future potential. [[317 旁白 neutral]]
This was the importance of the "technique." [[318 旁白 neutral]]
The better the technique, the higher the quality of the true qi, and the greater the chance of reaching a higher realm. The opposite was also true, making it more likely to hit a bottleneck. [[319 旁白 neutral]]
True qi was divided into nine grades and thirty-six ranks. The lower the grade, the better, and the higher the rank, the stronger. [[320 旁白 neutral]]
Generally, with true qi below the seventh grade, one could not reach Foundation Establishment. Below the third grade, it was difficult to form a Golden Core. And trying to reach Nascent Soul without first-grade qi was almost certainly fatal. [[321 旁白 neutral]]
"It's tough to be a rogue cultivator." [[322 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang couldn't help but sigh. Compared to large sects with complete teachings, rogue cultivators had no choice in their techniques; they had to practice whatever they could find. [[323 旁白 neutral]]
In this situation, even the most talented people were at a disadvantage from the start and would live with regret. [[324 旁白 neutral]]
The difficulty of cultivation was clear to see. [[325 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang's brow gradually furrowed. [[326 旁白 neutral]]
"The 'Innate True Qi' from the 'Innate Dao Scripture' is sixth-grade, first-rank. A cultivator has a chance to reach Foundation Establishment. Strictly speaking, that's not weak." [[327 吕阳 neutral]]
But it still didn't meet his expectations. [[328 旁白 neutral]]
If he were just an ordinary cultivator, it would be fine. [[329 旁白 neutral]]
But he possessed the miraculous Hundred Lives Book. His future was promising, so a technique that stopped at Foundation Establishment could no longer satisfy him. [[330 旁白 neutral]]
"If only I could get a supreme first-grade technique..." [[331 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang imagined it for a moment, then sighed. "Forget it. I have to take things one step at a time. If I take too big a step, I might trip." [[332 吕阳 neutral]]
"First, I'll practice the Innate Dao Scripture and become a Foundation Establishment master." [[333 旁白 neutral]]
Once he established his foundation, he would live for three hundred years, almost as long as a mortal dynasty. In the cultivation world, he could be called a "master." [[334 旁白 neutral]]
Once he was strong enough, he would seek a higher-level technique. As soon as he got it, he would start over. [[335 旁白 neutral]]
By repeating this cycle, his dream would eventually come true. [[336 旁白 neutral]]
As long as he was patient and didn't rush, time would always be his friend. This was the confidence the Hundred Lives Book gave him. [[337 旁白 neutral]]
Ten days later, in Lv Yang's cave residence. [[338 旁白 neutral]]
A white vapor rose and swirled, sometimes turning into black smoke, sometimes into an invisible qi sword, and finally into the graceful figure of a person. [[339 旁白 neutral]]
"I did it!" [[340 吕阳 happy]]
Although the Innate Dao Scripture was profound, it wasn't difficult to practice. In just ten days, Lv Yang had successfully dissolved his physical form and refined his body into a stream of true qi. [[341 旁白 neutral]]
[Name: Lv Yang] [[342 旁白 neutral]]
[Lifespan: 18] [[343 旁白 neutral]]
[Cultivation: Qi Refining, Level 1] [[344 旁白 neutral]]
[Talent: Dual Cultivation Prodigy (White)] [[345 旁白 neutral]]
[Techniques: Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra (Mastered), Innate Qi Refining and Body Transformation Art (Mastered)] [[346 旁白 neutral]]
[Abilities: None] [[347 旁白 neutral]]
[Treasures: None] [[348 旁白 neutral]]
[Hundred Lives Book Pages: 99] [[349 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the updated information on the Hundred Lives Book, Lv Yang stepped into the air, feeling better than ever. Even the venereal disease from his original body was gone. [[350 旁白 neutral]]
"Hm?" [[351 吕阳 surprised]]
Suddenly, the pleased expression on Lv Yang's face disappeared. He frowned, stopped, and looked at the Hundred Lives Book again, lost in thought. [[352 旁白 neutral]]
"...Something's wrong." [[353 吕阳 fearful]]
He felt like he had missed something. [[354 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang began to recall the events of this life. He had become a formal disciple without any trouble and had easily received the Innate Dao Scripture... [[355 旁白 neutral]]
In the next second, Lv Yang finally realized what he had missed. [[356 旁白 neutral]]
[After absorbing your essence, Yu Suzhen broke through to the Qi Refining realm. Unfortunately, the venereal disease was deeply rooted, and she couldn't get rid of it with her true qi. She was bedridden for several months and eventually died from the illness.] [[357 旁白 neutral]]
In the last life, why did Senior Sister Yu die? [[358 旁白 neutral]]
Since she was a formal disciple, she must have also received the Innate Dao Scripture. As long as she successfully cultivated it and transformed her body, how could she have died from a venereal disease? [[359 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't master it? [[360 旁白 neutral]]
"Impossible!" Lv Yang shook his head. [[361 吕阳 fearful]]
The Innate Dao Scripture wasn't that hard to practice. Since Yu Suzhen was able to break through to the Qi Refining realm, she couldn't have been so untalented that she failed to master it in a few months. [[362 旁白 neutral]]
"Unless... she wasn't practicing the Innate Dao Scripture at all!" [[363 吕阳 fearful]]
At that moment, Lv Yang felt a chill run down his spine. [[364 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of his heartbeat was clearer than ever, his breathing became rapid, and the excitement quickly faded from his face. [[365 旁白 neutral]]
"Was the Innate Dao Scripture... prepared specifically for me by Liu Xin?" [[366 吕阳 fearful]]
Lv Yang remembered the scene he had witnessed at the Treasure Refining Hall. [[367 旁白 neutral]]
The in-name disciple from the hall thought he had achieved enlightenment, but he was actually walking to his doom. Instead of breaking through, he had refined himself into a magic treasure. [[368 旁白 neutral]]
Was his current situation just like that one? [[369 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a familiar and friendly voice called from outside his cave. [[370 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv, are you there?" [[371 刘信 neutral]]
