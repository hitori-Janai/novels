Chapter 9: Riches Move the Heart of Men [[713 旁白 neutral]]
"Demon, are you in a bad mood?" [[714 云妙清 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing spoke as she looked up at Lv Yang, who was resting with his eyes closed. [[715 旁白 neutral]]
"A little." [[716 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang sighed and casually explained the difficult situation he was in. [[717 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a demonic sect. It treats its disciples like disposable materials, without any humanity," Yun Miaoqing said softly. [[718 云妙清 sad]]
"Demon... Fellow Daoist Lv, you have good talent and a fine character. Why must you compromise in this demonic sect?" Yun Miaoqing said. "If you remove the restrictions on me and help me escape, I can introduce you to become a disciple of my Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion." [[719 云妙清 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing was looking for death, but he had no interest in joining her. [[720 旁白 neutral]]
When poor, one should focus on improving oneself. The urgent task was still how to raise his own strength. [[721 旁白 neutral]]
After careful consideration, Lv Yang did not buy the Yin-Yang Immortal Flower. Instead, he spent all his money on ten Great Yuanqi Pills that could increase his cultivation. [[722 旁白 neutral]]
"This life has basically reached a dead end." [[723 吕阳 sad]]
"After all, I don't plan to repay the loan, nor am I willing to waste decades as a workhorse. When the loan is due, I will surely die without a burial place." [[724 吕阳 sad]]
"So I must use this time to improve myself as quickly as possible!" [[725 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang had already made up his mind. When he reincarnated into his next life, he would choose to keep his cultivation. To do that, he had to raise his strength to a higher level as soon as possible. [[726 旁白 neutral]]
"If my cultivation is too low, Liu Xin, who was present at the time, might see through it. So I must at least reach the same realm as he was." Lv Yang thought to himself, "I need to reach the mid-stage of Qi Refining at least, and use a breath-concealing technique. Only then can I possibly deceive him." [[727 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang dared to think this way because he was confident. [[728 旁白 neutral]]
The Qi Refining realm has ten layers, divided into early, middle, late, and peak stages. Within these smaller stages, there are basically no bottlenecks. One can break through simply by accumulating enough energy. [[729 旁白 neutral]]
What truly trapped many Qi Refining cultivators were the bottlenecks between the smaller stages. [[730 旁白 neutral]]
From the early to middle stage, middle to late stage, and late to peak stage, the difficulty increased exponentially, preventing countless cultivators from advancing. [[731 旁白 neutral]]
"According to my calculations, ten Great Yuanqi Pills plus the spiritual energy from my cave residence are enough for me to break through to the third layer of Qi Refining. In fact, this is the cultivation level of most disciples in the sect. They improve by spending a lot of time and gaining seniority, only to get stuck at the bottleneck of the early Qi Refining stage and become workhorses for the sect." [[732 吕阳 neutral]]
If nothing unexpected happened, Lv Yang would be one of them. [[733 旁白 neutral]]
But in this life, he held an unknown variable in his hands. [[734 旁白 neutral]]
With a thought, a wisp of steaming white Qi appeared in Lv Yang's hand. It moved like an extension of his arm, sometimes taking the shape of a sword, other times turning into thick smoke. [[735 旁白 neutral]]
Innate True Qi! [[736 旁白 surprised]]
"According to Liu Xin, the greatest use of Innate True Qi is to help people break through bottlenecks. His own breakthrough to the late stage of Qi Refining was definitely thanks to it." [[737 吕阳 neutral]]
Liu Xin could use it to break through to the late stage of Qi Refining. [[738 旁白 neutral]]
It shouldn't be a problem for me to use it to break through to the mid-stage. [[739 吕阳 neutral]]
"As long as I break through to the mid-stage of Qi Refining, this life won't be a waste. At worst, I can just reincarnate immediately. With a higher cultivation in the next life, my starting point will be better!" [[740 吕阳 neutral]]
A moment later, a voice came from outside his cave residence. [[741 旁白 neutral]]
His Great Yuanqi Pills had arrived. [[742 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang pushed the door open and saw a woman standing outside. She was dressed in simple clothes, with a beauty that matched Yun Miaoqing's, and a figure that was even more voluptuous. [[743 旁白 neutral]]
"I am Qingchen. Greetings, Junior Brother Lv." The woman curtsied and then smiled softly. Her laugh seemed to have a magical quality that captivated the heart, making one feel favorable towards her. "I have been ordered to deliver the Great Yuanqi Pills you purchased. Please take out your token for verification." [[744 清尘 neutral]]
Lv Yang knew the process and did as he was told. [[745 旁白 neutral]]
As they completed the transaction, Fairy Qingchen probed gently, "Junior Brother, you were able to buy so many pills. Did you come into a fortune somewhere?" [[746 清尘 neutral]]
"What are you talking about, Senior Sister?" [[747 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang shook his head with a bitter look. "I just took out several loans. I was thinking of improving my cultivation so I could take on some high-paying missions." [[748 吕阳 sad]]
"I see." [[749 清尘 neutral]]
Fairy Qingchen nodded with a look of concern. "Junior Brother, you don't have to be so modest. Which of us formal disciples doesn't have a few loans?" [[750 清尘 neutral]]
"But... if you don't mind me being direct, Junior Brother, you still don't know how to be flexible." [[751 清尘 neutral]]
"Oh?" [[752 吕阳 surprised]]
Seeing that Lv Yang was interested, Fairy Qingchen smiled faintly. "There are only so many sect missions. How could you possibly repay so many loans just by doing missions?" [[753 清尘 neutral]]
"In the Holy Sect, you'll never get rich by following the usual path," Fairy Qingchen said softly. "I thought you had found a cave residence left by a senior brother and received his inheritance, which is why you made a fortune. That's why I was bold enough to ask, but it seems that's not the case." [[754 清尘 neutral]]
"A cave residence..." [[755 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's eyes lowered, his expression unreadable, but his tone sounded intrigued. "I am slow-witted. Could Senior Sister please explain in detail?" [[756 吕阳 neutral]]
"Does Junior Brother know that the Holy Sect was established in the 'Cloud Sea of Reaching Heaven'?" [[757 清尘 neutral]]
Fairy Qingchen said calmly, "Within the Cloud Sea, besides the Four Inner Peaks, there are many other peaks established by former true disciples and elders." [[758 清尘 neutral]]
"However, the path of cultivation is long, and many have fallen over the years. But after they fall, their cave residences are not removed. They remain in the Cloud Sea. Although there are some risks, each one is an opportunity. Any small find can be exchanged for a large number of contribution points!" [[759 清尘 neutral]]
"If you are interested, Junior Brother, I recently discovered a relatively safe cave residence..." [[760 清尘 neutral]]
Really? I don't believe it! [[761 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang sneered inwardly. Fairy Qingchen's persuasive manner was just like Liu Xin from his previous life, who tricked him into cultivating the Innate Dao Scripture. [[762 旁白 neutral]]
This is a trap! [[763 旁白 angry]]
What cave residence opportunity? It's just bait. [[764 旁白 angry]]
It seems I've revealed my wealth. Seeing a new disciple like me buy so many spirit pills, she wants to trick me into going out so she can kill me and take them for herself. [[765 旁白 angry]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang showed a look of interest. "I need to think about it." [[766 吕阳 neutral]]
"There's no hurry," Fairy Qingchen nodded. "The verification is complete. You can contact me after you've considered it." [[767 清尘 neutral]]
"I've thought about it. I'm not going." [[768 吕阳 neutral]]
Seeing the transaction was complete, Lv Yang picked up the bottle of pills without another word and returned to his cave, leaving Fairy Qingchen standing alone. [[769 旁白 neutral]]
"???" [[770 清尘 surprised]]
A moment later, the recovering Fairy Qingchen nearly ground her teeth to dust, her pretty face filled with killing intent. "This Lv Yang... how dare he trick me!" [[771 清尘 angry]]
Turning to leave, Fairy Qingchen soon arrived at another cave residence. [[772 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the cave, a young Daoist in fine robes had been waiting. Seeing Qingchen's unpleasant expression, he frowned as well. [[773 旁白 neutral]]
"You didn't succeed?" [[774 赵旭河 neutral]]
Fairy Qingchen shook her head. "This person... is a bit too cautious." [[775 清尘 sad]]
"And Senior Brother Zhao, he borrowed money but didn't buy the Yin-Yang Immortal Flower. Instead, he bought pills. I suspect he never intended to repay the money at all." [[776 清尘 neutral]]
"He wants to default on his debt? In his next life!" [[777 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe sneered and shook his head. "Did you know that the sect secretly puts a price on every new disciple?" [[778 赵旭河 neutral]]
"And the amount a disciple can borrow from the sect will never exceed his price. This is to ensure that the sect can recover its costs no matter what happens. Flesh and blood, organs, soul... these are all valuable things, more than enough to repay the debt." [[779 赵旭河 neutral]]
"He wants to improve his cultivation? Let him." [[780 赵旭河 neutral]]
"As long as he's still here, a higher cultivation level makes him even more valuable." [[781 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe grinned, a bloody taste seeming to flow between his teeth. "At that time, not only will we not lose, we might even make a profit." [[782 赵旭河 happy]]
"Besides, he may have the money to buy these pills, but he might not have the life to use them, right?" [[783 赵旭河 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, you mean..." [[784 清尘 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe nodded slightly and said meaningfully, "Many things are fine as long as they are not discovered." [[785 赵旭河 neutral]]
Upon hearing this, Fairy Qingchen's beautiful eyes lit up. [[786 清尘 happy]]
