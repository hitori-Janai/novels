Chapter 26: As Expected of the Saint Sect [[2058 旁白 neutral]]
The landscape was like a painting, the setting sun like blood. [[2059 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang stood on the sea of clouds. After waiting for a long time without a palm from the sky smashing him to dust, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. [[2060 旁白 neutral]]
"Was that... a Foundation Establishment master?" [[2061 吕阳 fearful]]
Lv Yang didn't even dare to mutter to himself and could only ponder it in his heart. His expression turned grim; after all, the gap between them was simply too vast. [[2062 旁白 fearful]]
Not only his body, but even his mind was frozen. He only reacted after Daoist Hongyun left. The feeling was like a mouse in a cat's paw. It was no longer a matter of a gap in strength, but a difference in their level of existence. All the pride in Lv Yang's heart was instantly shattered. [[2063 旁白 fearful]]
"I'm still too weak, I have no power." [[2064 吕阳 sad]]
After defeating Liu Xin and his group against the odds, Lv Yang had swept away the gloom of his past life and felt on top of the world. But now, he had calmed down again. [[2065 旁白 neutral]]
The immortal path was long, and he still had a long way to go. [[2066 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang sighed, then he recalled what happened with Xiao Shiye, and fear filled his eyes again. "Luck... can it actually be given by someone else?" [[2067 吕阳 fearful]]
Now, he remembered. [[2068 旁白 neutral]]
Before going to the Merit Pool, Xiao Shiye had said, "It just so happens I've been quite lucky recently, so I want to take the opportunity to try my luck." [[2069 萧石叶 neutral]]
'Lucky recently.' [[2070 旁白 neutral]]
At the time, Lv Yang had thought it was just the child of destiny being humble. But now it seemed that it might have been the truth—he really had only become lucky recently. [[2071 旁白 neutral]]
Because of that Daoist Hongyun! [[2072 旁白 fearful]]
"The 'colored fish' in the Merit Pool must be the Rainbow Merit Fish. Does Daoist Hongyun want to use Xiao Shiye to fish it out of the Merit Pool?" [[2073 吕阳 neutral]]
"If that's true, then he succeeded in the last life. However, after Xiao Shiye fished out the Rainbow Merit Fish in the last life, he announced he was entering seclusion and was never heard from again." Lv Yang's blood ran cold as he thought about it. Fishing, fishing... once the fish is caught, is the bait no longer needed? [[2074 吕阳 fearful]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang suddenly raised his head. [[2075 旁白 neutral]]
The Chu Sheng Sect, a sea of clouds touching the sky. [[2076 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps to the elusive leaders of the Saint Sect, these so-called disciples were nothing more than a school of fish being raised in a pond. [[2077 旁白 fearful]]
"As expected of the Saint Sect..." [[2078 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang took a deep breath, beginning to understand why no one had killed him. [[2079 旁白 neutral]]
So what if a fish jumped around a little more actively and had some secrets? Maybe they would even think you were talented! [[2080 旁白 neutral]]
"In any case, at least the secret of The Hundred Lives Book was not exposed." Lv Yang felt lucky. Moreover, the karma related to The Hundred Lives Book seemed to have been hidden from Daoist Hongyun, so he didn't suspect why Lv Yang had reached the fourth level of Qi Refining before even joining the sect. [[2081 吕阳 neutral]]
"No time to waste. I should go back and eat first." [[2082 吕阳 neutral]]
Fortunately, although Daoist Hongyun had taken away the Innate Dao Scripture, Lv Yang had already memorized all of its contents. [[2083 旁白 neutral]]
This was a good habit Lv Yang had developed because of The Hundred Lives Book. [[2084 旁白 neutral]]
Whenever he encountered a good technique or ability, he would immediately memorize it. That way, he could use it in his next life without having to spend Contribution Points to get it again. [[2085 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, Daoist Hongyun had taken the Innate Dao Scripture, but he hadn't taken Fairy Qingchen's Secret Manual of Array Treasures. [[2086 旁白 neutral]]
"Of course, the two can't be compared. What Fairy Qingchen made is obviously not worthy of that person's attention... but it's very useful to me." [[2087 吕阳 happy]]
In fact, Lv Yang didn't care much about the Innate Dao Scripture. He had already set his sights on Zhao Xuhe's third-grade true technique. The Innate Dao Scripture was not essential, but he was very interested in cultivation skills like the Secret Manual of Array Treasures, which involved setting up formations and refining treasures. [[2088 旁白 neutral]]
As for the Innate True Qi Myriad Souls Banner... [[2089 旁白 neutral]]
"There will always be a chance. Let's worry about it in the next life." [[2090 吕阳 neutral]]
Returning to his cave residence, Lv Yang patiently focused on his cultivation. He studied the Secret Manual of Array Treasures while slowly repairing the damage to his sword core. [[2091 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't come out of seclusion until half a month later. [[2092 旁白 neutral]]
This time, he went to find Zhao Xuhe. [[2093 旁白 neutral]]
When he arrived at Zhao Xuhe's cave residence, he saw Zhao Xuhe arguing with a stern-looking young man wearing the uniform of the Hall of Enforcement. [[2094 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, you have to believe me! Don't you know my reputation? It's been great for over ten years! It's just 1000 Contribution Points, I'll definitely pay it back... What? Interest!? You... fine. Senior Brother, just give me a few more days, and I'll definitely pay back the principal and the interest." [[2095 赵旭河 fearful]]
After a moment of argument, the disciple from the Hall of Enforcement left with a cold smile. [[2096 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe stood there with a gloomy face, his qi fluctuating around him. Seeing it was a good time, Lv Yang appeared and walked over. [[2097 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Zhao, long time no see." [[2098 吕阳 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe looked up and immediately noticed Lv Yang's unconcealed qi. His pupils shrank. "Junior Brother Lv, you've broken through to the late stage of Qi Refining!?" [[2099 赵旭河 surprised]]
"Just lucky, just lucky." [[2100 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang smiled slightly and said, "I am not very talented. I spent several months in seclusion and used a lot of Contribution Points to make this lucky breakthrough. I've made a fool of myself in front of you, Senior Brother." [[2101 吕阳 neutral]]
Hearing this, Zhao Xuhe's expression became even more rigid, almost distorted. After all, they had both speculated on the Death-Substitute Yin Puppets. He had lost everything, and even his lover had left him for someone else. But Lv Yang had made a fortune and even used the Contribution Points he earned to break through to the late stage of Qi Refining. [[2102 旁白 neutral]]
What made him even angrier was that he was probably no match for Lv Yang now! [[2103 旁白 neutral]]
"I received Master Panlong's opportunity, but because I didn't have enough luck or merit, I only got half of the third-grade true technique." [[2104 赵旭河 sad]]
He had even specially asked his master about this. [[2105 旁白 neutral]]
His master had deduced the karma and concluded that it was because he had speculated on the Death-Substitute Yin Puppets, using up three lifetimes of accumulated merit in advance, which led to his failure. [[2106 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe nearly ground his teeth to dust. [[2107 旁白 angry]]
Half of a third-grade true technique, with only the Qi Refining section, the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art," and missing the Foundation Establishment part. It was completely useless to him! [[2108 旁白 angry]]
Not to mention he was now in debt. He didn't even dare to disperse his cultivation to switch techniques, afraid that debt collectors would show up while he was weak. If they saw he was powerless after dispersing his cultivation, they might just turn into robbers, steal everything from him, and then kill him to silence him. Then he would truly have no one to complain to. [[2109 旁白 fearful]]
"Junior Brother, is there something you need from me?" [[2110 赵旭河 neutral]]
"It's a long story." Lv Yang sighed. "To be honest, Senior Brother, I came to ask for your guidance. I've run into some trouble recently." [[2111 吕阳 sad]]
"Trouble?" Zhao Xuhe's eyes lit up. [[2112 赵旭河 surprised]]
Lv Yang sighed and said, "I was so focused on cultivating that I only learned about the issue of True Qi quality after breaking through to the late stage of Qi Refining. I regret it so much." [[2113 吕阳 sad]]
Hearing Lv Yang say this, Zhao Xuhe suddenly felt much better. [[2114 旁白 neutral]]
"So it's about the quality of your True Qi." [[2115 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe offered some fake comfort, "Most disciples in the Saint Sect don't realize this, so it's normal that you didn't know." [[2116 赵旭河 neutral]]
"Sigh, life is unpredictable." Lv Yang shook his head helplessly. "That's why I came to you, Senior Brother, to ask if there's a way to improve the quality of my True Qi. It would be even better if there was a high-grade technique. Don't worry about the price; I can afford one or two thousand Contribution Points." [[2117 吕阳 neutral]]
"...Oh?" [[2118 赵旭河 surprised]]
Hearing this, Zhao Xuhe's mind started working. One or two thousand Contribution Points—that was exactly the amount of money he urgently needed right now. [[2119 旁白 neutral]]
In a flash, Zhao Xuhe's thoughts raced, and he suddenly said: [[2120 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv, if you put it that way... I do have a technique that's perfect for you. As long as you cultivate it, you can definitely improve the quality of your True Qi." [[2121 赵旭河 neutral]]
"Really?" Lv Yang's face filled with anticipation. "What technique is it?" [[2122 吕阳 happy]]
Zhao Xuhe hesitated, feeling that something was strange, but then he thought again. This technique was only half a book, it was already useless. [[2123 旁白 neutral]]
Instead of keeping it, it was better to make use of this waste and use it to pay off his debt. [[2124 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe gritted his teeth and took out the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art" that he had obtained from Panlong Island, handing it to Lv Yang. [[2125 旁白 neutral]]
