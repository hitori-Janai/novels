Chapter 22: The Might of the Divine Light [[1741 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, Lu Yang figured it out. [[1742 旁白 neutral]]
"I can't leave!" [[1743 吕阳 determined]]
This wasn't because he was moved by Xiao Shiye's final performance, but because he suddenly realized something that made his blood run cold. [[1744 旁白 fearful]]
"In the end, why did I follow Xiao Shiye out here?" [[1745 吕阳 surprised]]
"I should have gone to find Zhao Xuhe immediately to get the other half of that third-grade true technique from my past life, the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art'." [[1746 吕阳 neutral]]
But what happened instead? [[1747 旁白 neutral]]
He followed Xiao Shiye to the Merit Pool, just out of curiosity? [[1748 旁白 neutral]]
The grand prize at the Merit Pool could only be drawn once a year, and he had already used his chance. There was no benefit in going with Xiao Shiye. [[1749 旁白 neutral]]
"I actually did something with no benefit?" [[1750 吕阳 surprised]]
"This isn't logical!" [[1751 吕阳 surprised]]
In an instant, Lu Yang felt as if a basin of cold water had been poured over his head, his hands and feet turning ice-cold. "Who is influencing me? Interfering with my thoughts?" [[1752 旁白 fearful]]
"No, that's not right." [[1753 吕阳 neutral]]
After figuring this out, Lu Yang had a sudden epiphany. [[1754 旁白 neutral]]
Why did he accompany Xiao Shiye to the Merit Pool? Because Xiao Shiye needed him! Otherwise, Xiao Shiye would be the one being hunted by a powerful enemy alone right now! [[1755 旁白 neutral]]
And now, he had an external helper! [[1756 旁白 neutral]]
If Xiao Shiye was the heaven-defying Son of Destiny, then he was the unlucky fool in the stories who serves as a shield when the hero is in danger! [[1757 旁白 angry]]
Splitting up to escape in this situation? That would just attract all the fire! [[1758 旁白 angry]]
Lu Yang was one hundred percent certain that if they split up, he would be the one caught and killed, while Xiao Shiye would escape unharmed! [[1759 旁白 angry]]
"How sinister..." [[1760 吕阳 angry]]
Lu Yang let out a long breath. A Son of Destiny like Xiao Shiye playing the trick of diverting trouble would fool any disciple of the Chu Sheng Sect. [[1761 旁白 neutral]]
Because among the disciples of the Chu Sheng Sect, there are no good people. [[1762 旁白 neutral]]
If someone offered to cover the rear, any other disciple would be overjoyed, shed a few crocodile tears, and run without hesitation. [[1763 旁白 neutral]]
But as soon as they did that, they would likely become Xiao Shiye's shield. [[1764 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately for Xiao Shiye, he met Lu Yang. Xiao Shiye was certain that there were no good people in the sect, which is why he made this plan. However, Lu Yang thought the same way. [[1765 旁白 neutral]]
"No good people in the sect, so you, Xiao Shiye, are the only good one?" [[1766 吕阳 angry]]
"I don't believe it!" [[1767 吕阳 angry]]
"So, no matter how nice your words are, or how bravely you act, I'll first assume you're not a good person, and then figure out what evil things you're planning!" [[1768 吕阳 angry]]
That's right, Lu Yang reached his conclusion first! [[1769 旁白 neutral]]
Because of this, he wasn't fooled. He examined himself in time and discovered what was truly wrong. Otherwise, he would have been in deep trouble! [[1770 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Liu Xin, who had been in hot pursuit, saw Xiao Shiye charging towards him and Lu Yang standing motionless in the distance. He thought, "To catch the bandits, first catch the king. Xiao Shiye's cultivation is low, so he's easy to deal with. It's safer to take care of that Lu Yang first." [[1771 刘信 neutral]]
Before Liu Xin could finish his thought, a loud noise suddenly echoed. [[1772 旁白 neutral]]
BOOM! [[1773 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, a magnificent sword light tore through the sea of clouds. It didn't flee, but instead arrived beside Xiao Shiye under his stunned gaze. [[1774 旁白 surprised]]
"Brother Xiao, we hit it off right away. How could I, Lu, abandon you?" [[1775 吕阳 neutral]]
"They are just petty thieves. If we join forces, what is there to fear?" [[1776 吕阳 happy]]
Lu Yang spoke with heroic spirit. [[1777 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Shiye was dumbfounded. [[1778 旁白 surprised]]
Could he have miscalculated? Had he really met a good person in the sect? [[1779 萧石叶 surprised]]
"Impossible!" [[1780 萧石叶 angry]]
Xiao Shiye instantly came to his senses. He noticed that while Lu Yang seemed to be facing the enemy alongside him, he was actually positioning Xiao Shiye as a human shield. His face immediately darkened. [[1781 旁白 angry]]
What good person? This is a bad person! [[1782 萧石叶 angry]]
"Brother Lu, that was all a misunderstanding." [[1783 萧石叶 neutral]]
Xiao Shiye gave a wry smile, knowing that Lu Yang had seen through his scheme. He said softly, "Since it has come to this, why don't we truly join forces?" [[1784 萧石叶 neutral]]
"Join forces? Alright." [[1785 吕阳 neutral]]
Lu Yang sneered, then threw Xiao Shiye directly at the other enemies. Xiao Shiye immediately started cursing, "You shameless bastard, Lu!" [[1786 萧石叶 angry]]
Seeing this from a distance, Liu Xin burst out laughing. He didn't know what had happened between them, but it was clear they were fighting. This was perfect for him. He was happy to take advantage of their misfortune! [[1787 旁白 happy]]
With that in mind, Liu Xin changed his plan and shouted to the others: [[1788 旁白 neutral]]
"You all trap Xiao Shiye. I'll deal with Lu Yang." [[1789 刘信 neutral]]
After giving his orders, Liu Xin flew towards Lu Yang. But just then, he saw Lu Yang give a slight smile. [[1790 旁白 neutral]]
Something is wrong! [[1791 刘信 fearful]]
The next second, Lu Yang's figure vanished. [[1792 旁白 surprised]]
Almost at the same time, a sword light erupted from Xiao Shiye, who was already surrounded. Lu Yang's figure stepped out of the light! [[1793 旁白 surprised]]
Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art! [[1794 旁白 neutral]]
Where the sword light is, he can arrive in an instant! [[1795 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin instantly recalled their conversation. The talk of "joining forces" wasn't a joke, but a secret agreement! [[1796 旁白 surprised]]
The two of them had understood each other perfectly and even acted out a scene to trick him. They created the perfect opportunity: throwing a fully prepared Lu Yang into a group of unprepared cultivators whose highest level was only the middle stage of Qi Refining! [[1797 旁白 surprised]]
Liu Xin's expression changed dramatically. He shouted, "Spread out!" [[1798 刘信 fearful]]
"Too late!" [[1799 吕阳 angry]]
Lu Yang grinned fiercely. His sword core bloomed like a peacock's tail, but this time, the sword light was stained with a deep bloody color. [[1800 旁白 angry]]
In an instant, Lu Yang let out a shout, his body becoming a blood shadow that merged with the sword core. A crimson screen of light, like fire and blood, erupted. The divine light, with Lu Yang at its center, swept out in all directions, like a wildfire consuming a prairie, and instantly engulfed everyone! [[1801 旁白 angry]]
Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light! [[1802 旁白 neutral]]
Though it was broad daylight, the cultivators hit by the blood light felt an icy chill sweep through their bodies, and then they lost consciousness. [[1803 旁白 fearful]]
When the divine light faded, only the shaken Xiao Shiye and empty human skins drifting in the air remained. [[1804 旁白 neutral]]
Their flesh and blood had been completely devoured by the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light, making the red glow on Lu Yang's sword core look even more sinister. [[1805 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, the sword core trembled slightly, and a blood shadow emerged, taking the form of Lu Yang. [[1806 旁白 neutral]]
He looked and saw Liu Xin standing in the distance, stunned as if in a dream. Lu Yang laughed loudly, "Well, if it isn't Senior Brother Liu." [[1807 吕阳 happy]]
Before he finished speaking, he flew forward with his sword light! [[1808 旁白 angry]]
He still hadn't forgotten the grudge from being refined like a resource in his previous-previous life. He would take revenge for his past self! [[1809 旁白 angry]]
Yesterday's grudge is a thorn in my back! [[1810 旁白 angry]]
"Don't blame me for this today!" [[1811 吕阳 angry]]
Lu Yang charged with his sword. Liu Xin, having just witnessed the power of the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light, his face darkened, and he immediately tried to retreat. [[1812 旁白 neutral]]
"Trying to run?" Lu Yang pursued without hesitation. [[1813 吕阳 angry]]
Seeing this, Liu Xin quickly shouted, "Qingchen, release the barrier!" [[1814 刘信 fearful]]
As soon as he spoke, the illusion that had sealed the area shattered. A graceful figure slowly appeared; it was Fairy Qingchen. [[1815 旁白 surprised]]
The magic treasure that had covered this sea of clouds was her "Nine Palaces Dust Scarf." The scarf contained a grand formation that could trap and seal an area. It was meant to stop the target from escaping, but instead, it had blocked Liu Xin's escape route. [[1816 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Fairy Qingchen appear. [[1817 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, he flew to her side, and they stood together, looking grimly at the approaching Lu Yang and Xiao Shiye. [[1818 旁白 neutral]]
Both sides stared at each other. [[1819 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment, Liu Xin spoke in a low voice, "Hey, can we talk about this?" [[1820 刘信 fearful]]
