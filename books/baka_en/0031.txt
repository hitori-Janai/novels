Chapter 31: A Single Sword Strike to Cleave the Sky [[2427 旁白 neutral]]
A short time ago, at the summit mansion of Sky Mending Peak. [[2428 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike the rest of Sky Mending Peak, which was full of people, the summit was quiet. Only clouds moved here, far above the noisy world. [[2429 旁白 neutral]]
On a cliff, two figures were looking down at the sea of clouds below. [[2430 旁白 neutral]]
One of them had white hair but a youthful face. He wore a black and white Daoist robe and held a horsetail whisk, looking just like the kind old immortal from mortal stories. [[2431 旁白 neutral]]
The other man, who looked middle-aged, said with a teasing expression: [[2432 旁白 neutral]]
"Sky Mender, I heard you've been looking for a husband for your daughter recently?" [[2433 中年男子 neutral]]
"What? Are you interested?" The Sky Mending Peak Master turned to the middle-aged man. "If it were one of your disciples, he would be a good match for my Qian'er." [[2434 补天峰主 neutral]]
"Better not." [[2435 中年男子 neutral]]
The middle-aged man shook his head. "I know my disciples. They are all for show and no substance. They couldn't handle your daughter. You should look for someone else." [[2436 中年男子 neutral]]
"Forget it then." The Sky Mending Peak Master shook his head. "I already have someone in mind. He has trained hard for three lifetimes and has a strong foundation. He has a 30% chance of reaching the Foundation Establishment realm. Also, after learning Panlong Zhenren's 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art,' he is very powerful... in bed." [[2437 补天峰主 neutral]]
"Panlong Zhenren? That doesn't sound right." [[2438 中年男子 surprised]]
The middle-aged man did a quick calculation with his fingers, then shook his head. "Panlong Island has disappeared. Someone else has already taken the opportunity, and it wasn't one of your disciples." [[2439 中年男子 neutral]]
"He will be soon." [[2440 补天峰主 neutral]]
The Sky Mending Peak Master said calmly, "I have already figured out who stole the opportunity. I've sent Yuan Chun with some men to handle it. Things will be back to normal soon." [[2441 补天峰主 neutral]]
"Tsk, tsk. You really show no mercy." The middle-aged man shook his head. "The path to immortality is hard. Why be so harsh on the younger generation?" [[2442 中年男子 neutral]]
"You should give them a little hope now and then. After all, the Holy Sect needs new blood." [[2443 中年男子 neutral]]
"I don't need you to teach me." [[2444 补天峰主 angry]]
The Sky Mending Peak Master sneered. "If it were just that, I might not have acted. But I've calculated that the person who took Panlong Zhenren's opportunity is unusual." [[2445 补天峰主 neutral]]
As he spoke, the Peak Master's tone became more surprised. "This person has only been in the sect for a few years. He made a fortune from the substitute puppet incident, cultivated the Blood-Transforming Divine Light, forged a Sword Pellet, and mastered the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion's techniques. And he's at the sixth level of Qi Refining." [[2446 补天峰主 surprised]]
"Oh? That impressive?" [[2447 中年男子 surprised]]
The middle-aged man was surprised. He also made some calculations and then said, "I didn't expect our Holy Sect to have such a talent." [[2448 中年男子 surprised]]
After saying that, the middle-aged man was clearly interested. [[2449 旁白 neutral]]
"Come, show me where he is. Let's see what kind of talent he is. If he is good quality, maybe he can be refined into a top-grade treasure pill." [[2450 中年男子 neutral]]
"That's easy, he's right there... huh?" [[2451 补天峰主 surprised]]
The Sky Mending Peak Master was smiling, but as he pointed and looked into the distance, his smile slowly disappeared. [[2452 旁白 neutral]]
"BOOM!" [[2453 旁白 neutral]]
As the Peak Master's gaze fell, the entire Sky Mending Peak began to shake as if an earth dragon was turning over. Rocks even rolled off the edges into the sea of clouds. [[2454 旁白 neutral]]
In a mansion on Sky Mending Peak, Liu Xin lay on the ground, so scared he didn't dare to breathe, afraid of attracting the Peak Master's attention. [[2455 旁白 fearful]]
"He's not looking for me, not for me..." [[2456 刘信 fearful]]
Liu Xin desperately repeated this in his mind, trying to suppress his guilt and fear. [[2457 旁白 fearful]]
After all, that was a Foundation Establishment master. Even a glance could kill a Qi Refining cultivator, and his Myriad Souls Banner contained the master's son. [[2458 旁白 fearful]]
If discovered, he would be doomed forever! [[2459 旁白 fearful]]
"Don't be afraid. I have a divine talisman protecting me. He can't find me..." [[2460 刘信 fearful]]
Liu Xin trembled as he clutched a talisman he carried. [[2461 旁白 fearful]]
"Yuan Chun pays his respects to Master." [[2462 陆元淳 sad]]
Lu Yuanchun coughed up blood and bowed to the face in the sky to ask for forgiveness. He felt no joy at surviving, only a cold feeling in his heart. [[2463 旁白 sad]]
The jade pendant that broke Lv Yang's formation at the last moment contained a sliver of the Peak Master's divine sense. It was the greatest protection for a Foundation Establishment disciple like him. Because it was hard to make, once used, it was nearly impossible to replace. It was like one of his lives. [[2464 旁白 sad]]
And now, it was gone. [[2465 旁白 sad]]
Furthermore, not only had he failed to help Junior Brother Zhao get the opportunity back, but he also failed to protect him from an accidental death. It was a total failure. [[2466 旁白 sad]]
With all these failures, his path to immortality was now hopeless. [[2467 旁白 sad]]
"This disciple was incompetent." [[2468 陆元淳 sad]]
Lu Yuanchun dared not speak or even explain. He could only bow to the ground and wait for his master to decide his fate after killing Lv Yang. [[2469 旁白 fearful]]
Zing—! [[2470 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, Lu Yuanchun suddenly heard the sound of a sword. It was not loud, but it was clear and refreshing, impossible to ignore. [[2471 旁白 neutral]]
At first, the sound was like a gentle stream. But as time passed, the stream became a rushing river, and the sound grew louder until it was a deafening roar that echoed through the heavens and earth. [[2472 旁白 neutral]]
Lu Yuanchun subconsciously raised his head. [[2473 旁白 neutral]]
Then he saw a figure in mid-air, standing tall under the master's gaze. His back was straight, and he stared back without fear. [[2474 旁白 neutral]]
Beneath his feet was a flowing river of sword energy. [[2475 旁白 neutral]]
The river was blood-red and filled with a monstrous killing aura. But it did not spread. Instead, it shrank, flowing back into a small, exquisite Sword Pellet. [[2476 旁白 neutral]]
"What is he trying to do?" [[2477 陆元淳 surprised]]
Lu Yuanchun swallowed. He had already guessed, but he couldn't believe it. How could there be someone so bold, so ignorant of his own limits? [[2478 旁白 surprised]]
At the same time, the face in the sky seemed to realize something, and it frowned: [[2479 旁白 neutral]]
"You want to attack me?" [[2480 补天峰主 surprised]]
Lv Yang's expression was indifferent. The Sword Pellet swallowed the river of blood, its sharp edge pointing at the sky. [[2481 旁白 neutral]]
"Please enlighten me, Senior." [[2482 吕阳 neutral]]
The face said nothing, as if it was not worth a reply. [[2483 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, Lv Yang saw a black dot appear in the sky. It quickly grew larger, descending upon him with the force of the heavens. [[2484 旁白 neutral]]
When the black dot got closer, Lv Yang could finally see it clearly. It was a finger, with visible skin texture, falling from an unknown height. [[2485 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang understood instantly. This was the answer: [[2486 旁白 neutral]]
An ant cannot know the height of the heavens. [[2487 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, an intense sense of crisis swept over him, almost freezing his thoughts, like an ant that had just crawled out of its hole and suddenly saw the bright sky. [[2488 旁白 fearful]]
"You want to crush me with one finger???" [[2489 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang took a deep breath, and all the true qi in his body began to burn fiercely. He activated the Life-Killing Curse from his second life at full power. [[2490 旁白 angry]]
At this moment, he forgot about life and death. [[2491 旁白 angry]]
Lv Yang's heart was filled with only rage. [[2492 旁白 angry]]
In this life, I did not compete or fight. I focused on cultivation. But you calculated my fate, sent people to steal my opportunity, and when they failed, you came to kill me yourself. [[2493 旁白 angry]]
You talk about the cause and effect of techniques, about predetermined destinies. [[2494 旁白 angry]]
Am I destined to be a workhorse, and you destined to be high above? [[2495 吕阳 angry]]
"Kill!" [[2496 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang opened his mouth, and the true qi in his chest turned into a long cry. His rage became a sword light that shot straight into the sky. [[2497 旁白 angry]]
A silent collision, like a candle flame flickering. After a brief moment of brilliance, darkness consumed Lv Yang's vision and his consciousness. [[2498 旁白 sad]]
