Chapter 16: The Frenzied Bubble [[1288 旁白 neutral]]
With Zhao Xuhe's guarantee, Lv Yang successfully borrowed 2,000 contribution points from the "Three Rivers Society" behind him and bought Death-Substitute Yin Puppets with all of it. [[1289 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Zhao Xuhe was pacing excitedly in his cave residence. [[1290 旁白 neutral]]
"The news is actually true!" [[1291 赵旭河 happy]]
After receiving the news from his master, he was incredibly excited. "The Sect's Mass Grave in Jiangnan was actually captured by the Yushu Sword Pavilion." [[1292 赵旭河 happy]]
"The attacker was the Third Elder of the Yushu Sword Pavilion, that peerless sword cultivator known as the 'Demon-Purging Master'." [[1293 赵旭河 neutral]]
"It will be impossible to recapture it in the short term." [[1294 赵旭河 neutral]]
"With the Mass Grave lost, the price of Death-Substitute Yin Puppets is bound to rise. This is a great opportunity for us to speculate and hoard them!" [[1295 赵旭河 happy]]
"I'm going to be rich!" [[1296 赵旭河 happy]]
As a deacon disciple at the Merit Hall in the Chu Sheng Sect, Zhao Xuhe certainly didn't lack background, connections, foresight, or greed. As soon as he confirmed Lv Yang's news was true, he immediately started raising money and invested all his available funds into Death-Substitute Yin Puppets. [[1297 旁白 neutral]]
And events unfolded just as he expected. [[1298 旁白 neutral]]
As news of the Jiangnan Mass Grave incident spread, more and more people who "sensed a business opportunity" began to buy up Death-Substitute Yin Puppets from the market at high prices. [[1299 旁白 neutral]]
Just like in any speculative bubble, the first people to enter the market made a lot of money. [[1300 旁白 neutral]]
However, as the situation developed, everyone discovered that the price of Death-Substitute Yin Puppets showed no signs of decreasing. The buying price was high, and the selling price was even higher. [[1301 旁白 neutral]]
Making money suddenly became easy. [[1302 旁白 neutral]]
Just by buying and selling, one could easily earn contribution points that would have previously required completing several, or even dozens, of sect missions. [[1303 旁白 neutral]]
And so, more people went into a frenzy. [[1304 旁白 neutral]]
More and more people began to invest their savings, hoping to make money. And they did, which stimulated the market even further. [[1305 旁白 neutral]]
Even the more cautious people felt upset when they saw fellow disciples they usually looked down on earning more money than them simply by buying something, waiting a few days, and selling it. So, they naturally joined the wave too. [[1306 旁白 neutral]]
In this wave, the price of Death-Substitute Yin Puppets soared. [[1307 旁白 neutral]]
From the initial 200 contribution points, it climbed to 300. A fifty percent price increase drove countless speculators into a greater frenzy. [[1308 旁白 neutral]]
After all, its price didn't stop; it was still rising. [[1309 旁白 neutral]]
It's rising today, so it will definitely rise tomorrow. If it rises tomorrow, why wouldn't it keep rising the day after? Not buying now is a loss! [[1310 旁白 neutral]]
So, more and more people rushed to get in on the action. [[1311 旁白 neutral]]
300, 400, 500... Finally, when the price soared to 500 contribution points, people's reason returned, and they felt it was about enough. [[1312 旁白 neutral]]
"Time to sell!" [[1313 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe was the first to seize this delicate moment. He began secretly selling off the Death-Substitute Yin Puppets he had hoarded in batches, preparing to cash out and exit the market. [[1314 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the price in the entire Death-Substitute Yin Puppet market began to fall. [[1315 旁白 neutral]]
After all, Zhao Xuhe wasn't the only smart person in the world. Others also keenly noticed the downward trend and began to gradually sell off their stock. [[1316 旁白 neutral]]
If things had continued this way, the price would have crashed completely and returned to normal within a few days. [[1317 旁白 neutral]]
However, just as this wave was about to subside, a piece of news suddenly spread throughout the entire Chu Sheng Sect overnight from the upper echelons. [[1318 旁白 neutral]]
"The Sect is preparing to counterattack!" [[1319 旁白 neutral]]
"The loss of the Mass Grave in Jiangnan has angered a True Master, who has decided to personally take action, gather disciples, and fight the Yushu Sword Pavilion!" [[1320 旁白 neutral]]
"A great war is coming!" [[1321 旁白 neutral]]
In times of war, the prices of all war-related supplies were bound to rise. [[1322 旁白 neutral]]
And how important was a Death-Substitute Yin Puppet, an item that could save a life at a critical moment, in the bloody and brutal righteous-demonic war to come? [[1323 旁白 neutral]]
It was like a second life! [[1324 旁白 neutral]]
Without a doubt, on the very night this news spread, the price of Death-Substitute Yin Puppets, which had already begun to fall, experienced a second surge! [[1325 旁白 neutral]]
Not only did it instantly return to its peak of 500 contribution points, but it was still climbing! [[1326 旁白 neutral]]
By the next morning, 500 contribution points had become 1,000, a fivefold increase from the original price of 200! [[1327 旁白 neutral]]
"Hahahahaha!" [[1328 王柏荣 happy]]
In the Library Pavilion, Wang Borong stood on his precious rocking chair, dancing with excitement, his old face flushed with a feverish enthusiasm. [[1329 旁白 happy]]
"Rise! Keep rising for me!" [[1330 王柏荣 happy]]
"No, I have to buy more. Selling what I have now won't make much. I need to hoard more, and I'll have enough for a cave residence!" [[1331 王柏荣 happy]]
At this moment, a carnival for ordinary disciples erupted throughout the entire Sect. [[1332 旁白 neutral]]
These ordinary disciples lacked foresight, connections, and information channels, so they were still buying when others were secretly selling. [[1333 旁白 neutral]]
And now, they had struck it rich. [[1334 旁白 neutral]]
Countless ordinary disciples saw their wealth double overnight, earning more than the total assets of some senior disciples with backgrounds and connections. [[1335 旁白 neutral]]
For a time, countless unbelievable stories spread throughout the Sect. [[1336 旁白 neutral]]
For example, a poor boy, publicly shamed by his fiancée who broke off their engagement, furiously broke it off with her after his wealth doubled, leaving behind the words, "Don't bully a young man for being poor..." [[1337 旁白 neutral]]
Or a little girl who had to live under someone else's roof after her father died and her mother remarried. Before buying the puppets, she was beaten and scolded by her stepmother daily and couldn't even protect her father's inheritance. Now, with her wealth doubled, she immediately bought a high-class cave residence in full. [[1338 旁白 neutral]]
Do you have a dream? Do you want to achieve it? [[1339 旁白 neutral]]
Come and buy Death-Substitute Yin Puppets! [[1340 旁白 neutral]]
This frenzy, where everyone was involved, reached its absolute peak one day when a disciple at the peak of Qi Refinement suddenly broke through and successfully achieved Foundation Establishment. [[1341 旁白 neutral]]
Because that disciple publicly admitted that his breakthrough was entirely due to earning enough contribution points by trading Death-Substitute Yin Puppets to buy a Foundation Establishment Pill. He had to thank the puppets; without them, he could never have changed his destiny... [[1342 旁白 neutral]]
Complete madness. [[1343 旁白 neutral]]
1,000, 2,000, 3,000... The price of Death-Substitute Yin Puppets skyrocketed, and as the price soared, some were happy, while others were naturally sad. [[1344 旁白 neutral]]
Among the happy ones was Lv Yang. [[1345 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't hesitate, choosing to sell decisively when the price hit 2,000. [[1346 旁白 neutral]]
After all, buying 10 for 200 contribution points each and selling them for 2,000 was a tenfold profit, bringing in 20,000 contribution points! [[1347 旁白 happy]]
Among the sad ones was Zhao Xuhe. [[1348 旁白 neutral]]
When he saw the price rebound, he was green with regret, especially after seeing Wang Borong, whom he had previously looked down on and even planned to swindle. [[1349 旁白 sad]]
As far as he knew, Wang Borong, a man who had been mediocre for decades and was halfway to the grave, had hoarded more than 20 Death-Substitute Yin Puppets, all bought at high prices during this period. When he was secretly selling his own, he had mocked Wang Borong as a leek waiting to be harvested. [[1350 旁白 neutral]]
But now, that damn guy was about to earn 100,000 contribution points! [[1351 旁白 angry]]
If it were just that he himself hadn't earned it, that would have been one thing. [[1352 旁白 neutral]]
But seeing Wang Borong earn so many contribution points, grinning from ear to ear every day, felt even worse than losing money himself! [[1353 旁白 angry]]
And after watching the price of the Death-Substitute Yin Puppets rise relentlessly without stopping, Zhao Xuhe thought it over and hesitated for a whole night. [[1354 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, he re-entered the market. [[1355 旁白 neutral]]
He threw the contribution points he had earned from cashing out earlier back into the Death-Substitute Yin Puppet market. [[1356 旁白 neutral]]
At first, he remained cautious and didn't invest all his points, but as he watched the price keep rising, he felt like he was losing out with every point it went up. [[1357 旁白 neutral]]
"Opportunity knocks but once. I've already missed it once, how can I miss it a second time?" [[1358 赵旭河 fearful]]
"It will keep rising. Buying now is better than buying later." [[1359 赵旭河 fearful]]
There were many others who thought the same as Zhao Xuhe. [[1360 旁白 neutral]]
And when this group of people, who had been the first to cash out, re-entered the market, it stimulated the price of Death-Substitute Yin Puppets to rise even further, strengthening people's confidence. [[1361 旁白 neutral]]
