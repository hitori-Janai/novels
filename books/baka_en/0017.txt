Chapter 17: Others are Fearful, I'm Buying More [[1363 旁白 neutral]]
Actually, Zhao Xuhe also knew that the Death Substitute Puppet had become a complete bubble, ready to burst and crash at any moment. [[1364 旁白 neutral]]
But he believed that with his sharp senses, he could definitely exit the market in time. [[1365 旁白 neutral]]
So when Lv Yang contacted him, saying he had already sold his puppets and wanted to repay the 2000 Contribution Point loan, Zhao Xuhe felt it was a pity. [[1366 旁白 neutral]]
"Reckless, Junior Brother, you are too reckless!" [[1367 赵旭河 surprised]]
"Haven't you seen that the price of the Death Substitute Puppet is still rising? The war hasn't even started yet. When it really begins, the demand will truly be greater than the supply!" [[1368 赵旭河 surprised]]
"While the price hasn't risen too much, I suggest you buy them back quickly." [[1369 赵旭河 neutral]]
Faced with Zhao Xuhe's strong persuasion, Lv Yang remained rational. [[1370 旁白 neutral]]
Although he was also envious of the soaring price of the puppets and even regretted selling so early, he understood Zhao Xuhe's real reason for persuading him. [[1371 旁白 neutral]]
"Caring about me?" [[1372 吕阳 neutral]]
"Don't be foolish. He wants to pull more people into the market!" [[1373 吕阳 neutral]]
After all, the more people who entered the market, the better his chances were to cash out and leave. [[1374 旁白 neutral]]
"I need to hold back. I'm not in a hurry." [[1375 吕阳 neutral]]
"In this life, I'll observe the situation first and confirm the highest price point. In the next life, I will repeat the process. That will be my real chance to make a fortune." [[1376 吕阳 neutral]]
"With the 'Hundred Lives Book', I will only profit and never lose!" [[1377 吕阳 happy]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang's mood instantly calmed down. He directly settled the loan with Zhao Xuhe and then went into seclusion, ignoring the outside world. [[1378 旁白 neutral]]
While Lv Yang was in seclusion, the price of the Death Substitute Puppet continued to soar. [[1379 旁白 neutral]]
Because the Chu Sheng Sect had really started preparing for war! [[1380 旁白 neutral]]
A large number of disciples received orders and left the sect one after another, their destinations unknown. In this situation, the price of the puppets naturally couldn't fall at all. [[1381 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how expensive, those who were about to go to the great war between sects had to grit their teeth and buy them. [[1382 旁白 neutral]]
After all, money could be earned again, but they only had one life. [[1383 旁白 neutral]]
Under these circumstances, more and more people chose to enter the market. Most of them were not ordinary disciples, but disciples from prominent families. [[1384 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to ordinary disciples, these family disciples came from wealthy backgrounds. Their elders were at least at the Foundation Establishment realm, so they had far more Contribution Points to use. After they entered the market, the price of the puppets, which had been slowing down, took off again. [[1385 旁白 neutral]]
Three thousand, four thousand, five thousand... [[1386 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, this price was no longer on the same level as the puppet's actual value. Some people even began to leave the market out of fear. [[1387 旁白 neutral]]
In this situation, the price of the Death Substitute Puppet naturally began to fall. [[1388 旁白 neutral]]
A similar panic gradually spread, but many people, especially those who had experienced the first dip, remained full of confidence. [[1389 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't panic, this is just a technical correction!" [[1390 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Selling off? It's still too early!" [[1391 陌生男2 neutral]]
This time, Zhao Xuhe felt he had learned his lesson. [[1392 旁白 neutral]]
He had left the market early before, and when he re-entered, he not only didn't make a profit but also suffered a small loss. How could he make the same mistake twice? [[1393 旁白 neutral]]
"The war between sects hasn't started yet, and the supply of puppets in the market is still plentiful, so it seems like the price has peaked. But once the war begins, the puppets will be consumed in large numbers, and there are no replacements. Everyone will have to come back and buy them!" [[1394 赵旭河 neutral]]
"At that time, the price will surely see a third surge!" [[1395 赵旭河 happy]]
"What's a mere five thousand Contribution Points? Seven thousand, or even ten thousand is possible! It will be a seller's market. It's a matter of life and death, so everyone will sell everything they have to buy one!" [[1396 赵旭河 happy]]
Zhao Xuhe felt his analysis was absolutely flawless. [[1397 旁白 neutral]]
"So, while those fools are selling out of fear... I'm going to buy more!" [[1398 赵旭河 happy]]
Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe not only invested all his savings, but he also took out a large loan based on the reputation of the Three Rivers Association. [[1399 旁白 neutral]]
He went all in. [[1400 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, Zhao Xuhe wasn't the only "smart one." Others made the same judgment and began to buy up everything on the market. [[1401 旁白 neutral]]
Influenced by this, the price, which had just fallen, began to rise again. [[1402 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe, who had been a little uncertain, felt reassured, thinking his decision to go all in was truly wise. [[1403 旁白 happy]]
Then, early the next morning. [[1404 旁白 neutral]]
A voice came directly from the Holy Fire Cliff, instantly spreading throughout the Chu Sheng Sect. [[1405 旁白 neutral]]
"Recently, the Sect Master personally made arrangements. On the surface, he gathered disciples in a posture of war, but secretly, he sent people to raid the Jiangnan Mass Grave." [[1406 旁白 neutral]]
"Therefore, I am pleased to announce to all disciples." [[1407 旁白 neutral]]
"As of yesterday, the Jiangnan Mass Grave has been reclaimed by the Sect Master himself. At the same time, the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion has contacted the Sect Master, willing to negotiate for peace with our sect." [[1408 旁白 neutral]]
It exploded. [[1409 旁白 neutral]]
Literally. The moment the news spread, an explosion was heard from a certain disciple's cave, as if someone had self-destructed from a cultivation deviation. [[1410 旁白 fearful]]
Then, there was complete silence. [[1411 旁白 fearful]]
The vast Chu Sheng Sect, which was full of life and ambition yesterday, was now filled with a terrifying, suffocating silence. [[1412 旁白 fearful]]
Because everyone understood that retaking the Jiangnan Mass Grave meant the shortage of Death Substitute Puppets was over. The Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion's offer of peace talks meant the great war between sects was a long way off. More importantly, this news was released through the disciple tokens, making it an official announcement. [[1413 旁白 neutral]]
So it could not be false. [[1414 旁白 neutral]]
The bubble named Death Substitute Puppet burst at this moment. As a result, its price plummeted from a peak of seven thousand. [[1415 旁白 neutral]]
Five thousand, three thousand, one thousand, two hundred. [[1416 旁白 neutral]]
The price, which had taken more than a month to rise, now crashed back to its original value in just a quarter of an hour, and it was still falling! [[1417 旁白 fearful]]
Everyone wanted to sell, but no one was willing to buy. [[1418 旁白 fearful]]
Especially those who had hoarded a large number of puppets could only watch as the price dropped below rock bottom, their wealth evaporating. [[1419 旁白 fearful]]
Bang! Bang! Bang! [[1420 旁白 fearful]]
That night, deafening explosions echoed through the Chu Sheng Sect from time to time. It was unknown how many people's Dao hearts were shattered because of this. [[1421 旁白 fearful]]
In his cave, Zhao Xuhe had already fainted. [[1422 旁白 neutral]]
When he opened his eyes again, he still looked dazed, as if in a dream: "What a terrible dream. I actually dreamed that the price of the Death Substitute Puppet crashed... hahaha." [[1423 赵旭河 fearful]]
Then he glanced at the price of the Death Substitute Puppet again. [[1424 旁白 neutral]]
100 Contribution Points each. [[1425 旁白 neutral]]
"...I must have seen it wrong." [[1426 赵旭河 fearful]]
After a moment of silence, Zhao Xuhe closed the disciple token, took a deep breath, and opened it again with a trembling hand to check the price. [[1427 旁白 neutral]]
50 Contribution Points each. [[1428 旁白 neutral]]
"Pfft!!!" [[1429 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe spat out a mouthful of old blood on the spot. His face turned livid, and his aura dropped to rock bottom, just like the price of the puppets. [[1430 旁白 neutral]]
"I hate this...!" [[1431 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe didn't have time to think. He desperately suppressed the rampaging thoughts in his mind, circulated his energy, and sorted out his True Qi, barely avoiding a true cultivation deviation. [[1432 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a voice came from outside his cave. [[1433 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Zhao, Lv Yang is here to visit." [[1434 吕阳 neutral]]
"Lv Yang?" [[1435 赵旭河 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe was stunned for a long time before he remembered his junior brother. Thinking about how the other party had left the market early and paid off his loan, while he himself was now completely ruined... [[1436 旁白 sad]]
"Pfft!" [[1437 赵旭河 sad]]
Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, Zhao Xuhe staggered out of the door and saw Lv Yang standing there, looking refreshed and waving at him enthusiastically: [[1438 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, how much money did you make today?" [[1439 吕阳 happy]]
Bang! [[1440 旁白 angry]]
With a loud noise, Zhao Xuhe gritted his teeth, and his whole body showed signs of rampaging True Qi, with cracks appearing on his skin and trickles of blood seeping out. [[1441 旁白 angry]]
Lv Yang immediately looked horrified: "Senior Brother!? Are you alright?" [[1442 吕阳 fearful]]
"...I'm fine." [[1443 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe forced a smile: "By the way, Junior Brother Lv, I recently discovered a predecessor's cave. It seems to have a lot of good things inside." [[1444 赵旭河 angry]]
As his voice fell, a fierce light appeared in Zhao Xuhe's eyes, and he squeezed out the words through his teeth: "I wonder if Junior Brother is interested?" [[1445 赵旭河 angry]]
