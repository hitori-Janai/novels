Chapter 39: Enemy Attack [[3037 旁白 neutral]]
"Lu Yuanchun! You bastard!" [[3038 飞霞仙子 angry]]
Seeing the market's grand formation breached, Fairy Feixia was furious. But then, she did the exact opposite of what Lu Yuanchun did. [[3039 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, let's team up!" [[3040 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
In a flash of light, Fairy Feixia landed in the market. She then turned to defend the breach in the formation, saying, "We absolutely cannot let the Shenwu Sect get inside." [[3041 飞霞仙子 angry]]
Lv Yang glanced at Fairy Feixia and his opinion of her changed. She had blood on her lips and her energy was weak, clearly she was badly injured. If she had run with Lu Yuanchun, she might have had a chance to escape. Yet, she chose to stay and defend the market. [[3042 旁白 neutral]]
Could she be a traitor? [[3043 吕阳 neutral]]
Believing that there were no good people in the Chu Sheng Sect, Lv Yang immediately suspected Fairy Feixia. She also noticed his wary gaze. [[3044 旁白 neutral]]
"We can't escape!" [[3045 飞霞仙子 sad]]
Fairy Feixia sighed, having guessed Lv Yang's thoughts. She said in a low voice, "The Shenwu Sect has been planning this for a long time. Trying to escape is a dead end." [[3046 飞霞仙子 sad]]
"Our only chance of survival is to stay here, defend, and wait for reinforcements!" [[3047 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
Lv Yang was still doubtful. "Senior Sister, you understand this, so how could Senior Brother Lu not know? If so, why did he run?" [[3048 吕阳 neutral]]
"Because he has the precious jade!" [[3049 飞霞仙子 angry]]
At this point, Fairy Feixia became furious. "The Shenwu Sect used that Profound Yin Treasure Jade as bait to set an ambush. But Lu Yuanchun coveted the jade and took it by force. He not only dragged us into the trap with him, but he also ignored Senior Brother Chen's fate and abandoned us to escape by himself!" [[3050 飞霞仙子 angry]]
"So, he's fleeing to escape punishment?" [[3051 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang understood. Lu Yuanchun knew what he did was wrong. If he stayed in the market, Fairy Feixia would eventually make him pay. [[3052 旁白 neutral]]
That's why he chose such an extreme measure. [[3053 旁白 neutral]]
It also made sense why Fairy Feixia didn't run with Lu Yuanchun. If she had, he might have killed her to silence her. [[3054 旁白 neutral]]
"Demons, today you will die!" [[3055 陌生男1 angry]]
A brilliant aura of blood and energy lit up the sky, like fiery clouds rolling in. Finally, a muscular man in armor appeared, his expression fierce. [[3056 旁白 neutral]]
"It's 'Divine Fist' Wu Zhichong!" [[3057 飞霞仙子 fearful]]
Fairy Feixia's face was serious. She whispered, "He is at the ninth level of Qi Refining, only one step away from the Great Perfection stage. Junior Brother, be very careful." [[3058 飞霞仙子 fearful]]
"Senior Brother Chen died because he was hit by his punch, his body was completely destroyed." [[3059 飞霞仙子 sad]]
Before Fairy Feixia could finish, the man named Wu Zhichong was already speeding towards them. He raised his arm high above his head, pulling it back like a bow. [[3060 旁白 neutral]]
"Die!" [[3061 吴志冲 angry]]
The next moment, he threw a punch! [[3062 旁白 neutral]]
A piercing sonic boom echoed in all directions. The square fist imprint shot forward, and for a moment, Lv Yang felt a mountain crushing down on him! [[3063 旁白 fearful]]
Boom! [[3064 旁白 neutral]]
At the critical moment, Fairy Feixia stepped forward. Her cloud-like sleeves fluttered, and she released clusters of glowing clouds surrounded by clear energy to block Wu Zhichong's punch. [[3065 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, the colorful misty clouds exploded, managing to stop Wu Zhichong outside the market. However, the clouds lost most of their treasured light. [[3066 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, a flash of pain crossed Fairy Feixia's eyes. [[3067 旁白 neutral]]
This Rosy-Cloud Mist was one of her magic treasures, the "Rosy-Cloud Mist Shroud." She had spent many years refining it, but now it had been damaged repeatedly. [[3068 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, another streak of light descended from the sky. [[3069 旁白 neutral]]
When the figure appeared, it was Lu Yuanchun, who had just fled. His face was extremely pale, and another cultivator was following close behind him. [[3070 旁白 neutral]]
"'Mountain-Moving Daoist' Duanmu Yuan." [[3071 飞霞仙子 surprised]]
Fairy Feixia frowned, recognizing the person blocking Lu Yuanchun. It was another late-stage Qi Refining expert from the Shenwu Sect, just as strong as her. [[3072 旁白 neutral]]
"Lu Yuanchun, if you want to live, come back and fight with me!" [[3073 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia said in a serious tone. Although the Shenwu Sect's attack was fierce, she felt they still had a chance with three late-stage Qi Refining cultivators on their side. [[3074 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Lv Yang was just an ordinary disciple, he could handle early and mid-stage cultivators. If she and Lu Yuanchun could hold off Wu Zhichong and the Mountain-Moving Daoist, Lv Yang could deal with the other Shenwu Sect disciples. They might have a chance to defend the market! [[3075 旁白 neutral]]
"...Fine! Let's fight for our lives. Buy me some time!" [[3076 陆元淳 neutral]]
As he spoke, Lu Yuanchun took a deep breath and burned his blood essence. A bloody light erupted from the top of his head, and his power instantly surged. [[3077 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Fairy Feixia finally felt a sense of relief. [[3078 旁白 neutral]]
'He is a disciple of the Sky Mending Peak Master, after all. He must have some powerful techniques. With my help, we should be able to defend the market.' [[3079 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
With that thought, Fairy Feixia no longer held back. She once again summoned the "Rosy-Cloud Mist Shroud" to buy more time. [[3080 旁白 neutral]]
"Stop him!" [[3081 吴志冲 angry]]
Although Wu Zhichong didn't know what Lu Yuanchun's technique was, he couldn't let him use it. He immediately flew towards Lu Yuanchun to attack. [[3082 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Fairy Feixia pushed her true qi to its limit to block the other late-stage expert, Duanmu Yuan. She shouted to Lv Yang, "Junior Brother Lv, now! If we can stop Wu Zhichong, we can still turn this around." [[3083 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
"Lv Yang? An ordinary disciple... What good is he, even if he broke through to the late stage?" [[3084 陆元淳 neutral]]
Lu Yuanchun glanced at Lv Yang with a cold sneer in his heart. [[3085 旁白 neutral]]
In his eyes, Lv Yang was just a nobody who got lucky. He couldn't compare to a Foundation Establishment disciple like himself. [[3086 旁白 neutral]]
This thought made him even more determined. [[3087 旁白 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia thought they had a chance, but Lu Yuanchun disagreed. He believed she was overlooking a decisive factor. [[3088 旁白 neutral]]
The corpse tide! [[3089 旁白 neutral]]
Even if they could hold off the Shenwu Sect, as long as the breach in the formation was open, they would all be wiped out when the corpse tide arrived! [[3090 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, in the next moment, Lu Yuanchun made his move. [[3091 旁白 neutral]]
"Witness my divine power!" [[3092 陆元淳 neutral]]
Hearing this, Fairy Feixia's spirits lifted. She watched as the blood-red light around Lu Yuanchun condensed, forming a ferocious and magnificent demonic shadow. [[3093 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't expect Lu Yuanchun to kill Wu Zhichong, but if he could just injure him badly, there would be hope. [[3094 旁白 neutral]]
"Blood Shadow Heaven Escape Technique!" [[3095 陆元淳 neutral]]
The demonic shadow flashed, and Lu Yuanchun's figure vanished. He reappeared as a streak of blood-red light hundreds of meters away, speeding out of Skeleton Mountain. [[3096 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, Fairy Feixia was stunned. [[3097 旁白 surprised]]
She had clearly underestimated how shameless Lu Yuanchun was. She never imagined he would pretend to cooperate while actually using her as a shield. [[3098 旁白 angry]]
But just then, the sky outside Skeleton Mountain suddenly darkened. [[3099 旁白 neutral]]
"Trying to leave? You should stay!" [[3100 陌生男2 angry]]
With a cold laugh, the streak of blood-red light that was Lu Yuanchun was cut off. He was forced back to Skeleton Mountain, letting out a terrified scream. [[3101 旁白 neutral]]
"Great Perfection of Qi Refining!?" [[3102 陆元淳 fearful]]
He had burned half his blood essence to use that escape technique. No one in the late Qi Refining stage could have stopped him. Only a Great Perfection expert could! [[3103 旁白 fearful]]
"The heavens want me dead." [[3104 陆元淳 sad]]
Lu Yuanchun's heart was filled with bitterness. He had finally gotten the Profound Yin Treasure Jade. If he had escaped, the Sky Mending Peak Master would have surely valued him. [[3105 旁白 sad]]
This was his great chance, especially since Zhao Xuhe had been abandoned by the Peak Master! [[3106 旁白 neutral]]
But now, it was all for nothing. [[3107 旁白 sad]]
Just then, Lu Yuanchun suddenly heard Lv Yang's voice in his ear. "Senior Brother Lu, come back to the market first." [[3108 吕阳 neutral]]
"What's the point now?" [[3109 陆元淳 sad]]
Lu Yuanchun was in despair. He had no interest in replying to Lv Yang. As he saw it, the only difference between them now was who would die first. [[3110 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, Lv Yang, who had been silent, suddenly stepped forward. With a wave of his large sleeves and a flick of his ten fingers, he instantly cast dozens of formation patterns around the market. These patterns broke the small array the Shenwu Sect had used to keep the formation's breach open. Then, he controlled the main formation and closed it. [[3111 旁白 neutral]]
Boom! [[3112 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, dense formation patterns appeared, forming a curtain of light that covered the inside and outside of the market. The grand formation was restored and complete again! [[3113 旁白 neutral]]
"...Huh?" [[3114 陆元淳 surprised]]
Lu Yuanchun's eyes widened in shock. Then, with a jolt, he quickly flew his blood-red light back into the market, shouting, "Brother Lv, save me!!!" [[3115 陆元淳 fearful]]
