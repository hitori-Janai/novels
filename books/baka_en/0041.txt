Chapter 41: A Fierce Battle [[3190 旁白 neutral]]
"Demon, do you really think you can be so fearless with just a seventh-grade grand array?" [[3191 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Ouyang Haoze sneered at Lv Yang through the array's light screen, "An array is a dead thing. For cultivators like us, our cultivation level is what truly matters!" [[3192 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
"In the end, only a real fight will decide things." [[3193 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Lv Yang was on high alert, but his face remained calm. "Fellow Daoist, if you are so confident, feel free to enter the array for a fight. Otherwise, you should just retreat." [[3194 吕阳 neutral]]
"You are looking for death!" [[3195 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Ouyang Haoze gave a cold smile and actually took a step forward. He then let out a breath, and with a sound like thunder, a powerful voice burst from his throat. [[3196 旁白 neutral]]
This was a high-level divine ability from the Divine Martial Sect called the "Thousand-Mile Void-Shattering Divine Sound." It used a secret method to absorb spiritual energy, enhance it with the sect's special third-grade "Divine Martial True Qi," and then release it in a single roar. The sound wave would turn everything within a thousand miles to dust, friend or foe alike. [[3197 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, the powerful divine sound rushed into the array. [[3198 旁白 neutral]]
The array's patterns shattered, revealing skeleton soldiers of different shapes. A gap was forcefully blown into the massive array! [[3199 旁白 neutral]]
Next, Ouyang Haoze took out a round mirror. [[3200 旁白 neutral]]
"Please, Master Taixiao, take action." [[3201 欧阳昊泽 neutral]]
He formed a hand seal and pointed, sending the mirror into the air. A magnificent beam of light shot down, freezing the space and holding the gap in the array open! [[3202 旁白 neutral]]
In that moment, the marketplace shook violently! [[3203 旁白 neutral]]
Many cultivators quickly moved back, not daring to get close to the edge of the array, their faces filled with panic. [[3204 旁白 fearful]]
Fairy Feixia's face was pale. The next second, she suddenly looked at Lu Yuanchun, who had a strange expression, and shouted, "Stay here! Don't you go anywhere!" [[3205 飞霞仙子 angry]]
After being tricked by him before, Fairy Feixia no longer trusted Lu Yuanchun. Her beautiful face now looked fierce, "If it weren't for Junior Brother Lv, you would already be dead outside the marketplace. If you dare to run away during this chaos, I will kill you first, no matter the cost!" [[3206 飞霞仙子 angry]]
"Junior Sister Feixia, you have misunderstood..." [[3207 陆元淳 fearful]]
Lu Yuanchun gave an awkward smile. Seeing Fairy Feixia's murderous look, he felt a bit scared and suppressed the treacherous thoughts that had just appeared in his mind. [[3208 旁白 neutral]]
With the two late-stage Qi Refining cultivators keeping order, the chaos in the marketplace quickly calmed down. [[3209 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, everyone knew this was only temporary. [[3210 旁白 neutral]]
The outcome of the fight between Lv Yang and Ouyang Haoze was the final straw. Therefore, Fairy Feixia could only put her trust in Lv Yang now. [[3211 旁白 neutral]]
Believing he could create a miracle. [[3212 旁白 neutral]]
"Is this... a spiritual treasure?" [[3213 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang's face changed drastically as he looked at the mirror in the air, "And it's a supreme yang spiritual treasure that suppresses earthly demonic qi, specifically made to counter the 'Grand Array of a Hundred Skeletons'!?" [[3214 吕阳 fearful]]
Ouyang Haoze laughed loudly, looking very pleased with himself: [[3215 旁白 happy]]
"The Grand Array of a Hundred Skeletons has stood on Skeleton Mountain for many years. Since my Divine Martial Sect dared to make a move, how could we not prepare a way to break it in advance?" [[3216 欧阳昊泽 happy]]
"With the 'Taixiao Mirror' here, you will definitely die today!" [[3217 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
This spiritual treasure was not his. It was specially crafted by a Foundation Establishment master from the Divine Martial Sect to deal with the Grand Array of a Hundred Skeletons, so its power was obvious. [[3218 旁白 neutral]]
Above the marketplace, Lv Yang looked grim. Without a word, he turned and fled. [[3219 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmph! Trying to escape?" [[3220 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Without thinking, Ouyang Haoze leaped up, unleashing his divine sound again to instantly shatter the surrounding skeleton soldiers, and then chased after Lv Yang. [[3221 旁白 neutral]]
But just then, something unexpected happened! [[3222 旁白 neutral]]
The moment Ouyang Haoze stepped into the array, his expression changed. He subconsciously tried to retreat, but when he turned around, he only saw a screen of scarlet array patterns. [[3223 旁白 neutral]]
"I didn't expect you to actually dare to come in." [[3224 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang stopped running and turned to look at Ouyang Haoze. The panic from before was gone, replaced by a cold smile. [[3225 旁白 neutral]]
"This is impossible!" [[3226 欧阳昊泽 surprised]]
Ouyang Haoze's eye twitched with disbelief, "The Grand Array of a Hundred Skeletons was clearly fixed in place by my Taixiao Mirror. Why is there another array appearing? Is there a second array in the marketplace? Where did it come from? Why didn't I notice any signs of it being set up beforehand?" [[3227 欧阳昊泽 fearful]]
"Because I don't need to set up an array at all." [[3228 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang sneered internally. His Blood River Sword Formation was completely dependent on the Blood Sun Sword Pellet, his formation treasure. The array formed with a single thought, so of course there would be no traces! [[3229 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, a large banner appeared in Lv Yang's hand, waving in the wind. [[3230 旁白 neutral]]
The Innate Qi Ten Thousand Spirits Banner! [[3231 旁白 neutral]]
As the banner waved, spirits flew out and landed on the key points of the Blood River Sword Formation, moving on their own. [[3232 旁白 neutral]]
When designing this formation, Lv Yang had already considered the Innate Qi Ten Thousand Spirits Banner. Now, the ten thousand souls in the banner spread out, occupying the formation's key points and revealing its power. In an instant, the sky turned red, and a massive river of blood flowed from south to north, crashing down on Ouyang Haoze! [[3233 旁白 neutral]]
Ouyang Haoze grunted and staggered. [[3234 旁白 neutral]]
Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light! [[3235 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the array, Ouyang Haoze couldn't dodge the divine light's power. He felt his vast lifeblood rapidly draining from his body like a bursting dam. [[3236 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, he quickly shouted, "Lord Heavenly Light, save me!" [[3237 欧阳昊泽 fearful]]
Golden light shone like the sun on armor scales. Layers of protective light covered Ouyang Haoze, and for a moment, it actually stopped the Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light from consuming him. [[3238 旁白 neutral]]
Spiritual treasure, Heavenly Light Armor! [[3239 旁白 neutral]]
This treasure was made from "Demon-Subduing Heavenly Light," which directly countered the Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light. When the two clashed, they canceled each other out. [[3240 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did Ouyang Haoze breathe a sigh of relief. [[3241 旁白 neutral]]
After all, he never expected that even with his high cultivation level and two spiritual treasures, the Taixiao Mirror and the Heavenly Light Armor, he would still almost fail. [[3242 旁白 neutral]]
"I can't run now." [[3243 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Ouyang Haoze's eyes were bloodshot. Instead of trying to escape, he looked at Lv Yang deep within the array, his eyes filled with a suffocating killing intent. [[3244 旁白 angry]]
"...The only way is to counterattack!" [[3245 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
As a true disciple of his sect, his will was strong. He knew that in a desperate situation, the brave one wins. If he tried to run, Lv Yang would slowly trap and kill him. To break the array, he had to find life in death and try to kill Lv Yang. If Lv Yang died, the array would break on its own! [[3246 旁白 neutral]]
Boom! [[3247 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, protected by the Heavenly Light Armor, Ouyang Haoze charged at Lv Yang, his spear aimed straight at the Innate Qi Ten Thousand Spirits Banner in Lv Yang's hand! [[3248 旁白 neutral]]
"That banner seems to be the core of this array. If I can't kill Lv Yang, destroying it might be a way to survive." [[3249 欧阳昊泽 neutral]]
"Well timed!" [[3250 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang waved his banner, and a figure appeared. It was Liu Xin. His face was full of confusion, as if he hadn't fully woken up yet. [[3251 旁白 neutral]]
The next second— [[3252 旁白 neutral]]
"Explode!" [[3253 吕阳 angry]]
With a huge explosion, Liu Xin opened his mouth and shouted the word "kill." It was a death curse designed for mutual destruction! [[3254 旁白 neutral]]
In Lv Yang's opinion, Liu Xin's use of the Innate Qi Ten Thousand Spirits Banner was too basic. The banner spirits were immortal. Even if they were destroyed, as long as their true spirit was not scattered, they could be summoned again by using magical power. So, why let them fight normally? [[3255 旁白 neutral]]
They should learn suicide attacks! [[3256 旁白 neutral]]
Since they could be revived, letting them use powerful abilities that would kill a thousand enemies at the cost of eight hundred of their own, self-destructing to kill the enemy, was the right way to use them! [[3257 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, a wave of spiritual energy consumed everything. [[3258 旁白 neutral]]
When the dust settled, Liu Xin was gone. Ouyang Haoze was stopped in mid-air, his expression extremely grim. [[3259 旁白 neutral]]
So far, he had used many methods. [[3260 旁白 neutral]]
Divine abilities, spiritual treasures, and his higher cultivation level should have made it easy to defeat a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator. But none of them had worked. [[3261 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, he had used up a huge amount of his magical power. [[3262 旁白 neutral]]
"If this continues, I might really die here." [[3263 欧阳昊泽 fearful]]
As Ouyang Haoze thought of this, a fierce look crossed his face. He formed a hand seal, and the Heavenly Light Armor on his body suddenly let out a sad cry. [[3264 旁白 neutral]]
"This is... Not good!" [[3265 吕阳 surprised]]
Seeing this, Lv Yang's expression changed. He flashed away, instantly moving behind the Blood Sun Sword Pellet and summoning its blood-red shadow to protect him. [[3266 旁白 neutral]]
BOOM!!! [[3267 旁白 neutral]]
The spiritual treasure, the Heavenly Light Armor, self-destructed! [[3268 旁白 neutral]]
The exploding spiritual light was just like the scene Xiao Shiye had created before. It swept in all directions, instantly shattering Lv Yang's sword formation and revealing the clear blue sky. [[3269 旁白 neutral]]
Although Lv Yang reacted quickly and closed the formation, Ouyang Haoze was faster. He rushed out of the formation's encirclement at the last moment. Lv Yang only had time to use the Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light, which drained another thirty percent of his lifeblood, leaving him looking like a bag of bones. [[3270 旁白 neutral]]
"You destroyed my treasure! I will not be satisfied until I have torn you to pieces!" [[3271 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Ouyang Haoze stood outside the marketplace with a ferocious expression. He poured his remaining magical power into his other spiritual treasure, the Taixiao Mirror, causing it to also let out a cry of sorrow. [[3272 旁白 neutral]]
"At worst, I'll sacrifice all my spiritual treasures today! Let's see if you can pull out a third grand array!" [[3273 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
