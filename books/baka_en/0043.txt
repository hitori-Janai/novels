Chapter 43: The Blood-Robed Lord [[3360 旁白 neutral]]
The Divine Martial Sect's invasion ended so abruptly. [[3361 旁白 neutral]]
Once Ouyang Haoze died, Wu Zhichong and Duanmu Yuan didn't even dare to stay. They turned and fled without a second thought, as if a great monster was chasing them. [[3362 旁白 neutral]]
In contrast to the Divine Martial Sect's panicked retreat, the market city was filled with celebration. [[3363 旁白 neutral]]
After all, with this battle over, the Skull Mountain Market was as secure as a fortress. As long as a Foundation Establishment True Master didn't act, it would be difficult for the Divine Martial Sect to break this "turtle shell." [[3364 旁白 neutral]]
As for the corpse tide, it was just a minor problem, not even worth mentioning. [[3365 旁白 neutral]]
In short, it was safe! [[3366 旁白 neutral]]
A safe market city was bound to become a center for money. It was easy to imagine that future transactions here would be more frequent, with more opportunities to earn. [[3367 旁白 neutral]]
The good days were still to come! [[3368 旁白 happy]]
But the excitement belonged to others; Lv Yang only found them noisy. [[3369 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, he was still lost in the lingering fear he had just felt, unable to recover for a long time. [[3370 旁白 neutral]]
For a long time, or rather, ever since Xiao Shiye was lured away by that Daoist Hongyun, Foundation Establishment True Masters had become a lingering shadow in Lv Yang's heart. [[3371 旁白 fearful]]
When he realized that another Foundation Establishment True Master might be plotting against him, the joy of killing Ouyang Haoze vanished instantly. He subconsciously gripped the "Innate Primal Unity Qi Divine Talisman" around his neck, and only after confirming it was still active did his anxious heart settle slightly. [[3372 旁白 fearful]]
"The talisman is still working, which means the other party still can't track me." [[3373 吕阳 neutral]]
Even so, the Divine Talisman of Innate Primal Unity Qi had its limits. [[3374 旁白 neutral]]
Strictly speaking, it didn't sever karmic ties but rather concealed them, placing a false karmic thread around Lv Yang for protection. [[3375 旁白 neutral]]
After all, completely severing karmic ties would be too conspicuous. [[3376 旁白 neutral]]
So when a Foundation Establishment True Master tried to divine him, they wouldn't get nothing, but rather a flawless yet completely false result. [[3377 旁白 neutral]]
The advantage of this was that it was more subtle, but the disadvantage was that it couldn't completely block the influence of a Foundation Establishment True Master. [[3378 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang had an answer in his heart: "Does this mean the other party wasn't specifically targeting me, but I was accidentally drawn in?" [[3379 吕阳 surprised]]
This would also explain the matter of the Profound Yin Treasure Jade. [[3380 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't a stroke of incredible luck, but someone had intentionally delivered this item to him to achieve some ulterior motive. [[3381 旁白 neutral]]
"What motive?" [[3382 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's gaze shifted to Ouyang Haoze's corpse. With a wave of his Myriad Souls Banner, he pulled the bisected body over. [[3383 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps he could find some clues from this man. [[3384 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, as a true disciple of the Divine Martial Sect, Ouyang Haoze's collection must be rich! [[3385 旁白 happy]]
Soon, Ouyang Haoze's body was refined into the Myriad Souls Banner. Unfortunately, since the body was split in two, the extracted true spirit was incomplete. [[3386 旁白 neutral]]
Whether the Myriad Souls Banner could preserve a banner spirit's former combat power, memories, and consciousness depended on the completeness of the corpse. The better preserved the body, the closer the banner spirit was to its living state, like Liu Xin. As for Ouyang Haoze, Lv Yang only managed to preserve about seventy percent of his former state. [[3387 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, he still learned many secrets. [[3388 旁白 neutral]]
"So this was the Divine Martial Sect's true goal." [[3389 吕阳 surprised]]
"There is a secret realm within Skull Mountain, a remnant of the ancient Witch-Ghost Path. The subterranean Yin Qi under Skull Mountain is leaking from that secret realm." [[3390 旁白 neutral]]
"The Divine Martial Sect wanted the secret realm for themselves, which is why they planned to remove the Saint Sect's market here." [[3391 旁白 neutral]]
"This is good news. If I report it back to the Saint Sect, I'll definitely get a lot of contribution points as a reward, and the sect will send reinforcements." [[3392 吕阳 happy]]
"Although keeping this information to myself would be more beneficial... why should I keep it to myself?" [[3393 吕阳 neutral]]
"I'm not planning to venture into that Witch-Ghost secret realm anyway. I might as well hand it over to the Saint Sect for a stable sum of contribution points and watch others fight to the death!" [[3394 吕阳 happy]]
Thinking this, Lv Yang relaxed. [[3395 旁白 neutral]]
Now that he knew a Foundation Establishment True Master was secretly plotting in Skull Mountain, he was even more determined to hide in the market and never go out. [[3396 旁白 neutral]]
Next, Lv Yang began to go through Ouyang Haoze's belongings. [[3397 旁白 neutral]]
But just as he picked up Ouyang Haoze's storage bag, a round mirror trembled and floated over, affectionately rubbing against his hand. [[3398 旁白 neutral]]
It was the Taixiao Mirror. [[3399 旁白 neutral]]
This spirit treasure acted like an eager puppy, circling Lv Yang and hopping a few times, its movements full of loyalty. [[3400 旁白 surprised]]
"Are you abandoning the light for the darkness?" [[3401 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang was a little surprised. Honestly, for a supreme Yang spirit treasure to submit to a demonic cultivator like him, it seemed Ouyang Haoze had truly hurt it deeply. [[3402 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that Lv Yang's attention was finally on it, the Taixiao Mirror first shone on the storage bag in his hand, then shook from side to side. A voice, somewhat childish like a newborn learning to speak, echoed in Lv Yang's mind: [[3403 旁白 neutral]]
"They... are no good!" [[3404 太霄镜 neutral]]
Then, the Taixiao Mirror itself burst into brilliant light, bobbed up and down, and its voice changed, filled with innate pride: [[3405 旁白 neutral]]
"I... am good!" [[3406 太霄镜 happy]]
It was recommending itself. [[3407 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang's expression grew even more amazed. Although he knew spirit treasures had their own intelligence and were incredibly magical, this was the first time he had witnessed it. [[3408 旁白 surprised]]
"Alright, I'll use you for now." [[3409 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang beckoned with his hand, and the Taixiao Mirror immediately flew to him. With its cooperation, he quickly mastered every aspect of the spirit treasure. [[3410 旁白 neutral]]
"Good! What a good treasure!" [[3411 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang's face was full of pleasant surprise. Spirit treasures truly live up to their name! [[3412 旁白 happy]]
It was well-known that the so-called Great Perfection of Qi Refining was a state where a cultivator nurtured their internal Qi seed to its limit, transforming it into a "Perfected True Qi." [[3413 旁白 neutral]]
For example, his "Nine Transformations Dragon Art," upon reaching the Great Perfection of Qi Refining, would produce a "True Dragon's Baleful Qi." [[3414 旁白 neutral]]
In other words, Perfected True Qi was the hallmark of the Great Perfection of Qi Refining and the strongest tool used to suppress all cultivators below that level. [[3415 旁白 neutral]]
However, the Taixiao Mirror, this spirit treasure, was naturally born with a stream of Perfected True Qi called "Taixiao Wind-Thunder Qi"! [[3416 旁白 surprised]]
This meant that whoever wielded this spirit treasure, even with only the first level of Qi Refining, could rival a cultivator at the Great Perfection of Qi Refining while using it! [[3417 旁白 surprised]]
"But there seem to be many restrictions inside this spirit treasure." [[3418 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang studied the Taixiao Mirror. Treasures are meant to be used by people, and this was true even in the righteous path. The Taixiao Mirror clearly contained many restrictions to limit its actions. [[3419 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, if he used this spirit treasure in front of a Divine Martial Sect disciple, they might just perform a hand seal and the Taixiao Mirror would fly back to them. [[3420 旁白 neutral]]
This had nothing to do with the Taixiao Mirror's will; it was a failsafe left by its creator. [[3421 旁白 neutral]]
"It would be such a waste if I can't use a spirit treasure like this." [[3422 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang thought for a moment, and his eyes suddenly lit up. Although his skill in formations wasn't enough to break the restrictions in the mirror, there was a workaround. [[3423 旁白 happy]]
The next moment, Lv Yang shook the Myriad Souls Banner, resummoned Ouyang Haoze, then refined him into a stream of "Innate Unity Qi" and injected it into the Taixiao Mirror. He would control Ouyang Haoze, and Ouyang Haoze would control the Taixiao Mirror, thus bypassing the restrictions. [[3424 旁白 neutral]]
Boom! [[3425 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, the Taixiao Mirror in Lv Yang's hand erupted with a dazzling light, with faint sounds of wind and thunder within it. Its power had clearly reached the level of Qi Refining Perfection! [[3426 旁白 surprised]]
"...It really works!" [[3427 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang laughed freely, then hung the Taixiao Mirror behind his head. For a moment, even the light it emitted turned crimson, dyed with his color. [[3428 旁白 happy]]
"Excellent! Excellent!" [[3429 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang laughed again, then put away the Taixiao Mirror and opened Ouyang Haoze's storage bag. A sudden burst of spiritual energy made him squint. [[3430 旁白 surprised]]
Inside was a huge pile of spirit stones! [[3431 旁白 surprised]]
Besides that, there were various precious pills, magical artifacts, and materials. Lv Yang estimated that selling them to the Saint Sect would be worth at least thirty thousand contribution points. [[3432 旁白 happy]]
"What a huge haul. Unfortunately, there probably won't be another chance like this." [[3433 吕阳 sad]]
After all, with Ouyang Haoze as a precedent, no one below the Foundation Establishment realm would dare to challenge his formation again. [[3434 旁白 neutral]]
'When the news of the Witch-Ghost secret realm spreads, Skull Mountain will become a bloodbath again. A Foundation Establishment True Master must be plotting this from behind the scenes.' [[3435 吕阳 neutral]]
'But as long as I don't go out and don't get involved... unless he acts personally, what can he do to me?' [[3436 吕阳 neutral]]
Having made up his mind, Lv Yang put everything away, deactivated the formation, and flew back to the market on a streak of light, landing on the balcony of the Blood-Robed Tower. [[3437 旁白 neutral]]
From that day on, Skull Mountain fell into a strange calm. [[3438 旁白 neutral]]
The Divine Martial Sect continued to send more people, and reinforcements from the Chu Sheng Sect arrived one after another, but on the surface, there was no conflict, only a hidden undercurrent. [[3439 旁白 neutral]]
In this situation, Lv Yang's story somehow spread and became widely known. [[3440 旁白 neutral]]
Joining the Saint Sect as a mortal ten years ago, making a fortune by speculating on Yin Death-Substitute Puppets, breaking through to the late stage of Qi Refining in a decade of seclusion, becoming a formation master and slaying a true disciple of the Divine Martial Sect at Qi Refining Perfection—such an inspiring story of a commoner's rise gave a strong dose of encouragement to all the ordinary disciples of the Saint Sect. [[3441 旁白 neutral]]
Gradually, out of reverence, many people stopped mentioning Lv Yang's name. [[3442 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, they used another title: [[3443 旁白 neutral]]
'The Blood-Robed Lord'! [[3444 旁白 neutral]]
