Chapter 5: I Will Remember This Grudge [[373 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Liu? He has come for me!?" [[374 吕阳 surprised]]
Hearing the voice outside his cave, Lü Yang's pupils shrank and his face turned grim. He did not reply, and instead concealed his aura. [[375 旁白 fearful]]
".Junior Brother?" [[376 刘信 neutral]]
The voice came again, but Lü Yang still did not answer. Although he had no proof, he was certain there was a problem with the Innate Dao Scripture he was practicing! [[377 旁白 neutral]]
"I was too inexperienced. I can't believe I didn't suspect anything before." [[378 吕阳 angry]]
"The Joyful Union Hall and Sky Mending Peak are closely related, so the cultivation method should be related to dual cultivation. However, the Innate Dao Scripture has nothing to do with it." [[379 吕阳 angry]]
"He tricked me!" [[380 吕阳 angry]]
"But why would he harm me? Although the Chu Sheng Sect is a demonic sect, it still has rules. Private fighting between formal disciples is strictly forbidden. Once discovered..." [[381 吕阳 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lü Yang slapped his forehead. [[382 旁白 neutral]]
"How could I have trusted a demonic sect!" [[383 吕阳 angry]]
"Once discovered... once discovered... If it's not discovered, then it doesn't count as a private fight?" [[384 吕阳 fearful]]
The more Lü Yang thought about it, the uglier his expression became. It was all because of his old habits. Liu Xin's every word and action before had fulfilled the duties of a guide for new disciples. [[385 旁白 neutral]]
He had explained the situation of the inner peaks, the benefits for inner disciples, magical artifacts, pills, and spirit beasts. He had been so helpful and held nothing back, making sure I got everything I was entitled to. Especially at the Treasure Refining Hall, he even told the deacon there to give me the best items. [[386 旁白 neutral]]
But it was all a lie! [[387 旁白 angry]]
Everything he did before was just to make me lower my guard, to make me completely trust his goodwill before he handed me the "Innate Dao Scripture"! [[388 旁白 angry]]
"Thinking about it now, he probably intended to take everything for himself." [[389 吕阳 angry]]
"After all, if he killed me, all the artifacts, pills, and spirit beasts I received would become his... No wonder he specifically asked for the best!" [[390 吕阳 angry]]
That animal! [[391 吕阳 angry]]
Just then, the voice from outside the cave was heard again. [[392 旁白 neutral]]
In the next second, with a "crack," the protective formation around Lü Yang's cave exploded, and the door was torn open by a slash of sword light! [[393 旁白 fearful]]
The door burst open, and Liu Xin, his robes fluttering, strode inside. [[394 旁白 neutral]]
Upon seeing Lü Yang, Liu Xin's face showed a joyful expression, like a farmer seeing a good harvest. He nodded in satisfaction: "Junior Brother, you truly are a talent." [[395 刘信 happy]]
Boom! [[396 旁白 neutral]]
Before Liu Xin could finish his sentence, Lü Yang exploded! [[397 旁白 surprised]]
A massive wave of Innate True Qi, carrying the Bone Jade Sword, transformed into a sharp ray of sword light and slashed towards Liu Xin with unstoppable force. [[398 旁白 angry]]
However, in the next second, the sword light stopped dead. [[399 旁白 neutral]]
".A desperate struggle." [[400 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin did not dodge. He simply formed a hand seal, and Lü Yang instantly lost control of his body, as if he had become someone else's puppet! [[401 旁白 fearful]]
"This Innate Dao Scripture is a wonderful thing." Seeing this, Liu Xin couldn't help but laugh. "A cultivator can transform their body and spirit into a single strand of Innate Qi. It can be used in pills, for refining treasures, or even to increase one's own cultivation. With this treasure, I should be able to reach the late stage of Qi Refining!" [[402 刘信 happy]]
"You can die content, knowing you helped me break through, Junior Brother." [[403 刘信 happy]]
As he spoke, Liu Xin began to change his hand seals. Lü Yang felt his consciousness start to fade, as if it was being forcibly erased! [[404 旁白 fearful]]
At that moment, Lü Yang had a sudden realization: [[405 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the second half of the Innate Dao Scripture!" [[406 吕阳 surprised]]
"The first half is a trap for people to cultivate, and the second half is the real method. It's designed for someone to cultivate the first half and prepare a gift for another!" [[407 吕阳 angry]]
This wasn't a cultivation technique, but a method for refining a treasure. [[408 旁白 neutral]]
But instead of refining an object, it refined a person. It even made the person refine themselves, while the true cultivator hid in the shadows, saving time and effort. [[409 旁白 neutral]]
It was called a Dao Scripture, but it was truly a demonic art! [[410 旁白 angry]]
"You're clever. I'll give you this life." [[411 吕阳 angry]]
Thinking this, Lü Yang stopped resisting and let his consciousness fade. After the initial shock and anger, he had become calm and indifferent. [[412 旁白 neutral]]
"I've learned my lesson. You can trick me once, but I have countless more chances." [[413 吕阳 neutral]]
"I'll remember this grudge!" [[414 吕阳 angry]]
In the next second, Lü Yang's consciousness fell into darkness. [[415 旁白 neutral]]
In the void, only the rustling sound of pages turning could be heard. [[416 旁白 neutral]]
[You were killed by Liu Xin, your consciousness erased and transformed into a strand of Innate True Qi. You are dead.] [[417 旁白 neutral]]
[Current pages remaining in the Hundred Lives Book: 98] [[418 旁白 neutral]]
[Starting a new life, you can choose one of the following rewards from your previous life:] [[419 旁白 neutral]]
[1: A treasure.] [[420 旁白 neutral]]
[2: Your cultivation level.] [[421 旁白 neutral]]
[3: Your lifespan.] [[422 旁白 neutral]]
[4: Give up all rewards and awaken a random talent based on your previous life's experience.] [[423 旁白 neutral]]
"Those whose names are called, come before me." [[424 刘信 neutral]]
The familiar voice came from the stage. Lü Yang clenched his jaw to control his emotions. He did not look up, but focused his thoughts on the panel in front of him. [[425 旁白 neutral]]
Treasure, cultivation, lifespan. [[426 旁白 neutral]]
If he could, Lü Yang would choose cultivation. But he worried that others would notice, and he wouldn't be able to explain where his cultivation came from. [[427 旁白 neutral]]
As for lifespan, he skipped it immediately. [[428 旁白 neutral]]
"Is my only choice the treasure?" [[429 吕阳 sad]]
Lü Yang frowned. The only treasure he had was the Bone Jade Sword, but without cultivation, he couldn't use it. [[430 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, Lü Yang's eyes widened. [[431 旁白 surprised]]
The Hundred Lives Book had just given him a notification. [[432 旁白 neutral]]
"This... can also be considered a treasure?" [[433 吕阳 surprised]]
Lü Yang was first shocked, then thoughtful. Finally, he gritted his teeth and made a decision: Choose one, and keep a treasure from his previous life. [[434 旁白 neutral]]
In the next moment, something strange happened! [[435 旁白 surprised]]
Without alerting anyone, the strange event was confined within Lü Yang's dantian. The source of it was a swirling white gas. [[436 旁白 neutral]]
Innate True Qi! [[437 旁白 surprised]]
The Innate True Qi that Lü Yang had created by refining his organs, flesh, and bones in his past life was also considered a treasure, and he had now exchanged for it! [[438 旁白 happy]]
"Incredible..." Lü Yang lowered his eyes to hide the joy in them. [[439 吕阳 happy]]
He realized that not only could he control this ball of Innate True Qi as if it were his own arm, but he could also use it to cast the spells from his previous life! [[440 旁白 happy]]
"Normally, this should be impossible." [[441 吕阳 neutral]]
"To control Innate True Qi, you need the secret method from the second half of the scripture. But I am different, because this Innate True Qi is me!" [[442 吕阳 happy]]
The two were one and the same. For Lü Yang, it was like having a clone at the first level of Qi Refining. [[443 旁白 neutral]]
"And before I died in my past life, I heard Liu Xin say this Innate True Qi can be used in pills to help break through cultivation realms... This strand of True Qi will be very useful in the future!" [[444 吕阳 happy]]
After reviewing his gains, Lü Yang began his actions for this life. [[445 旁白 neutral]]
First, he was assigned to the Joyful Union Hall again. [[446 旁白 neutral]]
Then, he killed Yu Suzhen. [[447 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, to avoid drawing attention, Lü Yang did not use Senior Sister Yu's primordial yin to break through to the Qi Refining realm. Instead, he fed it all to the Innate True Qi. [[448 旁白 neutral]]
"This life, I will be cautious and not reckless!" [[449 吕阳 neutral]]
As expected, when Liu Xin, who was waiting outside the door, saw that Lü Yang had not broken through after absorbing Yu Suzhen, he immediately lost interest in him. [[450 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Lü Yang waited patiently. [[451 旁白 neutral]]
More than ten days later, a disciple from the Joyful Union Hall named "Qin Yu" broke through. Lü Yang watched as Liu Xin came excitedly to take him away. [[452 旁白 neutral]]
A few days later, Liu Xin announced he was entering seclusion, and a different senior brother took over the duty of guiding new disciples. [[453 旁白 neutral]]
But Lü Yang still did not show himself. [[454 旁白 neutral]]
"Who knows what this new senior brother is like. What if he's the same as Liu Xin... Hmm, it's better if I don't stand out." [[455 吕阳 neutral]]
"To be safe, I'll wait another month." [[456 吕阳 neutral]]
Another half a month passed. Only after another outer disciple broke through to Qi Refining and was promoted to the inner peak without any issues did Lü Yang choose to break through. [[457 旁白 neutral]]
With the help of the Innate True Qi, Lü Yang could have broken through without dual cultivation. [[458 旁白 neutral]]
However, to hide his secret, he still randomly chose a few outer disciples to absorb yin from. [[459 旁白 neutral]]
This time, the formal disciple who guided him was much more careless and not as enthusiastic as Liu Xin. He even looked at Lü Yang with some disgust. [[460 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the Library Pavilion." [[461 陌生男1 neutral]]
After receiving his benefits, the disciple led him to a pavilion and said casually, "Take this token and go inside. Use your contribution points to exchange for whatever cultivation method you want." [[462 陌生男1 neutral]]
After saying that, the disciple left. [[463 旁白 neutral]]
Lü Yang, however, felt a sense of relief. There were advantages to being a nobody. The fact that this person looked down on him was exactly what he wanted. [[464 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lü Yang turned to look at Sky Mending Peak in the distance. [[465 旁白 neutral]]
"Liu Xin... hmph!" [[466 吕阳 angry]]
A few days ago, Liu Xin came out of seclusion and successfully broke through to the late stage of Qi Refining. He even became a personal disciple of the Sky Mending Peak's master and was currently enjoying his success. [[467 旁白 neutral]]
Lü Yang snorted coldly, looked away, and strode into the Library Pavilion. [[468 旁白 angry]]
Although he wanted revenge, he was too weak now. Without power, the most urgent task was to cultivate diligently. Everything else could wait until he was strong. [[469 旁白 neutral]]
A gentleman's revenge is not too late even after ten years. [[470 旁白 neutral]]
It was just a temporary measure, there was no rush! [[471 旁白 neutral]]
