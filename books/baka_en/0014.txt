Chapter 14: Dog Eat Dog! [[1098 旁白 neutral]]
A flash of sword light, a roar of thunder. [[1099 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, the sword light took Zhao Xuhe's head. But before his head could hit the ground, his body suddenly exploded into a pile of bones. [[1100 旁白 neutral]]
"I wonder which fellow disciple is waiting for me here?" [[1101 赵旭河 surprised]]
After the bones shattered, a dark energy flew out and reformed into Zhao Xuhe's shape a hundred meters away, his face still showing fear. [[1102 旁白 neutral]]
But before he could finish speaking, the sword light followed him like a shadow. [[1103 旁白 neutral]]
Swoosh—! [[1104 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, Zhao Xuhe's head flew up again, only to turn back into scattered bones. The dark energy retreated another hundred meters and his figure reappeared. [[1105 旁白 neutral]]
"I—" [[1106 赵旭河 fearful]]
Boom! [[1107 旁白 neutral]]
"You—" [[1108 赵旭河 angry]]
Crack! [[1109 旁白 neutral]]
"Enough!" [[1110 赵旭河 angry]]
After dozens of sword lights filled the space and killed Zhao Xuhe more than ten times, he finally managed to regroup and seize a chance to dodge the attack. [[1111 旁白 neutral]]
It was only a brief moment, but Zhao Xuhe grasped it precisely. He flicked his wide sleeve, and a cloud of blood-red dust instantly rolled out to protect him. Then, he swallowed several pills to recover his injuries and True Qi before looking around. [[1112 旁白 neutral]]
"Lv Yang, it's you!" [[1113 赵旭河 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe's gaze was sharp. He recognized the sword light that had killed him over ten times as the Divine Firmament Sword Control Art and immediately called out Lv Yang's identity. [[1114 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, he was shocked beyond words. [[1115 旁白 neutral]]
He had personally experienced the power of the sword light and knew it was not something an early-stage Qi Refining cultivator could do. In just a few days, Lv Yang had actually reached the middle-stage of Qi Refining. [[1116 旁白 neutral]]
"This person must have a great opportunity!" [[1117 赵旭河 surprised]]
Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe's anger faded, replaced by a strange joy. "Good, good, good. Today is truly a day of double happiness. I'll take this opportunity for myself!" [[1118 赵旭河 happy]]
Outside the bewildering formation, Lv Yang's expression was serious. [[1119 旁白 neutral]]
"How troublesome..." [[1120 吕阳 neutral]]
He thought he had been ruthless enough, but Zhao Xuhe still found a sliver of hope and survived his initial attack. [[1121 旁白 neutral]]
He had even been identified. [[1122 旁白 neutral]]
But with the bewildering formation confusing his enemy, his real body was hidden. He was attacking from a distance with his flying sword. If they really fought, his chances of winning were higher. [[1123 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Zhao Xuhe also discovered the bewildering formation. It was only a crude trap, and he could break it with a little time. But with Lv Yang interfering and his own True Qi at less than half its peak, he was helpless for the moment. [[1124 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe's eyes darted, and he suddenly spoke: [[1125 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Lv, we don't really have any hatred between us." [[1126 赵旭河 neutral]]
"Go!" [[1127 吕阳 angry]]
Strike while the iron is hot. Lv Yang would not chat with Zhao Xuhe and give him a chance to heal. He immediately formed a sword seal and continued his attack. [[1128 旁白 neutral]]
"Tsk! You're doing this the hard way!" [[1129 赵旭河 angry]]
Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe's gaze turned cold. He gave up on stalling and formed a seal, summoning a metal seal into the air. [[1130 旁白 neutral]]
This item was called the "Prime Magnetism Gold Seal." It could attract all metal objects and was a specific counter to flying swords. It was Zhao Xuhe's secret treasure, which he had planned to use on the battlefield against disciples of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion. He had taken it out early to counter Lv Yang's sword light. [[1131 旁白 neutral]]
"Freeze!" [[1132 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe activated the seal, precisely catching a slashing sword light. The seal fell and instantly subdued the sword light, making it unable to move. [[1133 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang, however, looked calm. [[1134 旁白 neutral]]
He was still at his peak, while Zhao Xuhe was weak. This battle of attrition was in his favor, so he wasn't worried. [[1135 旁白 neutral]]
"My biggest advantage now is that I'm hidden by the formation. Zhao Xuhe can't find me. Even if he has a trump card, it's useless if he can't see me. As long as I keep wearing him down, I will be the one who wins." [[1136 吕阳 neutral]]
So Lv Yang decided he would not show himself. [[1137 旁白 neutral]]
My flying sword? I don't need it. [[1138 吕阳 neutral]]
You can't refine my flying sword anytime soon, and you have to waste True Qi to suppress it. That's exactly what I want. Let's see how long you can last! [[1139 吕阳 neutral]]
"Rumble!" [[1140 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang stood outside the formation and channeled his True Qi. A white mist rose from his head and formed a handprint several meters wide, which he sent flying into the formation. [[1141 旁白 neutral]]
This technique wasn't special; it was pure brute force. [[1142 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe's face darkened. He knew Lv Yang had seen through his plan. [[1143 旁白 neutral]]
"You bastard!" [[1144 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe cursed silently. They were both in the middle-stage of Qi Refining, yet his opponent was so cautious. How could he turn the tables? [[1145 旁白 neutral]]
He still had the strength for a final, desperate fight. But even if he killed Lv Yang, he himself would not survive. How could he accept that, after finally getting such a great opportunity? [[1146 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing his True Qi draining away, Zhao Xuhe finally couldn't take it anymore and shouted, "Brother Lv, do you know what opportunity I found on this Panlong Island? A third-grade true technique that leads directly to the Golden Core path! If you stop now, I am willing to share it with you!" [[1147 赵旭河 neutral]]
"A third-grade true technique?" [[1148 吕阳 surprised]]
Outside the formation, Lv Yang stood up abruptly. Cultivation techniques had nine grades and thirty-six ranks. Below the seventh grade, there was no hope for Foundation Establishment. Below the third grade, there was no path to the Golden Core. [[1149 旁白 neutral]]
And now, Zhao Xuhe was offering a technique that could cultivate third-grade True Qi and lead to the Golden Core realm! [[1150 旁白 neutral]]
What a great opportunity! [[1151 吕阳 surprised]]
"No, wait." [[1152 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang took a deep breath, suppressed his greed, and sat back down. "He's offering a great reward to lure me out. If I go out, I'll fall into his trap." [[1153 旁白 neutral]]
"How about it, Brother Lv? Can we make a deal?" [[1154 赵旭河 neutral]]
Inside the formation, Zhao Xuhe was still trying to persuade him when a voice suddenly came from all directions: "Fool. If I kill you, the technique will be mine anyway!" [[1155 吕阳 neutral]]
"You are mistaken, Brother Lv." Zhao Xuhe shook his head and smiled. "Opportunities are destined by fate. I earned this third-grade technique through three lifetimes of hard cultivation. It is not fated for you. Even if you kill me, the technique will just fly away. You will not be able to get it." [[1156 赵旭河 neutral]]
"What?" [[1157 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang was stunned, his expression flickering. An opportunity destined by fate? Not fated for him, so it would fly away? [[1158 旁白 neutral]]
But he quickly recovered and sneered, "If that's the case, why should I make a deal with you for it?" [[1159 吕阳 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe quickly explained, "You were not fated to have the technique, but if I willingly share it with you, then your fate will change." [[1160 赵旭河 neutral]]
"...Fine." [[1161 吕阳 neutral]]
After a moment of silence, Lv Yang said, "Make a copy of the technique for me, and I'll let you out." [[1162 吕阳 neutral]]
"It's a deal." Zhao Xuhe agreed immediately. He took out a jade box, opened it, and revealed two volumes of a Daoist scripture inside. [[1163 旁白 neutral]]
"The first volume is the 'Nine Transformations Dragonization Art,' a Qi Refining technique that lets you cultivate a 'True Dragon Aura,' making you a top fighter at your level. The second volume is the 'Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon Riding Ascension Scroll,' a Foundation Establishment technique that lets you build a 'Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon Riding' Dao foundation, with the hope of reaching the Golden Core path in the future." [[1164 赵旭河 neutral]]
After introducing the technique, Zhao Xuhe's tone suddenly changed: [[1165 旁白 neutral]]
"But Brother Lv, I am injured and my True Qi is weak. What if I give you the technique and you go back on your word and kill me?" [[1166 赵旭河 neutral]]
"...That's simple." [[1167 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's eyes darted as he suggested, "You can give me the 'Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon Riding Ascension Scroll' first and keep the 'Nine Transformations Dragonization Art' for yourself." [[1168 吕阳 neutral]]
"I'm only in the Qi Refining realm, so I can't practice the Foundation Establishment technique even if I have it. You don't have to worry about me going back on my word and harming you." Lv Yang said with a sincere expression. "After I let you out, you can give me the 'Nine Transformations Dragonization Art.' How about that?" [[1169 吕阳 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe thought about it and felt that Lv Yang's words made a lot of sense. [[1170 旁白 neutral]]
"A deal is a deal!" [[1171 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe took out the "Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon Riding Ascension Scroll" from the jade box. Lv Yang still did not show himself but instead formed a large hand of True Qi to grab it from a distance. [[1172 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe could only sigh, giving up his last bit of hope. He obediently handed the technique to Lv Yang. [[1173 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang took the technique and memorized it word by word, then grinned. [[1174 旁白 happy]]
"Goodbye!" [[1175 吕阳 happy]]
The next second, Lv Yang gathered his Qi and activated the Life-Ending Curse, blowing himself up! [[1176 旁白 neutral]]
Boom! [[1177 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, the dust and smoke cleared, revealing Zhao Xuhe's stunned face. [[1178 旁白 surprised]]
"My technique... is gone?" [[1179 赵旭河 sad]]
Why did he self-destruct? [[1180 旁白 neutral]]
And why did he wait until after he got the technique to do it? I haven't even had a chance to read it myself! [[1181 旁白 sad]]
"Lv Yang..." [[1182 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe stood in the wind, staring at the ashes of the "Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon Riding Ascension Scroll." As he chanted Lv Yang's name, his expression gradually twisted. [[1183 旁白 neutral]]
"You animal!" [[1184 赵旭河 angry]]
