Chapter 8: A Slave's Tale of Cultivation [[626 旁白 neutral]]
"If I have to be a worker, so be it!" [[627 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang quickly adjusted his mood. [[628 旁白 neutral]]
"Strictly speaking, I could commit suicide and restart right now, but the Hundred Lives Book has a limited number of pages. It would be too much of a loss to restart just like this." [[629 吕阳 neutral]]
Although he was now a formal disciple, Lv Yang still knew very little about the Chu Sheng Sect, and his knowledge of the cultivation world was limited to what he had read in books. He had already thought about restarting, but to gain an advantage for his next life, he needed to live longer in this one. [[630 旁白 neutral]]
There were countless cave residences on Sky Mending Peak, but only two places stood out. One was the Peak Master's residence, and the other was a tall building. [[631 旁白 neutral]]
The building had nine floors and was called the Hall of Merit. [[632 旁白 neutral]]
Most formal disciples came to the Hall of Merit to trade, post bounties, and accept sect missions, all under the protection of the sect. [[633 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang walked into the Hall of Merit and approached a counter. [[634 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, can I accept sect missions here?" [[635 吕阳 neutral]]
"Of course, you... Hmm?" [[636 赵旭河 surprised]]
The young Daoist behind the counter glanced at Lv Yang carelessly at first, but his eyes lit up when he saw his handsome face. [[637 旁白 neutral]]
In the next second, a friendly smile appeared on the young Daoist's face. [[638 旁白 neutral]]
"No need to call me Senior Brother. My name is Zhao Xuhe, a deacon disciple at the Hall of Merit. You must be a new disciple, Junior Brother, right? I haven't seen you before." [[639 赵旭河 happy]]
"I am Lv Yang. Greetings, Senior Brother." [[640 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang quickly bowed and activated his disciple token to verify his identity. [[641 旁白 neutral]]
After looking at the token, Zhao Xuhe's expression softened, and his smile grew even wider. "Not bad, not bad. Junior Brother Lv, you have a fine appearance. Very impressive." [[642 赵旭河 happy]]
Zhao Xuhe sized him up with a look that made Lv Yang uncomfortable, then suddenly said, "Junior Brother Lv, since you're looking for a sect mission, I have one right here. Or rather, it's a great fortune I can offer you. If you succeed, I guarantee your future in cultivation will be bright." [[643 赵旭河 happy]]
"Really?" [[644 吕阳 surprised]]
On the surface, Lv Yang looked interested, but inwardly, he became alert. [[645 旁白 neutral]]
"I guarantee it! It couldn't be more real!" [[646 赵旭河 happy]]
Zhao Xuhe grinned, pointed towards the top of Sky Mending Peak, and said, "The current Peak Master is looking for a husband for his daughter, and I think you have a fine appearance..." [[647 赵旭河 happy]]
Lv Yang: "???" [[648 吕阳 surprised]]
I came here for a sect mission, hoping to earn resources with my own two hands through hard work. And now you want me to be a kept man? [[649 吕阳 angry]]
"What, you're not interested?" [[650 赵旭河 surprised]]
Seeing Lv Yang's stiff expression, Zhao Xuhe tried to persuade him even more eagerly. "This is a huge opportunity! If you can get into the Peak Master's residence, you'll become a Foundation Establishment disciple. Contribution points, techniques, resources—you'll have everything. This one step will save you sixty years of hard work." [[651 赵旭河 happy]]
Despite Zhao Xuhe's extravagant promises, Lv Yang remained unmoved. [[652 旁白 neutral]]
In truth, if it was really just about being a kept man, Lv Yang wouldn't have minded. [[653 旁白 neutral]]
But what was this place? The Chu Sheng Sect! An orthodox Demonic Sect! With the cautionary tale of Liu Xin fresh in his mind, how could he believe Zhao Xuhe's talk about marriage? [[654 旁白 neutral]]
There's definitely a catch! [[655 吕阳 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang sighed and said, "Senior Brother Zhao, it's not that I don't want to marry in, but I have a problem that is hard to talk about." [[656 吕阳 sad]]
Zhao Xuhe was stunned. "A problem that is hard to talk about?" [[657 赵旭河 surprised]]
"To be honest," Lv Yang said with a look of shame, "I suffer from a venereal disease." [[658 吕阳 sad]]
As soon as he said this, the warmth on Zhao Xuhe's face instantly cooled. [[659 旁白 neutral]]
A venereal disease wasn't a big deal; he had ways to cure it. The real issue was why he had it in the first place. The reason behind it was the key. [[660 旁白 neutral]]
"Sigh, what a pity." [[661 赵旭河 sad]]
Zhao Xuhe shook his head. No matter how handsome Lv Yang was, the Peak Master would never allow his daughter to become cultivation partners with a man who could get himself sick like that. [[662 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang said respectfully, "Thank you for your concern, Senior Brother." [[663 吕阳 neutral]]
No one gets angry at a smiling face. Seeing Lv Yang's respectful attitude, Zhao Xuhe's expression softened a little. "In that case, I'll pick a good mission for you." [[664 赵旭河 neutral]]
"What kind of mission are you looking for?" [[665 赵旭河 neutral]]
Lv Yang said, "One with high contribution points and is relatively safe." [[666 吕阳 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe's smile didn't change, as he had expected this. After all, every new disciple wanted this kind of mission. "I happen to have one right here." [[667 赵旭河 happy]]
With that, he handed Lv Yang a jade slip. [[668 旁白 neutral]]
"The Yin-Yang Immortal Flower. It needs to be nurtured with the blood and essence of a Qi Refining cultivator to survive. Sky Mending Peak buys them at the highest price, 150 contribution points per flower." [[669 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe said kindly, "This is a mission issued by the Peak Master himself, with no quantity limit. He'll buy as many as you can grow. And you don't need any special planting skills, Junior Brother. The Yin-Yang Immortal Flower is very resilient. As long as you plant it in your cave residence, it won't wither easily." [[670 赵旭河 happy]]
Lv Yang was tempted at first, but he soon shook his head again. [[671 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe frowned. "What's wrong?" [[672 赵旭河 neutral]]
"Thank you for the guidance, Senior Brother, but..." Lv Yang said with a bitter expression, "I still have to pay next month's rent for my cave residence. I can't afford to buy the Immortal Flower seeds." [[673 吕阳 sad]]
"I see." [[674 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe also sighed. "I've been through this stage too, Junior Brother. I know it's not easy for you... Fine, I'll help you out." [[675 赵旭河 happy]]
Then, Zhao Xuhe held out his hand. "Give me your disciple token." [[676 赵旭河 neutral]]
Lv Yang obediently handed it over. A moment later, he was surprised to find that 500 contribution points had appeared on his token! [[677 旁白 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe smiled slightly. "These are your reserve contribution points from the Three Rivers Association. You can use them whenever you need them. Go and buy the Immortal Flower seeds." [[678 赵旭河 happy]]
Lv Yang frowned. "Senior Brother, isn't this the same as a technique loan? I'm afraid..." [[679 吕阳 fearful]]
"The Three Rivers Association is a major power in the sect's inner circle. New disciples can even enjoy a 30-day interest-free period on their loans. It's much cheaper than the sect's technique loans." [[680 赵旭河 neutral]]
"Besides, don't you want to buy Immortal Flower seeds?" Zhao Xuhe's tone was gentle and kind. "A senior brother in our Three Rivers Association specializes in selling them. Since you've taken a loan from us, I'll put in a good word for you so he can sell them to you at cost." [[681 赵旭河 happy]]
"Is there really such a good deal?" Lv Yang's face lit up with pleasant surprise. [[682 吕阳 surprised]]
"It's because I feel a connection with you, Junior Brother." Zhao Xuhe also laughed heartily. "If not for that, I wouldn't tell just anyone about this opportunity!" [[683 赵旭河 happy]]
After speaking, Zhao Xuhe took out another jade slip and handed it to Lv Yang. "This is that senior brother's communication slip. I wish you a speedy fortune, Junior Brother." [[684 赵旭河 happy]]
"Thank you, Senior Brother!" [[685 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang left, thanking him profusely. [[686 旁白 neutral]]
Watching his retreating back, a cold smile appeared on Zhao Xuhe's lips before he started looking for his next target in the Hall of Merit. [[687 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang didn't rush to find the "reliable senior brother" Zhao Xuhe had recommended. Instead, he returned to his cave residence and did some calculations. [[688 旁白 neutral]]
"A loan of 500 contribution points can buy ten Immortal Flower seeds. The annual interest rate is 36%, same as the technique loan." [[689 吕阳 neutral]]
"Waking up early and working late, watering them with blood essence and spiritual energy, it will probably take a year for them to mature and earn 1500 contribution points." [[690 吕阳 neutral]]
"After paying the rent, I'll only have 1140 contribution points left." [[691 吕阳 neutral]]
"The technique loan's principal and interest will be another 460, leaving me with 680. Then the 500 for the flower seeds plus 180 in interest is due..." [[692 吕阳 neutral]]
"It's all gone!?" [[693 吕阳 surprised]]
Where's my money? [[694 吕阳 surprised]]
With this question in mind, Lv Yang calculated again. He stared at his hands blankly for a long time before coming to his senses, then laughed in anger. [[695 旁白 neutral]]
What a scheme. They didn't even leave me money for food! [[696 吕阳 angry]]
Truly worthy of the Chu Sheng Sect! [[697 吕阳 angry]]
As a sect disciple, you start with debt, then the sect stretches your finances to the limit. The points you earn from missions are just enough to cover expenses. [[698 旁白 neutral]]
If you want to earn more and save up, you have to work overtime and take on more missions. [[699 旁白 neutral]]
Otherwise, with the slightest mistake, your financial chain will break, and the huge loans on your back will be the final straw that breaks the camel's back. [[700 旁白 neutral]]
As long as you are willing to endure hardship, you will have endless hardship to endure. [[701 旁白 neutral]]
To put it bluntly, they use the basic needs of the lower-level disciples to force them to work desperately, all to contribute to the glory of the Chu Sheng Sect. [[702 旁白 neutral]]
"Bastards!" [[703 吕阳 angry]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang couldn't help but curse, then comforted himself: [[704 旁白 neutral]]
"I work for the sect, the sect gives me contribution points. The loans and the cave residence take back contribution points. It's a closed loop for the sect, and I get to enjoy the benefits in the middle!" [[705 吕阳 angry]]
Then, Lv Yang thought of the friendly and attentive Zhao Xuhe and looked at the 500-point loan on his disciple token with a cold sneer. [[706 旁白 neutral]]
"And since you are not kind, don't blame me for not being righteous." [[707 吕阳 angry]]
"High-interest loans? I'll just default!" [[708 吕阳 angry]]
Despite saying this, the slave-like situation of the sect disciples still made Lv Yang feel suffocated. The more he thought about it, the worse he felt, and a nameless fire rose within him. [[709 旁白 neutral]]
"...Demon?" [[710 云妙清 surprised]]
Just then, the curtain was lifted. It turned out that Yun Miaoqing had heard Lv Yang's cursing, so she got out of bed to check on the situation. [[711 旁白 neutral]]
