Chapter 36: Skull Mountain Market [[2804 旁白 neutral]]
Relying on his knowledge of Zhao Xuhe from several lifetimes, Lv Yang quickly grew close to him, allowing Zhao Xuhe to feel a long-lost respect from an outsider. [[2805 旁白 neutral]]
To be honest, he hadn't felt this way for many years. [[2806 旁白 sad]]
Ever since the price of the Death-Substitute Yin Puppets crashed and Coiling Dragon Island mysteriously disappeared—a matter whose cause even his master, the lord of Sky Mending Peak, could not divine—his life had become increasingly difficult. [[2807 旁白 sad]]
First, his master grew more and more disappointed in him. Second, his cultivation stalled. Ten years had passed, yet he remained at the middle stage of Qi Refining, unable to break through his bottleneck. If there was any good news, it was that his master, seeing his worsening situation, had canceled his marriage arrangement with his junior sister. [[2808 旁白 sad]]
In this world, things are always changing, and people can be warm one moment and cold the next. Zhao Xuhe had experienced this all too well over the past ten years. [[2809 旁白 sad]]
Therefore, when he heard that Lv Yang had managed to get out at the peak of the Death-Substitute Yin Puppet prices and become financially free, Zhao Xuhe's eyes turned red with envy. [[2810 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah, Junior Brother, your Dao heart is so firm, not swayed by wealth. Your future is limitless. It's a pity I didn't have a Dao heart like yours back then." [[2811 赵旭河 sad]]
"Senior Brother, you shouldn't belittle yourself." [[2812 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang comforted him in a low voice, "Fortune is not decided in a single moment. As long as you remain determined on the path of cultivation, what do temporary setbacks matter?" [[2813 吕阳 neutral]]
"You're right." [[2814 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe nodded, seeming to have cheered up a little. Then, he glanced at Lv Yang hesitantly and opened his mouth, but said nothing. [[2815 旁白 neutral]]
To Lv Yang, his intention was as clear as day. [[2816 旁白 neutral]]
He wants to borrow money. [[2817 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang smiled slightly. Since Zhao Xuhe didn't mention it, he wouldn't bring it up either. After all, if you get something too easily, you won't know how to cherish it. [[2818 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a voice suddenly came from the flying boat: [[2819 旁白 neutral]]
"We have arrived at Skull Mountain!" [[2820 陌生男1 neutral]]
Northern Frontier, Skull Mountain. [[2821 旁白 neutral]]
It was called a mountain, but it was actually a large mountain range stretching for hundreds of miles, with peaks clustered together like waves. Every inch of the land was overflowing with spiritual energy. [[2822 旁白 neutral]]
There was a good reason why the Chu Sheng Sect established a market here. Although it couldn't compare to the Sea of Clouds, for worldly rogue cultivators, Skull Mountain was already a treasure land. At the very center of the mountain range was a cave of white bones, where the sect's market was located. [[2823 旁白 neutral]]
"The feng shui of this place... it's a place of extreme yin." [[2824 吕阳 surprised]]
On the deck of the flying boat, Lv Yang looked down at the lay of the land of Skull Mountain, somewhat surprised. "Any cultivator buried here would surely turn into a zombie within ten years." [[2825 吕阳 neutral]]
"Junior Brother has sharp eyes." [[2826 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
A rosy light flashed, and Fairy Feixia, her feathered cloak fluttering, walked out. "That is why the sect sent us to guard Skull Mountain and maintain order in the market." [[2827 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
"Just as you said, Junior Brother, due to the special feng shui, a large-scale corpse tide appears on Skull Mountain every thirty years. These zombies have no intelligence and only know how to devour the living. This is a risk, but also an opportunity. After all, these zombies are excellent materials for refining artifacts." [[2828 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
After explaining, Fairy Feixia continued: [[2829 旁白 neutral]]
"The market is protected by the 'Hundred Skeletons Restoration Array'. There are four array eyes. Fellow Daoist Lu and Fellow Daoist Chen are in charge of two. For the remaining two, how about you and I each take one, Junior Brother?" [[2830 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
"I will follow your arrangements, Senior Sister." [[2831 吕阳 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia nodded upon hearing this, then her brows furrowed slightly as she glanced at Zhao Xuhe, who stood beside Lv Yang with wide, unbelieving eyes. [[2832 旁白 neutral]]
"What is it?" Lv Yang asked curiously. "Do you know Senior Brother Zhao, Senior Sister?" [[2833 吕阳 neutral]]
"...No." [[2834 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia coldly withdrew her gaze from Zhao Xuhe and turned to Lv Yang with a gentle smile. "I will be counting on your help in the future, Junior Brother." [[2835 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
With that, she flew away on a ray of rosy light. [[2836 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe remained where he was, his expression complicated. He had clearly guessed that since Lv Yang was assigned to guard the market, his true strength was definitely not the middle stage of Qi Refining that he had sensed. [[2837 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Zhao?" [[2838 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's voice came, and Zhao Xuhe froze. [[2839 旁白 neutral]]
A mixed expression of joy and misery appeared on his face. His lips moved, but he made no sound. His posture finally became respectful as he called out clearly: [[2840 旁白 neutral]]
"Sir." [[2841 赵旭河 neutral]]
Seeing this, Lv Yang could only sigh helplessly. "Senior Brother Zhao, I have official business to attend to. If you have any difficulties in the future, feel free to contact me." [[2842 吕阳 neutral]]
With that, he also flew away. [[2843 旁白 neutral]]
Only Zhao Xuhe was left, his expression uncertain. The many emotions from before quickly vanished, replaced by a look of deep thought. [[2844 旁白 neutral]]
"He's wary of me. It seems I was too hasty." [[2845 旁白 neutral]]
Entering the market, Lv Yang recalled Zhao Xuhe's reaction and couldn't help but chuckle. "Just as I expected, he has another purpose for coming to this market." [[2846 吕阳 neutral]]
"Good, very good!" [[2847 吕阳 happy]]
"In this life, I will make him my closest friend!" [[2848 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang was not afraid of Zhao Xuhe's wariness because he had enough patience. [[2849 旁白 neutral]]
If necessary, he was even willing to give up this life and genuinely be Zhao Xuhe's friend for a lifetime, just to gather information for the next one! [[2850 旁白 neutral]]
As he thought, Lv Yang arrived in front of a pavilion. [[2851 旁白 neutral]]
This place was one of the four array eyes of the market, and also the area with the most spiritual energy on Skull Mountain, probably about thirty percent as good as a cave-dwelling in the Chu Sheng Sect. [[2852 旁白 neutral]]
"Blood-Washing Celestial River Sword Formation, rise!" [[2853 吕阳 neutral]]
With a wave of his sleeve, Lv Yang sent the Blood Sun Sword Pellet flying into the pavilion to act as the core. Then, array patterns spread out, replacing the original ones. [[2854 旁白 neutral]]
Although the market's "Hundred Skeletons Restoration Array" was more profound than his Blood-Washing Celestial River Sword Formation, Lv Yang only controlled one of the array eyes. Furthermore, as an array master, he disliked entrusting his life to an array set up by someone else. [[2855 旁白 neutral]]
"After all, I have quite a few secrets..." [[2856 吕阳 neutral]]
"Besides, the Skull Mountain Market has been established for so long that the effects of this 'Hundred Skeletons Restoration Array' are common knowledge, no matter how clever it is." [[2857 旁白 neutral]]
The more your secrets are exposed, the easier it is for others to target you. [[2858 旁白 neutral]]
So, if a powerful figure were to attack the Skull Mountain Market, they would surely come prepared with ways to break the "Hundred Skeletons Restoration Array." [[2859 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, the array might not be of much use. [[2860 旁白 neutral]]
That said, Lv Yang didn't abandon the array completely. Instead, he opened up a new area within the pavilion, hiding his own array within the larger one, which served as a hidden card. [[2861 旁白 neutral]]
After doing all this, Lv Yang nodded with satisfaction. [[2862 旁白 neutral]]
Then, with another wave of his hand, he named the pavilion 'Blood-Robed Tower,' officially settling down in the Skull Mountain Market and giving himself a title. [[2863 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, more than a dozen streaks of light flew over. [[2864 旁白 neutral]]
These were the Chu Sheng Sect disciples assigned to Lv Yang's area. Their cultivation levels were generally in the early and middle stages of Qi Refining, and they were also here at the market for missions. [[2865 旁白 neutral]]
The lights faded after flying into the Blood-Robed Tower, revealing cultivators of all ages and appearances. They came to the balcony with awe on their faces and saw a handsome, blood-robed young man leaning against the railing, smiling as he looked down on them all. [[2866 旁白 neutral]]
"Greetings, Tower Master!" [[2867 陌生男1 neutral]]
The disciples did not dare to be slow and bowed in unison. Although they could call each other senior and junior brother within the sect, they had to use official titles outside of it. [[2868 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, this was a senior brother in the late stage of Qi Refining! [[2869 旁白 neutral]]
Early stage, middle stage, late stage, and grand completion of the Qi Refining realm might seem like four small stages, but the gap between them was immense. [[2870 旁白 neutral]]
"At ease." [[2871 吕阳 neutral]]
Looking at the row of figures below, Lv Yang nodded with satisfaction, thinking to himself, "Not bad. They all look like workhorses. No capable people among them." [[2872 吕阳 neutral]]
The Chu Sheng Sect had a top-tier cultivation environment. Generally, cultivators who chose to be stationed outside were either like Lv Yang and Fairy Feixia, aiming for Foundation Establishment, or like these people here—with poor talent, old age, and no money, unable to get by in the sect. [[2873 旁白 neutral]]
"If I wanted to, I could kill them all with a single sword..." [[2874 吕阳 neutral]]
Someone looking to build a force might be unhappy with this situation, but Lv Yang felt it was just right. The atmosphere of weakness made him feel very secure. [[2875 吕阳 happy]]
"You are all dismissed. Make your own decisions on small matters; no need to come to me." [[2876 吕阳 neutral]]
After giving his orders, Lv Yang sent them away and sealed the Blood-Robed Tower, preparing to cultivate peacefully in seclusion until the opportunity for Foundation Establishment appeared! [[2877 旁白 neutral]]
