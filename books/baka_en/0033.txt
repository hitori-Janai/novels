Chapter 33: The Innate Primal-Unity Qi Divine Talisman [[2580 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, Lv Yang held a yellowed paper talisman in his hand, looking at it with great interest. [[2581 旁白 neutral]]
After refining Liu Xin into a banner spirit, Lv Yang made him tell his life story, including how he trapped and killed Chen Xinan, and how he avoided the divination of the Foundation Establishment master. [[2582 旁白 neutral]]
"The Innate Primal-Unity Qi Divine Talisman?" [[2583 吕阳 surprised]]
"That is the one." Liu Xin bowed his head to the ground and said respectfully, "This talisman was left by the Innate Daoist. As long as you carry it, you can avoid karmic divination." [[2584 刘信 neutral]]
Lv Yang nodded with satisfaction and gently shook the Myriad Spirits Banner. A handsome young man in a black robe came down from it. The man was startled to see Lv Yang, then his body trembled as he looked at Liu Xin, who had become a banner spirit. [[2585 旁白 neutral]]
"Haha... hahaha! You finally got what you deserve!" [[2586 陈信安 happy]]
Chen Xinan looked up and laughed, then turned to Liu Xin. "I thought you were incompetent, but I never imagined you were this useless." [[2587 陈信安 happy]]
"You were turned into a banner spirit by someone else?" [[2588 陈信安 surprised]]
"How did you manage that?" [[2589 陈信安 angry]]
Faced with Chen Xinan's mockery, Liu Xin just lowered his head and did not answer. Only then did Chen Xinan turn to look at Lv Yang. [[2590 旁白 neutral]]
"You are truly a disciple of our Holy Sect." Chen Xinan praised, clapping his hands with a smile. "Junior Brother, I won't ask you to release me for reincarnation. Since you killed Liu Xin, you have avenged me... How about this? I will give you a hidden treasure as a reward." [[2591 陈信安 neutral]]
"I am a banner spirit now, so you can naturally see if I am telling the truth or not." [[2592 陈信安 neutral]]
"The treasure is on an island deep in the Sea of Clouds, called Gourd Island. Your cultivation is still low, so it's best to go after you reach the peak of Qi Refining..." [[2593 陈信安 neutral]]
"No need." [[2594 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang showed no interest and shook his head indifferently. "Senior Brother Chen, we are both disciples of the Holy Sect. Why pretend?" [[2595 吕阳 neutral]]
"...Junior Brother, you have misunderstood me." [[2596 陈信安 sad]]
Chen Xinan sighed softly. "Although most disciples of our Holy Sect don't care about fellowship, we always repay our debts. We are not heartless villains." [[2597 陈信安 sad]]
"Stop trying to make yourself look good." Lv Yang interrupted him without hesitation, sneering, "Are there any good people among the Holy Sect disciples? Every single one who survives is a bad person! Senior Brother Chen, don't waste your energy. I will not go to your hidden treasure." [[2598 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang was extremely wary of this true disciple. [[2599 旁白 neutral]]
If there was really a hidden treasure, why hadn't Liu Xin, who held the Myriad Spirits Banner for so many years, gone after it? He was most likely afraid that Chen Xinan would turn the tables on him! [[2600 旁白 neutral]]
This person had a deep background and unpredictable methods, completely different from someone like Liu Xin. Even as a banner spirit, he could not be fully trusted. [[2601 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Xinan's expression changed slightly. "Then why did you summon me?" [[2602 陈信安 angry]]
"Just for an experiment." [[2603 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's tone was calm, but Chen Xinan sensed danger from it and quickly said, "Wait, wait... I also know where to find a Foundation Establishment opportunity..." [[2604 陈信安 fearful]]
Boom! [[2605 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, Lv Yang acted without hesitation, ignoring the so-called Foundation Establishment opportunity and directly shattering the true spirit of Chen Xinan that was refined in the Myriad Spirits Banner. [[2606 旁白 neutral]]
"No—!" [[2607 陈信安 fearful]]
"The master of Sky Mending Peak targeted me so much in my last life. This life, I'll beat his son to death to vent my anger. After a few more lives, when I reach Foundation Establishment, I'll go and kill him too!" [[2608 旁白 angry]]
Lv Yang's face was calm. [[2609 旁白 neutral]]
With the [Hundred Lives Book], his Dao heart was incredibly firm and unyielding. No matter how powerful his opponent was, he was confident he would win in the end. [[2610 旁白 neutral]]
As for the Foundation Establishment opportunity... what a coincidence, he knew of one too! [[2611 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Xinan's presence completely vanished, his soul scattered. Then, Lv Yang put away the Myriad Spirits Banner, cleaned up the scene, and began to wait silently. [[2612 旁白 neutral]]
A short while later, Sky Mending Peak shook violently! [[2613 旁白 surprised]]
A familiar pressure appeared, as if Mount Tai was falling on him. Lv Yang immediately put on a fearful expression. He knew exactly what it was. [[2614 旁白 neutral]]
It was the gaze of a Foundation Establishment master. [[2615 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, by completely killing Chen Xinan, he had alerted the master of Sky Mending Peak, who was probably now trying to deduce the killer through karma. [[2616 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, he should be discovered in the next second. [[2617 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang waited in his cave for half an hour, but even after the pressure disappeared, the master of Sky Mending Peak did not appear before him. [[2618 旁白 neutral]]
"...It really works!" [[2619 吕阳 happy]]
He can't find me! [[2620 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang's face remained calm, but he was laughing inside. With this confirmation, he could finally practice the Nine Transformations Dragon Art with peace of mind in this life. [[2621 旁白 happy]]
For his next actions, Lv Yang repeated what he did in his previous lives. [[2622 旁白 neutral]]
First, he hyped up the Substitute Death Yin Puppet to earn contribution points, then hyped up Yun Miaoqing to hide his sword art and sword pellet, and then bought a large number of spirit pills to begin closed-door cultivation. [[2623 旁白 neutral]]
Ten years later. [[2624 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, generations of disciples rose and fell. The storms of the past had calmed down, and the Holy Sect continued to develop steadily. [[2625 旁白 neutral]]
Only today seemed to be a little different. [[2626 旁白 neutral]]
Heaven and earth resonated, and the cave where Lv Yang was cultivating became a vortex, with vast spiritual energy pouring in from all directions like a flood. [[2627 旁白 neutral]]
"This is... a celestial phenomenon!?" [[2628 陌生男1 surprised]]
"A Senior Brother has condensed his Qi seed and broken through to the late stage of Qi Refining!" [[2629 陌生男1 surprised]]
Even in the Chu Sheng Sect, late-stage Qi Refining cultivators were considered high-level workers and would not be easily used as materials. They also had a certain degree of autonomy. [[2630 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, within Sky Mending Peak, the disciples who toiled for their daily survival saw the celestial phenomenon of Lv Yang's breakthrough. While they were amazed, hidden beneath was a stronger feeling of envy, jealousy, and even resentment of "why isn't it me". [[2631 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, inside the cave, Lv Yang also opened his eyes. [[2632 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, a flash of white light seemed to pass through the dark room, bright and piercing! [[2633 旁白 neutral]]
"The term 'bottleneck' is truly fitting." [[2634 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's cultivation speed in this life was the same as in his previous one. He reached the sixth level of Qi Refining, the peak of the middle stage, in just three years, but was stuck at the bottleneck for seven years. [[2635 旁白 neutral]]
This was only because he had broken through to the late stage of Qi Refining once before and had the experience. [[2636 旁白 neutral]]
Otherwise, this time would have been even longer. One can imagine why so many cultivators get stuck at this step, unable to advance in their entire lives. [[2637 旁白 neutral]]
After breaking through, Lv Yang did not rush out. Instead, he sat quietly for three more days until he had completely mastered the changes in his true qi, body, and spiritual sense before getting up. [[2638 旁白 neutral]]
He opened the [Hundred Lives Book] panel: [[2639 旁白 neutral]]
[Name: Lv Yang] [[2640 旁白 neutral]]
[Age: 28] [[2641 旁白 neutral]]
[Cultivation: Qi Refining Level 7 (Late Stage), 9th-Grade Array Master] [[2642 旁白 neutral]]
[Talents: Dual Cultivation Prodigy (White), Quite Skillful (Purple)] [[2643 旁白 neutral]]
[Technique: Nine Transformations Dragon Art (Level 7)] [[2644 旁白 neutral]]
[Abilities: Divine Thunder Sword Art (Adept), Secret Scroll of Array Treasures (Perfected), Life-Taking Curse (Perfected), Heavenly Demon Blood-Devouring Divine Light (Perfected), Qi-Concealing Art (Perfected)] [[2645 旁白 neutral]]
[Treasures: Blood Sun Sword Pellet (High-Grade Magic Tool), Innate Primal-Unity Qi Myriad Spirits Banner (High-Grade Magic Tool)] [[2646 旁白 neutral]]
[Hundred Lives Book Pages: 95] [[2647 旁白 neutral]]
Although both were at the late stage of Qi Refining, the Lv Yang of this life was much stronger than in his previous life. Their true qi was not on the same level; a fight would be a complete victory for him. [[2648 旁白 neutral]]
Especially after mastering the Heavenly Demon Blood-Devouring Divine Light, combined with the Blood River Sword Array Diagram, even if an opponent was also at the late stage of Qi Refining, once they were trapped in his array, they would surely die unless they knew about his abilities beforehand and had prepared a counter. [[2649 旁白 neutral]]
"But it's still not safe enough." [[2650 吕阳 neutral]]
The Heavenly Demon Blood-Devouring Divine Light was powerful, but it was an ability that ordinary disciples could find. Who knew what powerful abilities the true disciples had? [[2651 旁白 neutral]]
"True disciples... I wonder if I have a chance?" [[2652 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked expectant. With the divine talisman concealing his karma in this life, his identity was clean. Generally, he would be an easy target for recruitment. [[2653 旁白 neutral]]
After all, even for a Foundation Establishment master, a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator was a good subordinate. [[2654 旁白 neutral]]
Moreover, unlike his previous life, he had not turned into a blood shadow, and his path to immortality was not cut off. No matter how you looked at it, he should be worth investing in. [[2655 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, Lv Yang had already made up his mind. [[2656 旁白 neutral]]
If a Foundation Establishment master really offered him a place, he would not refuse, even if it was the master of Sky Mending Peak. He would take the benefits first; the grudge could be settled in the next life. [[2657 旁白 neutral]]
A man's pride is worth gold, and today is the day to cash it in! [[2658 旁白 happy]]
