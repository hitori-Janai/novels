Chapter 35: Senior Brother Zhao and I Are Fated to Meet! [[2730 旁白 neutral]]
In the life before his last one, about twenty years from Lv Yang's current time, the Sect would launch a war to wipe out a righteous sect. [[2731 旁白 neutral]]
The righteous sect that was destroyed was called the "Divine Martial Sect." [[2732 旁白 neutral]]
In that life, Zhao Xuhe eventually reached the peak of Qi Refining and, together with Fairy Feixia, became a steward of the Sect's marketplace in the outer world. [[2733 旁白 neutral]]
That marketplace was located at Skull Mountain, near the Divine Martial Sect. [[2734 旁白 neutral]]
Before the war, the Sect used the marketplace as a cover to transport a large amount of supplies. It was said that the two of them found a Foundation Establishment item at that time. [[2735 旁白 neutral]]
After that, when the war began, the two of them distinguished themselves and earned great merit. They exchanged their points for another Foundation Establishment item from the Sect, then asked an alchemist to combine the two items into a "Foundation Establishment Pill," giving them a chance to break through to Foundation Establishment. [[2736 旁白 neutral]]
Although they ultimately failed, the opportunity was real. [[2737 旁白 neutral]]
"Zhao Xuhe and I both cultivate the Nine Transformations Dragon Art. If he could attempt Foundation Establishment, maybe I have a chance too. It's worth a try no matter what!" [[2738 吕阳 neutral]]
Three more days passed. [[2739 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang was meditating in his cave residence when suddenly, a Human-Faced Owl flew to the entrance. Its beak opened and closed, releasing a clear and pleasant voice: [[2740 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv, please come to my cave residence for a meeting." [[2741 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
It was Fairy Feixia. [[2742 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Lv Yang's gaze shifted slightly. He immediately rode a beam of sword light toward Fairy Feixia's cave residence and was led to a tea pavilion with a beautiful landscape. [[2743 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the pavilion, Fairy Feixia was brewing tea. Her movements were graceful as she poured spiritual water, heated it with true fire, and steeped the tea leaves. The process was a delight to watch. Arriving at just the right moment, Lv Yang smelled a delicate tea fragrance that refreshed his mind and even stimulated his spiritual sense. [[2744 旁白 neutral]]
"Please have a seat, Junior Brother." [[2745 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia looked up. After Lv Yang sat down, she got straight to the point, "I've come to find you, Junior Brother, because the association has sent a reply." [[2746 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
"Oh?" Lv Yang deliberately showed an excited expression. "Has my divine ability arrived?" [[2747 吕阳 happy]]
"That's right." Fairy Feixia smiled faintly. "Second Senior Brother has sent the list of divine abilities. You may now choose one to cultivate." [[2748 飞霞仙子 happy]]
"Thank you, Senior Sister!" [[2749 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang cupped his hands, took the jade slip with the list, and opened it. He was momentarily blinded by the dense list of divine abilities. After reading it carefully, he cursed inwardly. [[2750 旁白 angry]]
He had seen most of these divine abilities in the Library Pavilion on Sky Mending Peak. However, the versions in the library were incomplete, far less powerful than the complete versions on this list. They looked similar, but the difference was like heaven and earth. It showed just how tightly the Sect controlled its resources. [[2751 旁白 angry]]
It was simply outrageous. [[2752 旁白 angry]]
If he hadn't joined the Three Rivers Association, signed an indenture contract, and gained the backing of a True Disciple, he probably would have never seen these complete techniques in his life. [[2753 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, Lv Yang's eyes suddenly lit up. [[2754 旁白 surprised]]
He had found a familiar name on the list: the Heavenly Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light. Or rather, its complete version! [[2755 旁白 surprised]]
The Great Yin Corpse-Shedding True Method! [[2756 旁白 surprised]]
"Refine the body with Great Yin, better than a nine-revolution pill. Your form becomes dignified and solemn, your face like a spiritual cloud. Ascend to the Great Ultimate Palace, receive the scripture, and become a True Person." [[2757 旁白 neutral]]
This was a great divine ability! [[2758 旁白 surprised]]
The Heavenly Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light was just the first step. Once fully mastered, one could transcend the five elements, become impervious to weapons, and even be known as a "Corpse-Liberated Immortal." [[2759 旁白 neutral]]
"This is it!" [[2760 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang made his decision immediately. He copied the contents of the Great Yin Corpse-Shedding True Method and then turned to Fairy Feixia, cupping his hands respectfully. [[2761 旁白 neutral]]
"Now that this is settled, is there anything else you need, Senior Sister?" [[2762 吕阳 neutral]]
"To be honest, Junior Brother," Fairy Feixia said with a light laugh, "I'm planning to apply for an external assignment to oversee the Skull Mountain marketplace, and I'm short on capable assistants." [[2763 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
It's here! [[2764 旁白 surprised]]
Lv Yang wasn't surprised by Fairy Feixia's invitation. After giving him a reward, it was only natural for the Three Rivers Association to ask him to do something. [[2765 旁白 neutral]]
"If you don't mind, Senior Sister, I am willing to go with you." [[2766 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang agreed without any hesitation. [[2767 旁白 neutral]]
After all, this was about a Foundation Establishment opportunity. Even if Fairy Feixia hadn't invited him, Lv Yang was already planning to take a mission from the Hall of Meritorious Deeds to go to the Skull Mountain marketplace. [[2768 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing how decisive Lv Yang was, the look in Fairy Feixia's eyes grew more satisfied. "Junior Brother is just as I thought, a person with a firm heart for the Dao. Ordinary disciples like us have no future if we just stay in the Sect. Our only hope is to go out and seek opportunities." [[2769 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
"Only by burning our bridges and disregarding life and death can we hope to reach Foundation Establishment!" [[2770 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
After their conversation, Lv Yang noticed that Fairy Feixia's gaze toward him had become warmer. She clearly saw him as a like-minded person. [[2771 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't wrong about disregarding life and death. [[2772 旁白 neutral]]
But it wasn't because I've burned my bridges. It's because I have the Hundred Lives Book. I'm not afraid of failure. If I die, I'll just start over! [[2773 吕阳 neutral]]
Ten days later, on the sky-soaring flying boat to Skull Mountain. [[2774 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang descended in a flash of light, landing steadily on the deck of the flying boat. After greeting Fairy Feixia, he quietly blended into the crowd below. [[2775 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't plan to be too conspicuous on this trip to Skull Mountain. [[2776 旁白 neutral]]
He preferred to be an unremarkable face in the crowd rather than the center of attention. The best would be to frown and silently retreat behind everyone else. [[2777 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, many cultivators had gathered on the flying boat. [[2778 旁白 neutral]]
Besides Fairy Feixia, the leaders were two cultivators at the seventh layer of Qi Refining. He even recognized one of them: Lu Yuanchun, a disciple of the Sky Mending Peak Master. [[2779 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmph. Sooner or later, I'll settle the score with him." [[2780 吕阳 angry]]
A cold glint flashed in Lv Yang's eyes before disappearing. He looked around again. Since Lu Yuanchun was here, would Zhao Xuhe be here too? [[2781 吕阳 neutral]]
The Foundation Establishment opportunity of this life might fall to him after all! [[2782 吕阳 happy]]
Sure enough, after a quick scan, Lv Yang spotted Zhao Xuhe in a remote corner of the boat, drinking spiritual wine by himself. [[2783 旁白 neutral]]
However, the current Zhao Xuhe looked several times more dejected than in previous lives. Lv Yang wasn't surprised. In this life, Zhao Xuhe couldn't find him, so his destined opportunity had vanished. He also went bankrupt from speculating on the death-substitute puppets, and his lover, Fairy Qingchen, had surely left him. He had lost both his love and his fortune. [[2784 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang was already impressed that he hadn't jumped off Sky Mending Peak yet. [[2785 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Zhao? Is that you, Senior Brother Zhao?" [[2786 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang approached him, putting on a look of pleasant surprise. "I can't believe I ran into you here, Senior Brother. We must be fated to meet!" [[2787 吕阳 happy]]
"Huh? Who are you?" [[2788 赵旭河 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe was stunned for a moment before his cultivator's memory finally recognized Lv Yang. He was dumbfounded. "Junior Brother... Lv? You're at the middle stage of Qi Refining?" [[2789 赵旭河 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe had truly fallen on hard times. He couldn't see through Lv Yang's Qi-concealing art, so he didn't know his true cultivation level. Even so, the middle stage of Qi Refining was enough to shock him. Ten years ago, Lv Yang had been an insignificant character in his eyes. [[2790 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe felt even more depressed. [[2791 旁白 sad]]
"Hmph, are you here to laugh at me too? Get lost!" [[2792 赵旭河 angry]]
"Why would you say that, Senior Brother?" Lv Yang looked puzzled and quickly added, "I have always remembered your kindness from the past. How could I possibly laugh at you?" [[2793 吕阳 neutral]]
Kindness? What kindness? [[2794 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe was stunned again. Then he remembered that he had helped Lv Yang secure a loan a long time ago. That counts as kindness? Are there really such fools in the world? [[2795 赵旭河 neutral]]
Just as Zhao Xuhe was about to say something sarcastic... [[2796 旁白 neutral]]
"I see your cultivation is still at the sixth layer of Qi Refining. If you don't mind, Senior Brother, I have a spiritual pill here that can help boost your cultivation." [[2797 吕阳 neutral]]
"This isn't appropriate, is it?" [[2798 赵旭河 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe blankly accepted the spiritual pill that Lv Yang forced into his hand. For some reason, as he looked at Lv Yang, he actually felt a sense of closeness! [[2799 赵旭河 surprised]]
It was as if the two had known each other in a past life. [[2800 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be that we are truly fated? [[2801 赵旭河 surprised]]
Happy New Year! [[2802 旁白 happy]]
