Chapter 11: The Life-Killing Curse [[873 旁白 neutral]]
The next day, Lv Yang waited in his cave-dwelling for the entire day. [[874 旁白 neutral]]
No one came. [[875 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if the three men in black were not disciples of the Chu Sheng Sect at all. Their deaths caused no stir, and no one even came to check on the situation. [[876 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang sighed again. He didn't doubt that the sect, which possessed the life lamps of all its disciples, was unaware of the three men's deaths. Thinking about it now, he feared that "mutual killing among disciples" was an unwritten rule. As long as it wasn't made a huge, public incident, no one would investigate. [[877 旁白 neutral]]
After all, the ways of the Demonic Sect were treacherous and hard to predict. [[878 旁白 neutral]]
Someone died. Maybe it was to silence them, maybe for profit, or maybe they knew something they shouldn't have. What if an investigation actually uncovered something? [[879 旁白 neutral]]
So, it was better not to investigate. [[880 旁白 neutral]]
"As expected of the sect." [[881 吕阳 neutral]]
After sighing, Lv Yang relaxed and began to collect his spoils of war. [[882 旁白 neutral]]
First were the disciple tokens. To Lv Yang's shock, the tokens of the three men in black contained a total of 400 contribution points, an unusually large amount. [[883 旁白 surprised]]
"So they were repeat offenders." [[884 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang frowned and searched again. Besides some miscellaneous items, only a secret manual called "Qi-Concealing Art" caught his interest. [[885 旁白 neutral]]
In Lv Yang's view, these three men were very skilled at concealing their true qi. If he hadn't broken through in his cultivation, with his true qi and spiritual sense making a huge leap, he probably wouldn't have noticed them sneaking in. This showed how powerful the "Qi-Concealing Art" was; it must have been their hidden trump card. [[886 旁白 neutral]]
"More importantly, this has nothing to do with the sect!" [[887 吕阳 happy]]
Sect techniques were only recorded on disciple tokens, but the "Qi-Concealing Art" was a physical manual. This meant it was likely the three men's own fortunate discovery. [[888 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, he didn't have to worry about the sect having a way to counter it. [[889 旁白 neutral]]
"It's like getting a pillow just when you're sleepy. What a good death!" [[890 吕阳 happy]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang sincerely prepared their bodies for burial, dug a pit, and buried them, giving them a final resting place. [[891 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a thought suddenly crossed his mind: [[892 旁白 neutral]]
"This 'Qi-Concealing Art' is so clever and not from the sect. Where did they get it? Could there be an even greater opportunity behind it?" [[893 吕阳 neutral]]
Instantly, Lv Yang's mind started racing. [[894 旁白 neutral]]
But he quickly restrained his greed, and his eyes became calm again. "No rush, no rush. Maybe I can befriend these three in the next life." [[895 吕阳 neutral]]
There will always be a chance! [[896 旁白 happy]]
After laying the three to rest, Lv Yang took out his disciple token and began to look up the materials needed to refine a Sword Pellet, which Yun Miaoqing had told him about earlier. [[897 旁白 neutral]]
"To refine a Sword Pellet, one needs to gather three taels of Gold Essence, three taels of Jade Marrow, two taels of Cinnabar, and two taels of Sword Qi, for a total of ten taels. Then, using True Fire and Divine Water for forging and cooling to remove impurities, one must slowly refine it with a secret sword art, allowing it to merge with the refiner's essence, qi, and spirit. Only then can it be truly completed." [[898 旁白 neutral]]
As Lv Yang recalled the method for refining the Sword Pellet, he browsed the item catalog. [[899 旁白 neutral]]
But the more he looked, the uglier his expression became. [[900 旁白 angry]]
"Gold Essence, Jade Marrow, Cinnabar, and Sword Qi are all priced at 100 contribution points per tael. True Water is 500 contribution points for a gourd, and True Fire is 500 contribution points for a single strand." [[901 旁白 neutral]]
"2000 contribution points!?" [[902 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang clenched his teeth. He had heard from Yun Miaoqing that disciples of the Yushu Sword Pavilion received a Sword Pellet from their masters after breaking through to Qi Refining. [[903 旁白 neutral]]
But here in the Chu Sheng Sect, it cost 2000 contribution points? [[904 旁白 angry]]
A normal disciple would have to work like an animal for the sect for twenty years, without eating or drinking, just to gather that many points! [[905 旁白 angry]]
Damn this Demonic Sect! [[906 旁白 angry]]
This outrageous price instantly extinguished the pride Lv Yang felt from his small windfall, reminding him once again that he was a poor man. [[907 旁白 sad]]
"In that case, these 400 contribution points are a bit useless." [[908 旁白 neutral]]
According to Lv Yang's plan, he would choose to inherit his cultivation level in his next life, so he couldn't take any items with him from this one. [[909 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, no matter what good things he bought with these 400 contribution points, they would be meaningless to him. [[910 旁白 neutral]]
As for his cultivation, the middle stage of Qi Refining was completely different from the initial stage. Even if he spent all 400 points, it wouldn't be enough to break through to the fifth layer of Qi Refining. [[911 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems I can only exchange them for techniques." [[912 旁白 neutral]]
After all, unlike treasures, techniques and abilities were knowledge that could be carried into the next life. Thinking of this, Lv Yang immediately left his cave-dwelling and headed for the Library Pavilion. [[913 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, it's you, kid?" [[914 老人 surprised]]
The old man at the entrance of the Library Pavilion actually remembered Lv Yang and looked surprised. "Are you here to exchange for another technique? Looks like you've struck it rich." [[915 老人 neutral]]
"I hope your words bring me luck, Senior Brother." [[916 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang cupped his hands and walked into the Library Pavilion. This time, his goal was clear: to find a powerful, life-risking ability. [[917 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, Lv Yang locked onto his target. [[918 旁白 neutral]]
"Life-Killing Curse: 300 contribution points." [[919 旁白 neutral]]
This ability was very special, similar to a Buddhist vow of silence. It required the cultivator to nurture a breath of killing intent in their chest, refining it day and night with their true qi until it was bound to their life. [[920 旁白 neutral]]
When not in use, one could speak normally. But when used, one would open their mouth and utter "Kill!". The full force of the killing intent, along with one's life force, would erupt in an instant, shattering souls and spirits. But once the killing intent was spent, the user would also die. It was a technique to perish together with the enemy. [[921 旁白 neutral]]
"Excellent. It can kill enemies and also kill myself. It's perfect for me!" [[922 吕阳 happy]]
With The Hundred Lives Book, what Lv Yang feared most was not death, but being unable to die. The book could not be activated manually; it only worked when he died. [[923 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, he desperately needed a way to kill himself. [[924 旁白 neutral]]
After exchanging the technique from the Library Pavilion, Lv Yang immediately sat cross-legged and began to comprehend the art. [[925 旁白 neutral]]
"The Life-Killing Curse stores killing intent in the chest. The most important thing is this breath of killing intent. The higher its quality, the greater the power of the curse when unleashed." [[926 旁白 neutral]]
"It is said that when Heaven unleashes its killing intent, the stars shift. When the Earth unleashes its killing intent, dragons and snakes rise from the ground. When a person unleashes their killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned. Therefore, there are three types of killing intent: Heavenly, Earthly, and Human. Heavenly and Earthly killing intent are seen once in a century. Only Human killing intent is common, with the aura from weapons being the best." [[927 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the Library Pavilion, Lv Yang began to refine his killing intent. [[928 旁白 neutral]]
"Good thing I have the materials ready..." [[929 吕阳 happy]]
The so-called human killing intent was mostly taken from weapons used by those with murderous intent. As it happened, he still had the weapons from the three men in black. [[930 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang directly extracted the killing intent from them, refining it into his body bit by bit. [[931 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, Lv Yang felt as if a thousand knives were scraping his bones and cutting his flesh from inside his chest. The pain was unbearable, but he kept his lips tightly sealed, not daring to open his mouth. [[932 旁白 neutral]]
This was the critical moment of refinement. If he opened his mouth now, the intent would leak, and he would die instantly! [[933 旁白 fearful]]
After a long time, Lv Yang finally felt the killing intent in his chest stabilize and connect completely with his true qi. With a single thought, it would erupt. [[934 旁白 neutral]]
"I wonder how powerful it is." [[935 吕阳 neutral]]
Thinking of this, a look of anticipation appeared on Lv Yang's face. He decided he had to use the Life-Killing Curse once before he died in this life to see its power. [[936 旁白 neutral]]
When he returned to the entrance of the Library Pavilion, Lv Yang was surprised to find the old man cursing loudly. [[937 旁白 neutral]]
"Damn it, that lucky bastard..." [[938 老人 angry]]
The old man held his disciple token, his wrinkled hands trembling uncontrollably. His old face was twisted with an unreadable emotion. [[939 旁白 angry]]
Lv Yang walked over and asked curiously, "Senior Brother? What happened?" [[940 吕阳 neutral]]
"What happened?" The old man's eyes widened with rage. He threw the disciple token on the ground and sneered, "Everyone is talking about it. See for yourself." [[941 老人 angry]]
As soon as he finished speaking, the old man lay back down in his rocking chair, sulking. [[942 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang was confused until he also opened his disciple token and saw the latest news. Only then did he understand what had happened. [[943 旁白 neutral]]
"The Merit Pool lottery finally has a winner!" [[944 旁白 neutral]]
"The Colorful Merit Fish was won by a new disciple, Xiao Shiye. A Perfected Being publicly awarded him the grand prize of one billion. After receiving the prize, Xiao Shiye went into seclusion and his whereabouts are unknown!" [[945 旁白 neutral]]
