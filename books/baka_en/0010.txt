Chapter 10: A Dark Night for Murder [[788 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the cave residence, in a quiet room. [[789 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang sat cross-legged and began to break through to the next level. [[790 旁白 neutral]]
With the spirit pill in his stomach, and after constantly absorbing energy from Yun Miaoqing for the past half-month, his cultivation level quickly reached its limit. [[791 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom!" [[792 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, as if stepping up to a new level, Lv Yang felt a powerful True Qi roar inside him like a rushing river, greatly boosting his spirits. [[793 旁白 neutral]]
Second level of Qi Refining! [[794 旁白 neutral]]
"There are no bottlenecks before the fourth level of Qi Refining. As long as I have enough resources, I can reach it with time. But it seems I'm out of time now." [[795 吕阳 fearful]]
The existence of Fairy Qingchen gave Lv Yang a sense of crisis. [[796 旁白 fearful]]
He couldn't forget that in his previous life, Liu Xin had openly charged into his cave. If Liu Xin could do it, why couldn't Fairy Qingchen? [[797 旁白 fearful]]
Even the cave residence isn't safe! [[798 旁白 fearful]]
"The only thing I can truly rely on is my own cultivation and strength!" [[799 吕阳 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang gritted his teeth, took out all his remaining spirit pills, and swallowed them all at once. Then, he called for Yun Miaoqing again. [[800 旁白 neutral]]
Although this was wasteful, and at least thirty percent of the pills' effects were lost, it was the fastest way to increase his cultivation. In Lv Yang's view, as long as he could break through to the third level, the pills were well worth it. [[801 旁白 neutral]]
Time flew by, and three days and nights passed in a flash. [[802 旁白 neutral]]
During this time, Lv Yang didn't eat or drink. He absorbed so much energy from Yun Miaoqing that she became as limp as mud. Finally, he felt himself break through a thin barrier. [[803 旁白 neutral]]
"...I did it!" [[804 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang looked inside his body and felt a vast True Qi, like a great river, flowing through his meridians. It seemed immense, but he knew he couldn't advance any further. [[805 旁白 neutral]]
At first glance, it seemed his cultivation had reached a state of perfection. [[806 旁白 neutral]]
"So this is the bottleneck..." [[807 吕阳 neutral]]
One step further was the fourth level of Qi Refining, a leap from the early stage to the middle stage. In the Chu Sheng Sect, disciples at this level could hold positions of responsibility. [[808 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang didn't stop or dare to relax. He directly took out the strand of Innate True Qi. [[809 旁白 neutral]]
"Continue!" [[810 吕阳 neutral]]
He activated the Innate True Qi, then controlled his own True Qi to swallow it whole. He watched as his True Qi surged, flowing into his Dantian like a hundred rivers returning to the sea. [[811 旁白 neutral]]
As the Innate True Qi was consumed, Lv Yang felt the bottleneck that had trapped him, once as immovable as a mountain, slowly weaken. When the Innate True Qi was completely used up, the invisible barrier melted like ice and snow, collapsing in an instant! [[812 旁白 neutral]]
In the dim, quiet room, Lv Yang suddenly opened his eyes. [[813 旁白 neutral]]
His gaze was as sharp as a torch, and the dark room seemed to brighten. [[814 旁白 neutral]]
Another day and night had passed in the blink of an eye. From this moment on, Lv Yang's strength was worlds apart from what it had been just a few days ago! [[815 旁白 neutral]]
"The middle stage of Qi Refining is completely different from the early stage." Lv Yang felt the changes in his body with a look of joy. "If the True Qi in the early stage was a small river, then the middle stage is a vast sea! It's more than ten times stronger! Only at this point can I be considered a true cultivator..." [[816 吕阳 happy]]
In the early stage of Qi Refining, True Qi was limited, and every magical art had to be used sparingly. [[817 旁白 neutral]]
But after advancing to the middle stage, he no longer had to worry about that. He could use common magical arts at will, and the consumed True Qi could be restored in just a few breaths. [[818 旁白 neutral]]
"Excellent! Excellent!" [[819 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang walked out of the quiet room and took out a Bone Jade Sword. With a thought, the sword instantly split into ten beams of light, enveloping the entire cave. [[820 旁白 neutral]]
Whoosh—! [[821 旁白 neutral]]
The sword lights whistled sharply. Lv Yang performed the Divine Firmament Sword Control Art, his body merging with the light. He felt an incredible sense of freedom and satisfaction. [[822 旁白 neutral]]
"I really have to thank Liu Xin!" [[823 吕阳 happy]]
"Without this strand of 'Innate True Qi' that was perfectly compatible with me, I would have never been able to break through. I would have been stuck at the third level of Qi Refining for years!" [[824 吕阳 happy]]
"No wonder Liu Xin gave up the Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra to practice that Innate Dao Scripture." [[825 吕阳 neutral]]
"Unfortunately, his intentions were corrupt. He used people as medicine. Who knows how many he killed after obtaining it? It was all because of the Innate Dao Scripture." [[826 吕阳 neutral]]
"Such a邪功 should be mine to use!" [[827 吕阳 angry]]
A sudden greed emerged in Lv Yang's heart. [[828 旁白 neutral]]
"No rush, be patient... Maybe in the next life, there's still plenty of time..." [[829 吕阳 neutral]]
As Lv Yang was thinking, his eyebrows suddenly raised. He looked toward the entrance of the cave because one of his sword lights had just been triggered. [[830 旁白 surprised]]
"Someone's here?" [[831 吕阳 surprised]]
A cold glint flashed in Lv Yang's eyes. He felt a bit of relief that he had made the decisive choice to break through quickly, even if it meant wasting resources. [[832 旁白 neutral]]
If he hadn't, he would still be in seclusion, completely unaware of the outside world. Wouldn't that have been certain death? [[833 旁白 fearful]]
"I must take this as a warning." [[834 吕阳 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang quickly concealed his newly advanced aura. The killing intent in his heart grew stronger, like a hunter waiting for his prey. [[835 旁白 neutral]]
"Click." [[836 旁白 neutral]]
With a soft sound, the cave door was silently pried open. Three figures slipped in one after another. [[837 旁白 neutral]]
The three were dressed in black and wore masks, their True Qi completely hidden. Hiding in the dark, Lv Yang was impressed. If he hadn't broken through and reached a higher cultivation level, he might not have seen through their disguise and would have thought they were just three ordinary people. Their skill in concealing their aura was truly remarkable. [[838 旁白 neutral]]
"..." [[839 旁白 neutral]]
The leader of the three men in black gave a hand signal without speaking. The others understood and quickly spread out to search the cave. [[840 旁白 neutral]]
"Whoosh!" [[841 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, the man in black at the front saw a blur, and a brilliant sword light, whistling loudly, appeared right before his eyes! [[842 旁白 neutral]]
"Not good!" [[843 陌生男1 fearful]]
The man's face changed drastically. He had no time to defend himself and could only roll to the side to dodge. But no matter how fast a person is, how can they be faster than a flying sword? [[844 旁白 fearful]]
Swish—! [[845 旁白 neutral]]
The sword light flashed, and a pillar of blood shot into the air! [[846 旁白 neutral]]
"Middle stage of Qi Refining!?" [[847 陌生男2 surprised]]
The leader of the men in black was clearly experienced. He immediately identified Lv Yang's cultivation level from the power and quality of the sword light and cried out in shock. [[848 旁白 surprised]]
At the same time, he was cursing inwardly. [[849 旁白 angry]]
Damn you, Qingchen! [[850 陌生男2 angry]]
This is a newly-admitted disciple? An easy target? [[851 陌生男2 angry]]
And this Lv Yang, who could have easily crushed the three of them with his middle-stage cultivation, resorted to deception and a sneak attack? [[852 陌生男2 angry]]
What a dog! [[853 陌生男2 angry]]
Seeing the sword light approach, the leader formed a hand seal to create a protective barrier of light while yelling, "A misunderstanding! This is all a misunderstanding..." [[854 陌生男2 fearful]]
"Boom!" [[855 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang paid him no mind. The sword light slashed horizontally, nearly shattering the man's protective barrier. At the same time, a wave of True Qi roared out from the darkness, like a tidal wave, finally forming a giant hand with clear palm lines that grabbed another man in black. [[856 旁白 neutral]]
Splat! [[857 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, the giant hand squeezed hard, crushing the second man in black. His bones snapped, and a mix of red and white splattered everywhere. [[858 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing such a brutal scene, the leader's eyes widened in fury and disbelief. [[859 旁白 fearful]]
Meanwhile, Lv Yang looked on with a satisfied expression. [[860 旁白 happy]]
"This Innate True Qi Great Hand Seal is quite good. It's not very powerful against someone at the same level, but it's perfect for crushing those at a lower level." [[861 吕阳 happy]]
As he thought, the sword lights did not stop. [[862 旁白 neutral]]
More than ten sword lights whistled through the cave, and the Bone Jade Sword teleported between them, giving the leader no chance to breathe. [[863 旁白 neutral]]
After a few breaths, the leader was exhausted. Lv Yang found an opening and, with a slash of his sword, another pillar of blood shot into the sky. [[864 旁白 neutral]]
"Whew! That was dangerous..." [[865 吕阳 fearful]]
After finishing, Lv Yang finally let out a sigh of relief. Looking at the corpses and flesh on the ground, he felt a lingering fear as he recalled the fight. [[866 旁白 fearful]]
Strictly speaking, this was the first time he had killed someone. [[867 旁白 neutral]]
Although he had practiced the smooth combo of a sneak attack countless times in private, this was the first time he had used it in a real battle. [[868 旁白 neutral]]
"Honestly, my combat experience is far worse than these three. At the same level, I couldn't even beat one of them, let alone three. But by using a sneak attack to gain the upper hand and force them into a contest of pure power, I could easily suppress them with my higher cultivation." [[869 吕阳 neutral]]
"This shows that fighting with raw power is worse than fighting with techniques, and fighting with techniques is worse than fighting with cultivation level..." [[870 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang reviewed and summarized the valuable experience of this battle, thinking about how he could improve, certain that it would be useful in his next life. [[871 吕阳 neutral]]
