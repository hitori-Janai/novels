Chapter 37: The True Art of Supreme Yin Form-Shedding and Corpse Liberation [[2879 旁白 neutral]]
"This 'True Art of Supreme Yin Form-Shedding and Corpse Liberation' is a bit difficult." [[2880 吕阳 neutral]]
After a night of seclusion, Lv Yang frowned at the secret manual of divine arts before him. "A great divine art... it cannot be performed without immense magical power. It is the pinnacle of divine arts." [[2881 旁白 neutral]]
The so-called "great divine art" was not actually a rank of divine art, but a method of application. [[2882 旁白 neutral]]
In short, combining several compatible high-level divine arts to unleash dozens of times their power was called a great divine art. [[2883 旁白 neutral]]
The 'True Art of Supreme Yin Form-Shedding and Corpse Liberation' was just like this. To master this great divine art, one had to first learn three high-level divine arts: the Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light, the Profound Yin Form-Seizing Great Art, and the Taiwei Imperial Edict Treasure Talisman. Each of these three was extremely difficult to cultivate and could not be achieved without great fortune. [[2884 旁白 neutral]]
This was a common characteristic of all great divine arts. [[2885 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't something you could master just by wanting to. It depended on one's comprehension, fortune, and merit. Lacking any of these would only lead to failure. [[2886 旁白 neutral]]
Take the first divine art, the Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light, for example. [[2887 旁白 neutral]]
This divine art alone had stumped countless cultivators. After all, cultivating by skinning oneself was equivalent to cutting off one's own path to immortality. Even if mastered, it was meaningless. [[2888 旁白 neutral]]
As for the second divine art, the Profound Yin Form-Seizing Great Art, it didn't have such severe side effects. The difficulty was mainly due to an external item. To master it, one needed a 'Profound Female Supreme Yin Treasure Jade' as a medium. Without this wondrous treasure, one could not succeed, no matter how high their cultivation or comprehension was. [[2889 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, the 'Profound Female Supreme Yin Treasure Jade' was extremely rare. [[2890 旁白 neutral]]
How rare? One sentence could describe it: it was not in the Chu Sheng Sect's exchange list. You couldn't buy it even with contribution points. [[2891 旁白 neutral]]
Even with the vast resources of the Chu Sheng Sect, they did not possess such a wondrous item. [[2892 旁白 neutral]]
It was clear that mastering this divine art depended entirely on a cultivator's fortune and luck. Without that luck, searching the entire world would be futile. [[2893 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, Lv Yang only gave it a glance before decisively giving up on it and turning his attention to the third divine art, the Taiwei Imperial Edict Treasure Talisman. [[2894 旁白 neutral]]
However, to his frustration, although this divine art required no precious external items and had no major side effects, it was incredibly difficult. [[2895 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang studied it for a whole night with little to show for it. [[2896 旁白 neutral]]
"It's a bit like a formation, and a bit like a talisman, yet it's classified as a divine art. Whether I can learn it depends entirely on comprehension. If I can't, I can't." [[2897 吕阳 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang scratched his head again, feeling unconvinced. [[2898 旁白 neutral]]
"I managed to overcome something as difficult as formations. How long can a mere divine art stop me? At worst, I'll spend another twenty years on it. I'll learn you sooner or later!" [[2899 吕阳 angry]]
The reason the 'True Art of Supreme Yin Form-Shedding and Corpse Liberation' made Lv Yang so determined was that this great divine art was simply too tempting. He couldn't give it up. [[2900 旁白 neutral]]
Not to mention how powerful the Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light was, the Profound Yin Form-Seizing Great Art was equally domineering. By capturing a person's aura and using it to form a "soul shadow," one could kill them out of thin air just by destroying the shadow, even if they were a thousand miles apart. [[2901 旁白 neutral]]
The Taiwei Imperial Edict Treasure Talisman was even more ridiculous. [[2902 旁白 neutral]]
Once the talisman was formed, it didn't harm the body or kill the soul. Instead, it specifically destroyed merit and fortune. Even a child of destiny, if hit by this divine art, would become an unlucky person. [[2903 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, the most powerful aspect was the combination of the three divine arts. [[2904 旁白 neutral]]
This was also the effect of the great divine art 'True Art of Supreme Yin Form-Shedding and Corpse Liberation' that most tempted Lv Yang: it increased a cultivator's chances of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm! [[2905 旁白 neutral]]
For this reason alone, Lv Yang was determined to obtain this great divine art! [[2906 旁白 neutral]]
The years passed quickly, like a flowing river. [[2907 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, five years had gone by. [[2908 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the Blood-Clothed Tower, Lv Yang leaned against a railing, looking up at the sky. He silently circulated the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art'. With each breath, he breathed in and out clouds and mist, transforming them into many strange and wonderful sights. [[2909 旁白 neutral]]
The eighth transformation, the Mirage Transformation! [[2910 旁白 neutral]]
Although the spiritual energy on Skull Mountain was poor, Lv Yang had a lot of money and had stored up a large amount of spirit stones in advance, so his cultivation did not slow down. [[2911 旁白 neutral]]
And after five years of hard cultivation, although he had made no progress with the Taiwei Imperial Edict Treasure Talisman, he had a sudden inspiration while studying the divine art. His true qi broke through on its own. By the time he realized it, the qi seed in his dantian had transformed again, faintly taking the shape of a dragon. [[2912 旁白 neutral]]
Eighth level of Qi Refining! [[2913 旁白 neutral]]
"Although the improvement from the seventh to the eighth level of Qi Refining is not as dramatic as from the sixth to the seventh, my true qi and magical power have still increased several times over." [[2914 吕阳 happy]]
"In the end, realm is the foundation!" [[2915 吕阳 neutral]]
"So what if I don't have a great divine art? With my current strength, I can even kill a true disciple in the middle stage of Qi Refining, fighting across realms!" [[2916 吕阳 happy]]
"And there is still the ninth transformation..." [[2917 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang's heart burned with excitement. The ninth transformation, the "Flying Fish Transformation," could break through bottlenecks. In other words, after he reached the ninth level of Qi Refining, he could immediately aim for the peak! [[2918 旁白 happy]]
"The path to immortality is in sight! This is worth celebrating!" [[2919 吕阳 happy]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang's mood greatly improved, and the gloom from failing to master the Taiwei Imperial Edict Treasure Talisman was swept away. He then cheerfully walked out of his quiet room. [[2920 旁白 happy]]
But before that, Lv Yang first used a Qi-Condensing Art. [[2921 旁白 neutral]]
In the next second, his newly advanced, powerful aura was completely concealed, returning to the seventh level of Qi Refining, just a little stronger than five years ago. [[2922 旁白 neutral]]
"Attack with three parts, keep seven for yourself... you can never have too many hidden cards." [[2923 吕阳 neutral]]
Not long after, the Chu Sheng Sect disciples under the command of the Blood-Clothed Tower quickly gathered. Seeing Lv Yang, they all bowed deeply without a word. [[2924 旁白 neutral]]
"Congratulations on coming out of seclusion, Tower Master!" [[2925 陌生男1 happy]]
"Rise." Lv Yang waved his hand casually and then asked, "Have there been any troubles near Skull Mountain in the five years I was in seclusion?" [[2926 吕阳 neutral]]
"Reporting to the Tower Master, there have been none." [[2927 陌生男1 neutral]]
An elderly-looking Chu Sheng Sect disciple took the initiative to speak: "Only once, a disciple from the Divine Martial Sect of the Northern Frontier came to provoke us, but was sent away by Fairy Feixia." [[2928 陌生男1 neutral]]
"What about the Profound Female Supreme Yin Treasure Jade? Any news?" [[2929 吕阳 neutral]]
"Not yet..." [[2930 陌生男1 sad]]
After learning about the changes over the past five years, Lv Yang dismissed the crowd, planning to enter seclusion again until the opportunity for Foundation Establishment appeared during the great war between the righteous and demonic sects. [[2931 旁白 neutral]]
However, at that moment, a rainbow-colored streak of light suddenly landed next to the Blood-Clothed Tower. [[2932 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv, please come out and meet me." [[2933 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
Hearing this, Lv Yang scanned with his spiritual sense, then quickly got up to greet her with a smile, "I'm sorry to have Senior Sister come here personally. I should have been the one to visit you." [[2934 吕阳 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, something has happened." [[2935 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia's expression was serious as she said solemnly, "Recently, the Earth-Gazing Instrument detected that the corpse tide, which was supposed to erupt in fifteen years, has arrived early." [[2936 飞霞仙子 fearful]]
"Right now, tens of thousands of zombies are heading towards the market city!" [[2937 飞霞仙子 fearful]]
"Such a change happened without any warning. There must be a mastermind behind it. I suspect it's those brutes from the Divine Martial Sect of the Northern Frontier." [[2938 飞霞仙子 angry]]
"What?" [[2939 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang frowned upon hearing this, and his frown deepened when he noticed Fairy Feixia staring straight at him. "Senior Sister needs my help?" [[2940 吕阳 neutral]]
"That's right. Are you willing to brave the corpse tide with me, Junior Brother?" [[2941 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia smiled, "The corpse tide is a crisis, but also an opportunity. No matter who the mastermind is, they must have relied on a wondrous treasure to trigger it early." [[2942 飞霞仙子 neutral]]
"If we join forces, we might be able to seize it and gain a great opportunity." [[2943 飞霞仙子 happy]]
"Even if something unexpected happens and we get trapped in the corpse tide, with our cultivation levels, the risk is not great!" [[2944 飞霞仙子 happy]]
As she spoke, Fairy Feixia's eyebrows danced, her face radiant and full of high spirits. [[2945 旁白 neutral]]
However, Lv Yang shook his head. [[2946 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry, Senior Sister... I am not as strong as you. My strength is low, and I haven't learned any divine arts, only some formations. It's better for me to stay and guard the place." [[2947 吕阳 neutral]]
No matter how small the risk, it was still a risk. [[2948 旁白 neutral]]
A wise man does not stand under a crumbling wall. All he had to do now was cultivate step-by-step, and he would definitely reach the peak of Qi Refining. Why risk his life? [[2949 旁白 neutral]]
Not worth it! [[2950 旁白 neutral]]
The main goal in this life was to reach the peak of Qi Refining. He could take risks after that, but before then, it was better to be cautious. [[2951 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, you're not going?" Seeing Lv Yang refuse, Fairy Feixia's beautiful eyebrows furrowed slightly. Her usually cold expression showing such distress made her look pitiful. "The path of immortality is short. To achieve something, one must be willing to risk everything... I thought you understood this." [[2952 飞霞仙子 sad]]
Lv Yang's Daoist heart was like iron, completely unmoved. "Times are different now. Please understand, Senior Sister." [[2953 吕阳 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, you've changed." [[2954 飞霞仙子 sad]]
Fairy Feixia shook her head in disappointment, "In that case, you can stay and guard the market city. But you won't get any share of the opportunities." [[2955 飞霞仙子 angry]]
"..." [[2956 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang just smiled and didn't reply. [[2957 旁白 neutral]]
To be honest, he felt that Fairy Feixia wasn't like a typical Chu Sheng Sect disciple... how to put it... she had a certain innocence, as if she had never been truly beaten down by the sect. [[2958 旁白 neutral]]
With the corpse tide here, even if you get a huge opportunity, don't you still have to escape back to the market city I'm guarding? [[2959 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, you say the opportunity is not for me? Then don't blame me for saying you fought bravely and sacrificed yourselves on the front lines against the corpse tide... [[2960 旁白 neutral]]
