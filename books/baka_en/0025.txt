Chapter 25: A Shock from Great Luck [[1979 旁白 neutral]]
The exploding treasure light was like a monstrous wave. It instantly tore apart the formation set up by Fairy Qingchen, then drowned Lv Yang, Liu Xin, and Chen Xin'an. [[1980 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin was the first to scream. To deal with Lv Yang, he had summoned the banner spirit and then Chen Xin'an, which used up most of his true qi. Now he couldn't resist the explosion's impact. His body was instantly set on fire and turned to ash. The Ten Thousand Spirits Banner in his hand fell powerlessly from the air. [[1981 旁白 neutral]]
"As expected of a disciple from our sacred sect." [[1982 陈信安 neutral]]
Once Liu Xin died, Chen Xin'an could no longer exist, even though he had some power left. He could only sigh and then scatter with the wind. [[1983 旁白 neutral]]
As for Lv Yang, he was directly swallowed by the treasure light and vanished. [[1984 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, the raging treasure light slowly calmed down, revealing Xiao Shiye's figure. His face was filled with intense joy. [[1985 旁白 happy]]
"I won!" [[1986 萧石叶 happy]]
Xiao Shiye laughed excitedly. Detonating a spiritual treasure was his ultimate move, but it had many limitations and was easy for others to dodge. [[1987 旁白 neutral]]
To kill an enemy with this move, you first needed to limit the area to ensure it would hit. [[1988 旁白 neutral]]
Second, the explosion's power was not concentrated. It covered a large area but was too scattered. So, the enemy had to be weakened to a certain point to ensure a one-hit kill. [[1989 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, the spiritual treasure had its own consciousness and might not cooperate with the self-detonation. [[1990 旁白 neutral]]
"Fortunately, luck is still on my side!" [[1991 萧石叶 happy]]
Xiao Shiye felt that since joining the Chu Sheng Sect, his luck had completely changed. He got everything he wanted, and whatever he did seemed to have divine help. [[1992 旁白 neutral]]
When trading the Death-Substituting Yin Puppets, he was lucky enough to sell at the highest point, making hundreds of thousands of contribution points. [[1993 旁白 neutral]]
He took a casual trip to the mortal world and easily found a magic treasure left behind by someone from the past. [[1994 旁白 neutral]]
When he was being hunted, he happened to find Lv Yang to use as a shield. [[1995 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what crisis he faced, he always came out of it safely. Through a series of coincidences, he would end up unharmed and with the greatest benefits. [[1996 旁白 neutral]]
"What a fine Ten Thousand Spirits Banner. From now on, it's mine." [[1997 萧石叶 happy]]
Just as Xiao Shiye was about to step forward and take the treasure, a figure surrounded by blood-red light appeared beside him and also reached for the banner. [[1998 旁白 surprised]]
Seeing this, Xiao Shiye froze for a moment, and then his whole body began to tremble. [[1999 旁白 fearful]]
"What, Brother Xiao wants this magic treasure too?" [[2000 吕阳 neutral]]
The blood shadow flickered, then slowly revealed Lv Yang's face. He turned and grinned at Xiao Shiye, which made him tremble in fear. [[2001 旁白 fearful]]
"Are you a man or a ghost?" [[2002 萧石叶 fearful]]
Xiao Shiye's face turned pale. He looked at the Blood-Transforming Divine Light surrounding Lv Yang, and the images of those he had sucked dry flashed through his mind. [[2003 旁白 fearful]]
The next moment, he quickly let go of the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner and bowed respectfully. [[2004 旁白 fearful]]
"Congratulations, Senior Brother. This junior brother was keeping the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner for you. Now it is returned to its rightful owner!" [[2005 萧石叶 fearful]]
"How thoughtful of you." [[2006 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang smilingly took the "Innate One Qi Ten Thousand Spirits Banner." He examined it for a moment, then injected his spiritual power into it and poured out two storage bags. [[2007 旁白 neutral]]
These were the storage bags of Liu Xin and Fairy Qingchen. [[2008 旁白 neutral]]
He opened the storage bags. A copy of the "Innate Dao Scripture" was inside, along with a book called "Secret Manual of Array Treasures," which clearly belonged to Fairy Qingchen. [[2009 旁白 neutral]]
"These are all good things." [[2010 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang sighed with emotion. He memorized the contents of the two Dao books, then looked at Xiao Shiye, who was backing away step by step, trying to create distance between them. [[2011 旁白 neutral]]
To be honest, Xiao Shiye's killing move was truly unexpected. [[2012 旁白 neutral]]
A spiritual treasure self-destructing could kill even someone at the peak of Qi Refining. In theory, it should have been a fatal blow, but Lv Yang was an exception. [[2013 旁白 neutral]]
Because he cultivated the Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light. [[2014 旁白 neutral]]
He was now a blood shadow that only looked human. He had form but no substance. His true spirit was completely tied to the sword core. As long as the sword core was not destroyed, he would not die. [[2015 旁白 neutral]]
Facing Xiao Shiye's self-destructing spiritual treasure, the sword core made of Gold Essence and Jade Marrow was much tougher than a mere physical body. Although it was not completely unharmed, it was not destroyed. So after the explosion passed, Lv Yang reformed and gained the most from the situation. [[2016 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang looked at Xiao Shiye with great fondness. [[2017 旁白 neutral]]
He had not been wrong about him. This Xiao Shiye was a real talent! Without him, how could he have gained so much? [[2018 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you very much for this, Junior Brother Xiao." [[2019 吕阳 happy]]
"To show my gratitude, I will send you on your way." [[2020 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang chuckled, then waved his hand. A ray of blood-red light fell upon Xiao Shiye. Before he could even speak, he was sucked dry. [[2021 旁白 neutral]]
Keeping this person alive was too great a risk. [[2022 旁白 neutral]]
With such great luck, what if he rose to power later and came back for revenge? It was better to end it now and remove the problem completely. [[2023 旁白 neutral]]
"But he died just like that?" Lv Yang looked at Xiao Shiye's body and touched his chin, a little surprised. "With his heaven-defying luck, shouldn't a powerful person have appeared to stop me? I was even prepared for it, but it was so easy." [[2024 吕阳 surprised]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang suddenly had a thought and used his Qi-Observing Technique on Xiao Shiye again. [[2025 旁白 neutral]]
A strange scene appeared. [[2026 旁白 surprised]]
Before, when he looked at Xiao Shiye, he saw a sky-high treasure light, a sign of immense luck. But now, all the treasure light had vanished into thin air. [[2027 旁白 surprised]]
Looking at this, a thought appeared in Lv Yang's mind for no reason: [[2028 旁白 neutral]]
This person's luck has run out. [[2029 旁白 neutral]]
"Sigh." [[2030 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, a sigh suddenly sounded. [[2031 旁白 surprised]]
Lv Yang looked up at the sky, his expression frozen in a moment of shock. All his thoughts were frozen in that instant. [[2032 旁白 fearful]]
A figure had appeared in front of Xiao Shiye's body at some point. [[2033 旁白 surprised]]
The man wore a crane-feather cloak and had a smile on his face. He gently waved a feather fan and looked handsome and charming. At first glance, he looked like a handsome scholar on an outing. [[2034 旁白 neutral]]
But with his appearance, the whole world seemed to lose its color. Only the place where he stood became the center of everything, gathering all the blessings, wealth, and luck of the world. He was the favorite of the heavens, making people feel jealous and hateful. [[2035 旁白 neutral]]
"Is this all you got?" [[2036 鸿运 neutral]]
The newcomer reached out his hand. The "Innate Dao Scripture" and the Innate One Qi Ten Thousand Spirits Banner that Lv Yang had just put away flew out of his storage bag and into his hand. [[2037 旁白 surprised]]
Just then, a voice suddenly came from nowhere: "Hong Yun, you've come out of seclusion?" [[2038 陌生男1 surprised]]
The Daoist called "Hong Yun" looked up, as if meeting someone's gaze, and chuckled, "I had no choice. The person I chose suddenly died." [[2039 鸿运 neutral]]
The voice sounded a little surprised too: "Died? Your person can die? What happened?" [[2040 陌生男1 surprised]]
"It's funny you ask. It was because of bad luck." [[2041 鸿运 neutral]]
"I gave him so much luck so he could fish for that Rainbow Fish in the Merit Pool. But there were too many variables, and his luck was used up ahead of time." [[2042 鸿运 neutral]]
"When his luck ran out, death was of course imminent." [[2043 鸿运 neutral]]
After speaking, the Daoist Hong Yun weighed the "Innate Dao Scripture" in his hand, shook his head, and put it away. Then he looked at Lv Yang. [[2044 旁白 neutral]]
"This person, on the other hand, is a bit interesting." [[2045 鸿运 neutral]]
The Daoist Hong Yun pinched his fingers to calculate, and the smile on his face grew wider. "This person is a huge variable. It seems the recent trouble with the Death-Substituting Yin Puppets is related to him." [[2046 鸿运 neutral]]
"Hmm, his background is clean. But why would a mortal have the cultivation of a fourth-level Qi Refining disciple right after joining? He's hiding it on purpose. It seems he's a rogue cultivator who brought his skills with him, which is fine... wait, that's not right. He learned the Divine Empyrean Sword-Riding True Art before joining? Is he a spy from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion?" [[2047 鸿运 surprised]]
The more the Daoist Hong Yun calculated, the more interested he became. [[2048 旁白 neutral]]
Except for the Hundred Lives Book, all of Lv Yang's secrets were revealed by the Daoist Hong Yun as he deduced the cause and effect, peeling back the layers. Finally, he frowned: [[2049 旁白 neutral]]
"...He cultivated the Heavenly Demon Blood-Transforming Divine Light?" [[2050 鸿运 surprised]]
The next second, the interest in the Daoist Hong Yun's eyes quickly faded, replaced by a look of disgust. [[2051 旁白 angry]]
By turning into a blood shadow, his path to immortality was cut off. Such a cultivator was not worth his energy, and certainly not fit to be the next "Child of Destiny." [[2052 旁白 neutral]]
"What a pity about the Rainbow Fish in the Merit Pool. I didn't get it this time. I'll have to wait for the next." [[2053 鸿运 sad]]
The Daoist Hong Yun looked away. He took a step and disappeared, like a fisherman who had run out of bait and had to leave empty-handed. [[2054 旁白 neutral]]
Only Lv Yang was left standing there. [[2055 旁白 neutral]]
Sweat poured down like rain. [[2056 旁白 fearful]]
