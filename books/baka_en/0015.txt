Chapter 15: Fishing [[1186 旁白 neutral]]
"Who made a deal with you? Maybe in the next life!" [[1187 吕阳 angry]]
"With The Hundred Lives Book, I'll just take the 'Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon Riding Ascension Scroll' in this life, and get the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art' in the next. They will both be mine!" [[1188 吕阳 neutral]]
From the very beginning, Lv Yang had never trusted Zhao Xuhe. [[1189 旁白 neutral]]
Sharing the Dao scripture was just a temporary measure. Lv Yang was certain that as soon as Zhao Xuhe escaped, he would find a way to kill him. [[1190 旁白 neutral]]
However, Zhao Xuhe was stronger, and Lv Yang wasn't confident he could kill him to eliminate the threat for good. If they fought to the death, Lv Yang himself might be the one to die. [[1191 旁白 neutral]]
Furthermore, his loan was about to be due, and he had no way to repay it. There was little time left in this life. So, as soon as he got the Dao scripture, Lv Yang decisively self-destructed. [[1192 旁白 neutral]]
[You brazenly self-destructed and died.] [[1193 旁白 neutral]]
[Current remaining pages in The Hundred Lives Book: 97] [[1194 旁白 neutral]]
[Restarting a new life, you can choose one of the following gains from your previous life:] [[1195 旁白 neutral]]
1. Treasures. [[1196 旁白 neutral]]
2. Cultivation. [[1197 旁白 neutral]]
3. Lifespan. [[1198 旁白 neutral]]
4. Give up all gains and awaken a random talent based on your previous life's experiences.] [[1199 旁白 neutral]]
"Those whose names are called, come before me." [[1200 刘信 neutral]]
His consciousness cleared. Liu Xin's familiar and hateful voice sounded from the stage. Lv Yang ignored it and said in his heart, "I choose cultivation." [[1201 旁白 neutral]]
Boom! [[1202 旁白 neutral]]
In the next second, Lv Yang felt a surge of True Qi erupt from his dantian and quickly flow through his limbs, frantically transforming his essence, energy, and spirit. But he clenched his teeth and activated the Qi-concealing art he had obtained from the three black-robed men, containing all the commotion beneath his skin. [[1203 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, Lv Yang let out a long, deep breath of turbid air. [[1204 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm back again!" [[1205 吕阳 happy]]
Fourth level of Qi Refining, mid-stage! [[1206 旁白 neutral]]
Lifting his head to look at Liu Xin on the stage, Lv Yang no longer felt the fear he had on their first meeting. At this moment, Liu Xin was only at the sixth level of Qi Refining! [[1207 旁白 neutral]]
Only after Liu Xin selected an in-name disciple and refined them into Innate True Qi could he break through his bottleneck to the late stage of Qi Refining. Only then would he have a chance of seeing through Lv Yang's Qi-concealing art. Before that, even if Lv Yang stood right in front of him, he would only see him as an ordinary person. [[1208 旁白 neutral]]
"But there's also a pleasant surprise." [[1209 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang looked inside his dantian and saw a swirling white Qi. It was the Innate True Qi from his previous life. It was still here in this life! [[1210 旁白 surprised]]
"I understand now. The Hundred Lives Book doesn't return to the original anchor point, but to my previous life!" [[1211 吕阳 surprised]]
This was undoubtedly a good thing. [[1212 旁白 neutral]]
It meant that the treasures, cultivation, and even lifespan he chose in each life could be carried over to the next, so he wouldn't have to start from scratch every time. [[1213 旁白 neutral]]
Next, Lv Yang's actions were the same as before. [[1214 旁白 neutral]]
Go on stage, get assigned, Joyful Union Hall. [[1215 旁白 neutral]]
Overcome Yu Suzhen. [[1216 旁白 neutral]]
He lay low, broke through after three months, and became a formal disciple without attracting any attention. [[1217 旁白 neutral]]
"According to my plan for this life, besides the remaining 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art', there are two other major things worth trying." [[1218 旁白 neutral]]
The first was naturally the "Merit Lottery". [[1219 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang stayed in his grotto for a few days, then went to the Merit Hall to accept the "Accumulate Merit" mission. Afterward, he rushed straight to the Merit Pool. [[1220 旁白 neutral]]
"2025113!" [[1221 吕阳 happy]]
Standing in the crowd around the Merit Pool, Lv Yang coolly combed his hair and began to imagine how he would spend the grand prize from the Merit Pool. [[1222 旁白 happy]]
"A billion, a billion, enough to last a lifetime~!" [[1223 吕阳 happy]]
Goodbye, poverty. I will miss you. [[1224 吕阳 happy]]
In the next second, a commotion erupted in the crowd. Countless people looked at Lv Yang in surprise, and at the Merit Fish that had been drawn with the number he chose. [[1225 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother, you've got good luck." [[1226 陌生男1 neutral]]
Someone approached Lv Yang, his tone envious. "A purple Merit Fish. Although it's only a little better than white and blue, it's still a rare sight." [[1227 陌生男1 neutral]]
"...What?" [[1228 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang tilted his head, a question mark appearing above it. [[1229 旁白 neutral]]
A purple Merit Fish? [[1230 旁白 surprised]]
Not a rainbow one? [[1231 旁白 surprised]]
Lv Yang quickly looked at the Merit Fish he had drawn. It was glowing with a purple light. He checked the number he had chosen; it was 2025113, that was correct. [[1232 旁白 neutral]]
Why didn't I win!? [[1233 吕阳 angry]]
Could that lucky person from his past life, Xiao Shiye, have been lying? But he couldn't have known someone could restart their life, so he had no reason to lie. [[1234 旁白 neutral]]
In that case... [[1235 旁白 neutral]]
"This is rigged!" [[1236 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang's hands trembled with anger, his face flushed red. He finally understood: what lucky person? That Xiao Shiye was clearly a plant! [[1237 旁白 angry]]
"Forget it, at least it's a Merit Fish." Lv Yang could only comfort himself this way. Purple was still rare, second only to gold and rainbow. Although he missed the billion-point prize, eating the purple Merit Fish could probably help his cultivation reach the fifth level of Qi Refining quickly. [[1238 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking this, Lv Yang felt much better. [[1239 旁白 neutral]]
Then, just in case, he didn't take the Merit Fish back to his grotto. He ate it on the spot in front of everyone and then began to meditate to refine its energy. [[1240 旁白 neutral]]
After he finished, Lv Yang clearly felt several gazes on him disappear. [[1241 旁白 neutral]]
The result was as he expected. The essence of the purple Merit Fish allowed him to smoothly break through to the fifth level of Qi Refining, and he even touched the threshold of the sixth level. [[1242 旁白 neutral]]
"And this is just purple. If it were rainbow..." [[1243 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang was lost in thought for a moment. After all, when Xiao Shiye ate the rainbow Merit Fish in his past life, he went from the first level of Qi Refining straight to the peak overnight. [[1244 旁白 neutral]]
"Forget it, I can't force it." [[1245 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang quickly calmed down. The first matter was a failure, but there was still a chance for the second: the "Death Substitute Yin Puppet Price Bubble Incident". [[1246 旁白 neutral]]
The old man in the Library Pavilion, Wang Bairong, had nearly lost his fortune because of it, and was then tricked by Zhao Xuhe into becoming cannon fodder for Dragon Coil Island. But in the end, it was because Wang Bairong had entered the market too late. He was different; he knew exactly when this price bubble would change. [[1247 旁白 neutral]]
"The price is actually already starting to rise." [[1248 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang opened his disciple token and checked the price of the Death Substitute Yin Puppet. He saw that it had indeed fluctuated slightly. It was clear that insiders were manipulating it. [[1249 旁白 neutral]]
"To enter the market, I still need a large enough amount of capital..." [[1250 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang thought for a moment and turned to go to the Merit Hall. [[1251 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, in the eyes of the older disciples, a new disciple like him was a lamb ready for slaughter. Before long, Zhao Xuhe approached him. [[1252 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, you don't look so good. Are you having some kind of trouble?" [[1253 赵旭河 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked up and gave a bitter smile. "What trouble could it be? Just a lack of money. Do you know of any missions to earn Contribution Points, Senior Brother?" [[1254 吕阳 sad]]
"So it's about money... I understand. I've been there. When I was your age, I was also worried about Contribution Points, stressed every day. My cultivation partner even left me...唉, endless missions, it felt like there was no hope." [[1255 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe sighed, acting as if he and Lv Yang were in the same boat. [[1256 旁白 neutral]]
After speaking, he patted Lv Yang's shoulder and said, "Senior Brother, I've wasted half my life to finally learn a universal truth." [[1257 赵旭河 neutral]]
"And that is, money is static." [[1258 赵旭河 neutral]]
"So you have to make money make money, use Contribution Points to earn more Contribution Points. Only then can you escape being a slave to the sect and escape this fate of being livestock!" [[1259 赵旭河 neutral]]
Lv Yang's face showed admiration. "Listening to you, Senior Brother, is better than ten years of studying!" [[1260 吕阳 happy]]
But soon, Lv Yang lowered his head in disappointment. "But Senior Brother, I don't even have any Contribution Points now. How can I earn more?" [[1261 吕阳 sad]]
"Too small! Your thinking is too small!" [[1262 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe's expression became even friendlier as he smiled, showing his teeth. "You may not have money now, but you can borrow it. Just pay it back after you've earned more, right?" [[1263 赵旭河 neutral]]
"But..." Lv Yang still looked hesitant. [[1264 吕阳 neutral]]
Seeing a new business opportunity, Zhao Xuhe was not about to let it go. He quickly said, "How about this? I feel a connection with you, Junior Brother. I'll lend you some!" [[1265 赵旭河 happy]]
Lv Yang's eyes lit up. "Really?" [[1266 吕阳 happy]]
Seeing his eager expression, Zhao Xuhe was certain the fish was hooked! [[1267 旁白 neutral]]
"Of course it's true!" [[1268 赵旭河 happy]]
Zhao Xuhe patted his chest to guarantee it, while also mentioning the reputation of his Three Rivers Association. Then he asked Lv Yang, "How much are you planning to borrow, Junior Brother?" [[1269 赵旭河 neutral]]
Lv Yang was silent for a moment, then held up two fingers. [[1270 旁白 neutral]]
"Two hundred?" [[1271 赵旭河 surprised]]
"Two thousand!" [[1272 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang had a determined look on his face. "To be honest, I haven't used my technique loan yet, which is worth 1000 Contribution Points. I also have my newcomer benefits: the White Bone Flying Sword, the Qi and Blood Pills, the Human-Faced Owl... I'll use these as collateral. Senior Brother Zhao, can you lend me 2000 Contribution Points?" [[1273 吕阳 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe was stunned. [[1274 旁白 neutral]]
Are young people these days all so reckless? [[1275 旁白 surprised]]
I've only just said a few words, and you're already going all in? [[1276 旁白 surprised]]
Before Zhao Xuhe could react, Lv Yang said something even more shocking. "Senior Brother Zhao, I plan to buy Death Substitute Yin Puppets with everything I have." [[1277 吕阳 neutral]]
"What!?" [[1278 赵旭河 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe was shocked at first, but then, as if he had thought of something, he quickly lowered his voice. "Junior Brother... don't tell me you have some inside information?" [[1279 赵旭河 surprised]]
"Senior Brother is wise." Lv Yang also lowered his voice. "I was choosing a technique in the Library Pavilion earlier and overheard Senior Brother Wang Bairong at the door. It seems the war in the south is not going well, and the Myriad-Corpse Pit that produces the Death Substitute Yin Puppets has fallen. The sect is just keeping the news secret..." [[1280 吕阳 neutral]]
"Hiss!" [[1281 赵旭河 surprised]]
Hearing this, Zhao Xuhe gasped. His eyes filled with intense greed, as he clearly smelled a business opportunity. [[1282 旁白 neutral]]
If this news was true, then a chance to get rich had arrived! [[1283 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the excited Zhao Xuhe, Lv Yang sneered inwardly. [[1284 旁白 neutral]]
The fish is hooked! [[1285 旁白 happy]]
Is anyone even reading this? It feels like I'm playing a single-player game. [[1286 旁白 neutral]]
