Chapter 7: Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art [[554 旁白 neutral]]
A few days later. [[555 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the cave residence, Lv Yang sat on a cushion, forming a hand seal with his right hand. A speck of spiritual light gathered at his fingertip, finally transforming into a white bone flying sword as thin as a cicada's wing. [[556 旁白 neutral]]
The sword was pale-white and hummed with the sound of thunder when it moved. [[557 旁白 neutral]]
"Go!" [[558 吕阳 neutral]]
With a flick of his finger, Lv Yang sent the white bone sword flying out. It transformed into a magnificent streak of light several meters long, its whistling sound like thunder rolling through the sky. [[559 旁白 neutral]]
"What a great sword art!" [[560 吕阳 happy]]
Seeing this, a look of joy appeared on Lv Yang's face. He then changed the hand seal, and the white bone sword immediately split into two in mid-air. [[561 旁白 happy]]
In the next second, Lv Yang's figure vanished from his spot, as if teleporting, and reappeared where one of the sword lights was. As he changed the sword seal in his hand, his body moved like a bolt of lightning, darting freely between the two sword lights. [[562 旁白 neutral]]
After a long while, Lv Yang stopped, his face filled with excitement. [[563 旁白 happy]]
"Excellent! What an amazing Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art!" [[564 吕阳 happy]]
This sword art was actually very simple. After mastering it, a cultivator could create multiple sword lights and then instantly move to any of them. [[565 旁白 neutral]]
The higher the magic power, the farther the distance of movement. [[566 旁白 neutral]]
If the head of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion were to use it, he could sit in the pavilion and teleport thousands of miles with a single sword strike, taking an enemy's head while chatting and laughing. [[567 旁白 neutral]]
And this was just the basic use of the sword art. [[568 旁白 neutral]]
It was said that at higher levels, the sword light could manifest the might of divine thunder, but that part of the technique was beyond Lv Yang's reach. [[569 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't that he couldn't obtain it through cultivation plundering, but that Yun Miaoqing didn't know it herself. [[570 旁白 neutral]]
But that was normal. After all, a complete "Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art" could not be bought for a mere 1,000 contribution points; 10,000 would be more like it. [[571 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmph, how stupid!" [[572 云妙清 angry]]
A cold sneer came from behind him. Lv Yang turned to see the woman from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion looking at him with disgust, disdain, and contempt. [[573 旁白 neutral]]
After spending many days together, Lv Yang had gotten to know her quite well. [[574 旁白 neutral]]
The woman's name was Yun Miaoqing, an inner disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion. She studied under Master Shenxiao and specialized in the Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art. She once had a cultivation level of the sixth layer of Qi Refining. [[575 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked at Yun Miaoqing and asked curiously, "Did I use the sword art incorrectly?" [[576 吕阳 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing turned her head away. "Do you think I would tell you? Demon, even if you stole my sword art, you're just copying it poorly!" [[577 云妙清 angry]]
"Why must you be like this?" [[578 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang shook his head, walked up to Yun Miaoqing, and said helplessly, "Are you sure you won't tell me? Or are you going to force me to use *that* again?" [[579 吕阳 neutral]]
"*That...*" [[580 云妙清 fearful]]
A blush appeared on Yun Miaoqing's delicate face, and her beautiful eyes became hazy for a moment. She quickly came to her senses and stared at Lv Yang with deep hatred. [[581 旁白 angry]]
"It's just that demonic technique. Do you think I would yield?" [[582 云妙清 angry]]
"Even though you say that... you've already yielded once." Lv Yang pointed to the emblem on Yun Miaoqing's chest and said, "You haven't forgotten, have you?" [[583 吕阳 neutral]]
"You're lying!" [[584 云妙清 angry]]
Looking at the mark on her body, Yun Miaoqing bit her lip in humiliation. "That was only because you took advantage of me when I was weak!" [[585 云妙清 angry]]
After speaking, she gripped the pendant around her neck. [[586 旁白 neutral]]
It was a delicately crafted small sword of white jade, a magic sword that only disciples of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion could possess. It served the same purpose as Lv Yang's disciple token. [[587 旁白 neutral]]
"I am a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, and I will never stand with the demonic path. That will never change!" [[588 云妙清 angry]]
"No matter how powerful your demonic art is, a person's heart cannot be swayed by such evil ways." [[589 云妙清 angry]]
"My loyalty to the Pavilion will never waver." [[590 云妙清 angry]]
"I swear it on my magic sword!" [[591 云妙清 angry]]
As her voice fell, Yun Miaoqing clenched her teeth and looked at Lv Yang with determination, like a pure lotus flower trapped in mud but remaining unstained. [[592 旁白 neutral]]
Another day later. [[593 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the cave residence, Lv Yang sat on the cushion, with his five centers facing heaven. [[594 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, Lv Yang let out a heavy breath. At the same time, Yun Miaoqing lifted her swan-like white neck and let out a long sigh. [[595 旁白 neutral]]
"You've actually mastered the Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art quite well. There are no major issues. If there are any, they are with external things..." [[596 云妙清 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing's face was red as she spoke weakly. [[597 旁白 neutral]]
Under Lv Yang's harsh interrogation, she finally gave in. When Lv Yang asked her again, she just snorted coldly and obediently explained: [[598 旁白 neutral]]
"As soon as we disciples of the Sword Pavilion enter the Qi Refining realm, we use a secret method of the sect to forge a Sword Core from precious metals and various external medicines. All the sword techniques in the Pavilion require the aid of a Sword Core to unleash their full power. The higher the quality of the Sword Core, the greater the power of the sword technique." [[599 云妙清 neutral]]
After Yun Miaoqing's explanation, Lv Yang finally understood. [[600 旁白 neutral]]
Currently, when he practiced the Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art, he could only create two sword lights, and their effect was limited to teleportation. His speed had increased, but his attack power was lacking. [[601 旁白 neutral]]
However, with the help of a Sword Core, the number of sword lights Lv Yang could create would at least double. [[602 旁白 neutral]]
He could also merge his body with the Sword Core, allowing him to unleash astonishing slashes while moving within the sword light. This would give him a great advantage in fights. [[603 旁白 neutral]]
In a direct confrontation, Lv Yang would only need to control the Sword Core and create sword lights around him. An opponent surrounded by the sword lights would be trapped. [[604 旁白 neutral]]
After that, no matter what methods the opponent used, he could easily dodge them and attack from another direction, leaving them struggling to defend. After a few rounds of this, the opponent would naturally reveal a fatal weakness. Then, with a final, powerful strike, their fate would be sealed. [[605 旁白 neutral]]
"That's why the disciples of my Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion are the best fighters in Jiangnan!" [[606 云妙清 happy]]
Speaking of this, a proud expression appeared on Yun Miaoqing's face. [[607 旁白 happy]]
However, in the next second, as Lv Yang moved forcefully, the pride on her face vanished, replaced by a blush, and she couldn't help but let out a soft moan. [[608 旁白 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing's eyes were tightly shut. She waited for a moment, but when she realized Lv Yang had stopped moving, she shifted restlessly and opened her eyes. [[609 旁白 neutral]]
"Demon, you..." [[610 云妙清 surprised]]
Lv Yang stood up and got dressed. "So the difference was the Sword Core. I also know the forging method now... Well, I'm done with you. You can go rest." [[611 吕阳 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing: "???" [[612 云妙清 surprised]]
Suddenly separated, the only emotion left on Yun Miaoqing's face was confusion. [[613 旁白 neutral]]
Is he kidding? It's over already? [[614 云妙清 surprised]]
What about the plundering? [[615 云妙清 surprised]]
The next second, she snapped back to her senses and subconsciously gripped the magic sword around her neck. "No, this is good... I am a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion..." [[616 云妙清 neutral]]
"I need to make some money." [[617 吕阳 neutral]]
Walking out of the cave residence, Lv Yang began to think about the future. [[618 旁白 neutral]]
"I only have 50 contribution points left. After deducting 30 points for this month's rent for the cave, if I don't earn more, I'll have to move back to the Joyful Union Hall next month." [[619 旁白 sad]]
In the Chu Sheng Sect, there were many ways to earn contribution points. [[620 旁白 neutral]]
These included, but were not limited to, salaries from holding positions within the sect, selling personal items, rewards from bounties, and sect missions. [[621 旁白 neutral]]
"But for a disciple like me with no backing, no wealth, and no power, I have no connections for sect positions, most of my personal items are worthless, and I'm not strong enough to complete high-reward bounties. My only option is to take on sect missions and work for the sect just to get by..." [[622 旁白 sad]]
The more Lv Yang thought about it, the angrier he became. [[623 旁白 angry]]
I'm already a cultivator, and I still have to work? [[624 吕阳 angry]]
