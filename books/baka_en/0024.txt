Chapter 24: Self-Destruction! [[1891 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin was once just an ordinary disciple in the Chu Sheng Sect. He lived a grueling life of completing missions, cultivating, and paying off debts. [[1892 旁白 neutral]]
Until a fortunate encounter completely changed his destiny. [[1893 旁白 neutral]]
It began with a bounty mission from a True Inheritor, who wanted to explore an ancient cave dwelling and needed some cannon fodder to scout the way. [[1894 旁白 neutral]]
Unaware of the circumstances, Liu Xin was lured by the mission's reward and joined the exploration team. By the time he realized he was just cannon fodder, it was too late. He was forced into the cave by the True Inheritor, where he discovered that all the restrictive spells inside were surprisingly ineffective against him. [[1895 旁白 neutral]]
He proceeded without any obstacles and obtained the great opportunity. [[1896 旁白 neutral]]
It was a golden casket containing the "Innate Dao Scripture" and the Innate-Qi Myriad-Spirit Banner. Beside it was a note left by the cave's master. [[1897 旁白 neutral]]
In the note, the cave master called himself the "Innate Wanderer." [[1898 旁白 neutral]]
The scripture and treasure in the casket were meant for a fated person. He had calculated that this person would be a True Inheritor of the Saint Sect, with the character "Xin" in their name. [[1899 旁白 neutral]]
However, he was not resigned to this. [[1900 旁白 neutral]]
In the note, the Innate Wanderer cursed the Chu Sheng Sect for its shamelessness. He wrote that they had forcibly tied his legacy to their True Inheritor, claiming it was destiny when it was not. [[1901 旁白 neutral]]
So, he deliberately tangled the threads of fate and gave the inheritance to Liu Xin instead. [[1902 旁白 neutral]]
The note also warned that Liu Xin would face a life-or-death crisis after getting the treasure, so the master had left him a way to overcome it in the cave. [[1903 旁白 neutral]]
In the original destiny, the false "Xin" was not the true "Xin," so Liu Xin was fated to be cannon fodder, a mere delivery boy for the treasure. But thanks to the Innate Wanderer's careful plan, Liu Xin got the opportunity, turned the tables, and killed the True Inheritor. [[1904 旁白 neutral]]
It was a heart-pounding night. [[1905 旁白 neutral]]
By sunrise, only Liu Xin walked out of the Innate Wanderer's cave, completely transformed. The True Inheritor of the Saint Sect had vanished. [[1906 旁白 neutral]]
However, Liu Xin had not completely killed him. [[1907 旁白 neutral]]
With the help left behind by the Innate Wanderer, he had refined the living True Inheritor, turning him into the strongest Banner Spirit in his possession. [[1908 旁白 neutral]]
As the banner waved, a figure in a black robe emerged. It did not look at Lv Yang at first, but instead gazed around with a nostalgic expression. [[1909 旁白 neutral]]
"The strong eat the weak, and disciples kill each other... The Saint Sect is still the same as I remember." [[1910 陈信安 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, I trust you've been well?" Liu Xin said with a slight bow. [[1911 刘信 neutral]]
"You useless fool. Have you run into a strong enemy you can't handle again?" the black-robed figure sneered with contempt. "The Innate Dao Scripture was truly wasted on you." [[1912 陈信安 angry]]
"I can't compare to you, Senior Brother." [[1913 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin did not get angry and remained respectful. "This person is a sword cultivator and has also mastered the Heavenly Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light. I am indeed no match for him." [[1914 刘信 neutral]]
"Heavenly Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light?" The black-robed figure was surprised to hear this, and his expression turned more serious. Then he shook his head. "To master such a divine ability, he must be quite a character. It's a pity his efforts were in the wrong direction, a complete waste of time. According to our agreement, this is the third time I will act." [[1915 陈信安 neutral]]
"You have a clear view of things, Senior Brother." [[1916 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin nodded. "After this, I will release you to be reincarnated. With your merits and foundation, I believe you will be able to walk the path of the Dao again in your next life." [[1917 刘信 neutral]]
"Good." [[1918 陈信安 neutral]]
The black-robed figure finally turned to look at Lv Yang. [[1919 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Lv Yang and Xiao Shiye had little reaction, but Fairy Qingchen's eyes widened as she stared intently at the black-robed figure. [[1920 旁白 neutral]]
She was no longer a new disciple. [[1921 旁白 neutral]]
At first, she only found the figure vaguely familiar. But when he unleashed his aura, she was suddenly shocked and recognized him. [[1922 旁白 surprised]]
"It's Chen Xinan... Senior Brother Chen!?" [[1923 清尘仙子 surprised]]
The son of the Peak Master of Sky Mending Peak, one of the Four Inner Peaks! The missing True Inheritor! [[1924 旁白 surprised]]
When Chen Xinan went missing back then, the Peak Master of Sky Mending Peak was furious. He personally tried to divine the karmic threads but found nothing, causing a great disturbance. [[1925 旁白 neutral]]
To think he was in Senior Brother Liu's hands? [[1926 清尘仙子 surprised]]
For a moment, Fairy Qingchen's expression changed as if she had realized something. She then subconsciously took a few steps back to create distance from Liu Xin. [[1927 旁白 fearful]]
Puchi! [[1928 旁白 neutral]]
A hand pierced through her. Fairy Qingchen's pretty face was blank, her eyes staring vacantly at the hand buried in her stomach. Then her head tilted to one side, and she breathed her last. [[1929 旁白 neutral]]
She was dead again. [[1930 旁白 neutral]]
"A pity. Since you saw, I cannot let you live." [[1931 刘信 angry]]
With Fairy Qingchen's death, the surrounding formation immediately shook. However, as Liu Xin activated the Myriad-Spirit Banner, her body was instantly absorbed into it. [[1932 旁白 neutral]]
In a few moments, a perfectly intact Fairy Qingchen walked out of the banner, having become a Banner Spirit. [[1933 旁白 neutral]]
Although becoming a Banner Spirit came with many more limitations than when she was alive, she could still maintain the formation. She quickly stabilized the shaking array. [[1934 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the black-robed True Inheritor, Chen Xinan, arrived in front of Lv Yang. [[1935 旁白 neutral]]
"Hm?" [[1936 吕阳 surprised]]
Looking at Chen Xinan, Lv Yang's gaze sharpened. The man's cultivation level was not high, only at the seventh layer of Qi Refining, the same as him. But the feeling he gave off was different. [[1937 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Xinan glanced at Lv Yang and shook his head. "The Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra is a dual cultivation technique that relies on coupling with three thousand women. But your true qi is impure and chaotic; it's obvious it wasn't gained through dual cultivation. The originally fifth-grade Yin-Yang Dragon-Tiger Qi is at most sixth-grade in your hands." [[1938 陈信安 neutral]]
This assessment sent alarm bells ringing in Lv Yang's mind. [[1939 旁白 fearful]]
"May I ask who you are?" [[1940 吕阳 neutral]]
"My name is Chen Xinan. My hand is forced in this matter. But if you can escape and bring news of me back to Sky Mending Peak, my father will surely reward you greatly." [[1941 陈信安 neutral]]
Before his words had faded, Chen Xinan attacked! [[1942 旁白 neutral]]
He pushed his hand forward, and his aura instantly merged with the heavens and the earth. A powerful surge of true qi roared out, stirring the surrounding world's spiritual energy to respond! [[1943 旁白 surprised]]
In that instant, Lv Yang's pupils shrank. [[1944 旁白 fearful]]
It was not because of the power Chen Xinan displayed, but because as Chen Xinan made his move, he could clearly feel the flaws and incompleteness of his own true qi. [[1945 旁白 fearful]]
In a flash, Lv Yang understood. [[1946 旁白 neutral]]
"My Dragon-Tiger Union Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra is not the ultimate version. Sky Mending Peak has a superior technique! This person must be a True Inheritor from Sky Mending Peak!" [[1947 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang's guess was correct. [[1948 旁白 neutral]]
As the son of the Sky Mending Peak Master, Chen Xinan cultivated a technique called the "Sky Mending True Scripture," which was an upgraded version of the Dragon-Tiger Union Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra. [[1949 旁白 neutral]]
Ordinary dual cultivation is done with people, focusing on the union of yin and yang. [[1950 旁白 neutral]]
However, the dual cultivation of the "Sky Mending True Scripture" was with the heavens and the earth, a union with the cosmos itself. The Sky Mending True Qi refined this way was ranked third-grade. [[1951 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, when Chen Xinan struck with his palm, even without using any special abilities, the sheer power of his third-grade true qi was enough to make it difficult for Lv Yang to defend. [[1952 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Liu Xin revealed a confident smile. [[1953 刘信 happy]]
After all, no one knew Chen Xinan's strength better than him. In his eyes, even if Lv Yang were ten times stronger, he would be no match for Chen Xinan. [[1954 旁白 neutral]]
"He will win!" [[1955 刘信 happy]]
Liu Xin made his judgment with certainty, failing to notice that Xiao Shiye, in the distance, was now watching him with a dark expression, seemingly deep in thought. [[1956 旁白 neutral]]
With Xiao Shiye's intelligence, he could naturally see that the situation was not in his favor. [[1957 旁白 fearful]]
"I didn't want to use this... you forced me." [[1958 萧石叶 fearful]]
Xiao Shiye knew very well that he was the weakest. He relied entirely on his collection of magic treasures to hold his ground, but now it seemed that even those were not enough. [[1959 旁白 neutral]]
With this thought, Xiao Shiye took a deep breath and opened his storage pouch. Instantly, a massive aura of spiritual energy and treasured light burst forth from the opening, drawing Liu Xin's attention. Even Chen Xinan and Lv Yang, who were in the middle of a fierce battle, paused and looked over. [[1960 旁白 surprised]]
Then, a small pagoda flew out of Xiao Shiye's storage pouch. [[1961 旁白 neutral]]
The small pagoda seemed to be cast from gold and had nine levels. At its top, a spiritual light manifested in a human-like shape, with lively and intelligent features. [[1962 旁白 neutral]]
"That's... a Spirit Treasure!?" [[1963 刘信 surprised]]
The moment they saw this, before the less-experienced Lv Yang could speak, both Liu Xin and Chen Xinan cried out in shock, their faces filled with horror. [[1964 旁白 surprised]]
When a cultivator refines an item and it produces a treasured light, it is a Magic Treasure. When a treasure gives birth to spiritual intelligence, only then is it a Spirit Treasure! [[1965 旁白 neutral]]
Magic Treasures are divided into lower, middle, and upper grades and have wondrous uses. However, no matter how powerful a Magic Treasure is, it needs a master to wield it to unleash its power. [[1966 旁白 neutral]]
But a Spirit Treasure is different. [[1967 旁白 neutral]]
A Spirit Treasure has its own consciousness and can unleash its power even without a master. More importantly, a Spirit Treasure can cultivate on its own and continuously grow stronger! [[1968 旁白 neutral]]
In the next second, Xiao Shiye formed a hand seal, and the Spirit Treasure pagoda instantly began to expand. [[1969 旁白 fearful]]
"Bastard!" [[1970 陈信安 angry]]
Chen Xinan was the first to curse, his earlier composure completely gone. He could see that Xiao Shiye intended to make the Spirit Treasure self-destruct! [[1971 旁白 fearful]]
On the other side, Liu Xin nearly coughed up blood. [[1972 旁白 fearful]]
This kind of treasure, a masterpiece of creation, was something that typically only Foundation Establishment cultivators could possess. You, Xiao Shiye, not only have one but you're using it to self-destruct? [[1973 旁白 angry]]
What a complete waste of a heavenly treasure! [[1974 刘信 angry]]
What was even more absurd was that the Spirit Treasure pagoda showed no signs of resistance. Instead, it actively cooperated, moving so quickly that he had no time to stop it. [[1975 旁白 fearful]]
"BOOM!" [[1976 旁白 neutral]]
In the next moment, an explosive flash of fire consumed everything. [[1977 旁白 neutral]]
