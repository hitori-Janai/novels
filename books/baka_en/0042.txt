Chapter 42: Profound Yin Form-Seizing, Nail-Head Life-Taking [[3275 旁白 neutral]]
Rumble! [[3276 旁白 neutral]]
A loud cry of pain and increasingly strong waves of spiritual energy came from the sky. Ouyang Haoze's eyes were blood-red; he was clearly furious. [[3277 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, the other two late-stage Qi Refining cultivators from the Divine Martial Sect, Wu Zhichong and Duanmu Yuan, could no longer stand by. [[3278 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Ouyang!" [[3279 吴志冲 fearful]]
Wu Zhichong stepped forward first. He looked at Ouyang Haoze's terrible state and said quietly, full of fear, "The Taixiao Mirror is extremely important..." [[3280 吴志冲 fearful]]
"I understand." [[3281 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Ouyang Haoze glanced back at Wu Zhichong, the anger in his red eyes calming down. He said calmly, "But the demon in this formation is more important! He is young, yet he is an expert in formations and his cultivation is strong. If he reaches the peak of Qi Refining, he could even try for Foundation Establishment." [[3282 欧阳昊泽 neutral]]
"If I can kill a potential Foundation Establishment expert from a demonic sect, then sacrificing a Taixiao Mirror is worth it!" [[3283 欧阳昊泽 neutral]]
Buzz! Buzz! [[3284 旁白 neutral]]
In the sky, the Taixiao Mirror trembled strongly, as if it had a different opinion. [[3285 旁白 neutral]]
But Ouyang Haoze ignored it. It was just a spiritual treasure. When it's useful, I'll call it 'Lord Taixiao.' When it's not, what is it worth? [[3286 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that Ouyang Haoze had made up his mind, Wu Zhichong could only sigh and stop trying to change it. After all, Ouyang Haoze, at the perfection stage of Qi Refining, was their leader from the Divine Martial Sect. Since he had made the decision, he would be responsible for the result. It was enough that Wu Zhichong had tried to warn him. [[3287 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, inside the market. [[3288 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang put away the heavily damaged Blood Sun Sword Pellet. Holding the Innate Qi Myriad Spirits Banner, he watched Ouyang Haoze outside the market with a strange expression. [[3289 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv, you're not dead?" [[3290 飞霞仙子 surprised]]
Fairy Feixia and Lu Yuanchun approached him. One of them looked very happy and surprised, while the other was not only relieved to be alive but also felt wary of Lv Yang. [[3291 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Lv, you really are full of secrets!" [[3292 陆元淳 surprised]]
Lu Yuanchun praised him loudly, "We have defeated Ouyang Haoze! The market is safe now. We can wait until the Sect hears the news and sends help!" [[3293 陆元淳 happy]]
"Defeated? It's too early for that." [[3294 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang shook his head. [[3295 旁白 neutral]]
"That's right! Look at Ouyang Haoze. He's badly hurt. This is more than a simple defeat. It's a serious injury that will teach him a lesson!" [[3296 飞霞仙子 happy]]
Fairy Feixia clapped her hands and smiled. [[3297 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing this, Lu Yuanchun quickly agreed. [[3298 旁白 neutral]]
However, Lv Yang gave a cold smile and said something shocking, "Just pushing him back isn't enough to solve the problem for good. I don't like leaving loose ends." [[3299 吕阳 neutral]]
"It's better to just kill him. Simple and clean." [[3300 吕阳 neutral]]
"Kill... kill who?" [[3301 飞霞仙子 fearful]]
Ouyang Haoze? [[3302 旁白 surprised]]
For a moment, Fairy Feixia and Lu Yuanchun stood frozen in shock. They had never imagined something like this, not even in their wildest dreams. [[3303 旁白 surprised]]
He was a peak Qi Refining expert, a true disciple of a righteous sect! [[3304 旁白 neutral]]
Who could kill him? [[3305 旁白 neutral]]
How could he be killed? [[3306 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, Lv Yang took out the 'Profound Yin Precious Jade' that Lu Yuanchun had returned to him. He made a hand sign and began to channel his energy into the jade in his palm. [[3307 旁白 neutral]]
Then, the jade slowly melted under Lv Yang's control. It turned into a round light, like a clear, pale white mirror. In the light, Lv Yang could see figures appearing in his vision. Each figure was connected to the leftover energy of a person. [[3308 旁白 neutral]]
Judging from the others' reactions, it seemed only he could see them. [[3309 旁白 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia, Lu Yuanchun, Ouyang Haoze, Wu Zhichong, Duanmu Yuan... The energy of everyone who had fought here remained. [[3310 旁白 neutral]]
"So this is the Profound Yin Form-Seizing Art..." [[3311 吕阳 neutral]]
This was the second special power from the 'Grand Yin Form-Shedding and Corpse-Deliverance True Art'. The only hard part was needing a special item. So, after getting the jade, Lv Yang learned it almost instantly! [[3312 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's test its power." [[3313 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked down and quickly focused on a trace of energy. It was Ouyang Haoze's. He used the Profound Yin Form-Seizing Art to grab it. [[3314 旁白 neutral]]
"Profound Yin Form-Seizing..." [[3315 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang activated the power. The round light from the Profound Yin Precious Jade swallowed Ouyang Haoze's energy and then showed his image. [[3316 旁白 neutral]]
"...Nail-Head Life-Taking!" [[3317 吕阳 neutral]]
Then, Lv Yang chopped down with his fingers. [[3318 旁白 neutral]]
With a "crack," the round light split in two, and Ouyang Haoze's image was also split in half from head to toe. [[3319 旁白 neutral]]
To be safe, Lv Yang had cut him vertically. [[3320 旁白 neutral]]
At almost the same time. [[3321 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the market, Ouyang Haoze had just finished talking to Wu Zhichong. He turned to look at the market and threw the Taixiao Mirror into the formation. [[3322 旁白 neutral]]
Although the Taixiao Mirror struggled hard, he had made up his mind to make it explode. [[3323 旁白 neutral]]
But in the next second, Ouyang Haoze's movement stopped suddenly. [[3324 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a strange cut appeared on the top of his head out of nowhere. It quickly spread downwards, ending in a spray of blood. [[3325 旁白 neutral]]
He split apart. [[3326 旁白 neutral]]
His body fell from the sky. The remaining half of his face still showed a look of shock, and his eyes moved slightly, as if he hadn't realized what had just happened. [[3327 旁白 neutral]]
"What happened... Am I... dead?" [[3328 欧阳昊泽 fearful]]
His thoughts disappeared into confusion. [[3329 旁白 neutral]]
Without Ouyang Haoze to control it, the Taixiao Mirror that had fallen into the formation became calm. Lv Yang reached out his hand, and it flew over to him. [[3330 旁白 neutral]]
In the Northern Frontier, at the main headquarters of the Divine Martial Sect. [[3331 旁白 neutral]]
Inside a brightly lit hall. [[3332 旁白 neutral]]
This place was called the 'Soul Lamp Hall.' As the name suggests, it held the soul lamps of many high-ranking members of the Divine Martial Sect, including the Sect Master, elders, and true disciples. [[3333 旁白 neutral]]
As an old power in the Northern Frontier, the Divine Martial Sect had ruled for over a thousand years. Its reputation was strong, and high-ranking members rarely died. Because of this, the disciples on duty here were mostly lazy. They saw the job as an easy way to get sect benefits. [[3334 旁白 neutral]]
Today was like any other day. The disciple on duty was checking the soul lamps as usual. [[3335 旁白 neutral]]
He entered the hall and glanced around. [[3336 旁白 neutral]]
Lit, lit, lit, lit, out, lit, lit... [[3337 旁白 neutral]]
Huh? [[3338 旁白 neutral]]
The disciple blinked his eyes and turned his head to look again. He rubbed his eyes, and his expression slowly changed from casual to horrified. [[3339 旁白 neutral]]
"It's out! It's out! Senior Brother Ouyang's soul lamp is out!?" [[3340 陌生男1 fearful]]
His voice spread instantly. [[3341 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, a middle-aged Daoist appeared in the hall out of thin air. His eyes fell on the extinguished soul lamp, his face filled with shock and anger. [[3342 旁白 neutral]]
How many years had it been? How many years since a true disciple of the Divine Martial Sect had died? [[3343 旁白 neutral]]
"Ouyang... Skull Mountain!?" [[3344 中年道士 angry]]
The middle-aged Daoist's face was dark. He suddenly reached out, took Ouyang Haoze's soul lamp, and forced his power into it, relighting the flame! [[3345 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, the dead cannot be brought back to life. [[3346 旁白 neutral]]
This relit flame could not save Ouyang Haoze's life. At most, it could show the last thing he saw before he died. [[3347 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the flame showed a scene. [[3348 旁白 neutral]]
The middle-aged Daoist immediately recognized it as the Chu Sheng Sect's market at Skull Mountain. Inside the market, a handsome young man was looking up at the sky. [[3349 旁白 neutral]]
It was him? He killed Ouyang Haoze? [[3350 旁白 neutral]]
A deep hatred appeared in the middle-aged Daoist's eyes. [[3351 旁白 neutral]]
Because Ouyang Haoze was not just a true disciple of the sect, but also the most talented young person of his Ouyang family. He was the junior that he had high hopes for! [[3352 旁白 neutral]]
This hatred would not end until death! [[3353 旁白 angry]]
"Hmm?" [[3354 吕阳 neutral]]
In the Skull Mountain market, Lv Yang, who had just collected the Taixiao Mirror, suddenly frowned. He looked up at the sky and felt a chill. [[3355 旁白 neutral]]
He knew this feeling well. [[3356 旁白 neutral]]
It was the feeling of his own fate being manipulated by an outside force. He had felt something similar in his past life when the Sky Mending Peak Master had calculated his destiny. [[3357 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be that another Foundation Establishment expert was plotting against him!? [[3358 旁白 fearful]]
