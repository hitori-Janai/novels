Chapter 2: Following Heaven is Easy, Defying it is Hard [[108 旁白 neutral]]
To go ahead or not, that was a troubling question. [[109 旁白 neutral]]
However, Lü Yang did not struggle with the question for long. [[110 旁白 neutral]]
Because he had no power to refuse. In broad daylight, Yu Suzhen simply went for it, tore off his clothes, and took a bite. [[111 旁白 neutral]]
"Hiss!" Lü Yang's teeth chattered as he struggled. "Senior Sister, wait! At least let's change location..." [[112 吕阳 fearful]]
"No need. We'll do it right here!" [[113 玉素真 angry]]
Seeing he couldn't refuse, and remembering he had The Hundred Lives Book as a safety net, Lü Yang simply lay back and stopped resisting. [[114 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, a fierce battle began. [[115 旁白 neutral]]
One was a true demoness of the Demonic Sect, the other a transmigrator with a cheat ability. [[116 旁白 neutral]]
After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. [[117 旁白 neutral]]
Yu Suzhen, however, frowned in dissatisfaction. [[118 旁白 neutral]]
"That's it?" [[119 玉素真 angry]]
"What a waste." [[120 玉素真 angry]]
Yu Suzhen cursed angrily, "You have such a handsome face, but so little vitality. You're already spent so quickly." [[121 玉素真 angry]]
"All show and no substance, just a pretty-faced nobody!" [[122 玉素真 angry]]
Almost at the same time, Lü Yang's face turned pale. [[123 旁白 neutral]]
He then realized that what little vital energy he had left was flowing into Yu Suzhen, and his already frail body became even more withered. [[124 旁白 neutral]]
"The Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra?" [[125 吕阳 surprised]]
The cultivation method assigned to him flashed in his mind, and Lü Yang came to a sudden realization. The so-called test of the Joyful Union Hall was to make the In-name Disciples use the Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra to drain each other, like raising venomous creatures in a jar. Only the last one standing could become a Formal Disciple. [[126 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, several other In-name Disciples approached with fawning looks. [[127 旁白 neutral]]
"Congratulations, Senior Sister Yu! After draining this last one, you should be able to reach the Qi Refining stage." [[128 陌生男1 happy]]
"Once you reach Qi Refining, you are no longer a mortal!" [[129 陌生男2 happy]]
"Please take care of us in the future, Senior Sister. We are willing to serve you." [[130 陌生男3 happy]]
Watching this scene, Lü Yang suddenly laughed. [[131 旁白 neutral]]
"Hehe." [[132 吕阳 happy]]
A useless husk, drained of his essence, suddenly laughing drew everyone's attention. Yu Suzhen glanced at Lü Yang and said coolly, [[133 旁白 neutral]]
"Why are you laughing, Junior Brother?" [[134 玉素真 angry]]
"I'm laughing for you, Senior Sister," Lü Yang said sincerely. "I was worried about your health, but it seems my worries were for nothing." [[135 吕阳 neutral]]
"Worried about my health?" Yu Suzhen was taken aback. [[136 玉素真 surprised]]
"That's right." At this point, Lü Yang sighed with emotion. "Before joining the sect, I spent a lot of time in brothels and caught a venereal disease. You were in such a hurry just now, I didn't have time to tell you. But since you're about to reach Qi Refining, I'm sure a small disease like this won't be a problem for you." [[137 吕阳 neutral]]
Yu Suzhen was speechless. [[138 旁白 neutral]]
[The enraged Yu Suzhen beat you to death.] [[139 旁白 neutral]]
[Current pages remaining in The Hundred Lives Book: 99] [[140 旁白 neutral]]
[Starting a new life, you can choose one of the following gains from your previous life:] [[141 旁白 neutral]]
[One: Treasures.] [[142 旁白 neutral]]
[Two: Cultivation Level.] [[143 旁白 neutral]]
[Three: Lifespan.] [[144 旁白 neutral]]
[Four: Give up all gains and awaken a random talent based on your past life's experience.] [[145 旁白 neutral]]
"Those whose names are called, come before me." [[146 黑衣道人 neutral]]
Lü Yang opened his eyes and saw the Black-Robed Daoist on the stage. He realized he was back in the square where he had first entered the Chu Sheng Sect, being assigned to his hall. [[147 旁白 neutral]]
The recent experience had been so real, the taste of the demoness still vivid in his memory, yet now he was starting all over again. The past events felt like a dream. The stark contrast left Lü Yang stunned for a moment before he came back to his senses, feeling both emotional and secretly joyful. His Hundred Lives Book was truly a wondrous treasure! [[148 旁白 happy]]
Calming himself, Lü Yang looked down at the options in The Hundred Lives Book. [[149 旁白 neutral]]
He skipped the first three options. After all, he had been drained to death by Yu Suzhen before he even started cultivating. The only real choice was the fourth one. [[150 旁白 neutral]]
[Calculating your previous life's experience...] [[151 旁白 neutral]]
[After absorbing you, Yu Suzhen broke through to the Qi Refining realm. Unfortunately, she was afflicted with a venereal disease, and the true qi could not be purged. She was bedridden for several months and eventually died from her illness.] [[152 旁白 neutral]]
[Since ancient times, it is easy to follow the heavens, but difficult to defy them.] [[153 旁白 neutral]]
[Mortal skills cannot compare to divine abilities. The gap between a mortal and a cultivator is vaster than heaven and earth.] [[154 旁白 neutral]]
[However, you entered the game and skillfully used the dual cultivation method. As a mortal, you slew a cultivator. This is a heaven-defying act!] [[155 旁白 neutral]]
[You have awakened the White Talent: Dual Cultivation Prodigy.] [[156 旁白 neutral]]
[Dual Cultivation Prodigy: Your understanding of dual cultivation techniques is extremely high. No cultivator of the same realm can drain you. Forcing it will only result in a backlash against them.] [[157 旁白 neutral]]
Then, the glowing text on the panel changed again. [[158 旁白 neutral]]
[Name: Lv Yang] [[159 旁白 neutral]]
[Age: 18] [[160 旁白 neutral]]
[Cultivation: None] [[161 旁白 neutral]]
[Talent: Dual Cultivation Prodigy (White)] [[162 旁白 neutral]]
[Technique: Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra (Entry)] [[163 旁白 neutral]]
[Abilities: None] [[164 旁白 neutral]]
[Treasures: None] [[165 旁白 neutral]]
[Hundred Lives Book Pages: 99] [[166 旁白 neutral]]
Lü Yang took a deep breath, feeling a surge of energy rush to his dantian. In an instant, his strength was restored, and he felt vigorous. His once weak body gradually recovered. [[167 旁白 happy]]
"The venereal disease... doesn't seem to be cured, but I can last longer." [[168 吕阳 neutral]]
Lü Yang carefully assessed his condition. [[169 旁白 neutral]]
Besides the physical recovery from the talent, Lü Yang also had a much deeper understanding of the Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra given by the Joyful Union Hall. [[170 旁白 neutral]]
After all, practical experience is more important than pure theory, not to mention the talent's bonus. [[171 旁白 neutral]]
After that, everything unfolded as before. [[172 旁白 neutral]]
Because of his handsome face, Lü Yang was still assigned to the Joyful Union Hall. He still met Yu Suzhen at the entrance, and she still took a fancy to him at first sight. [[173 旁白 neutral]]
"What a formidable Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra!" [[174 吕阳 surprised]]
This wicked draining technique could not only absorb a person's primordial yin and yang but could also absorb knowledge and experience from techniques and abilities! [[175 旁白 surprised]]
Thinking of this, Lü Yang became even more enthusiastic. [[176 旁白 neutral]]
One day, two days, three days... [[177 旁白 neutral]]
As time went on, Yu Suzhen's expression slowly changed from enjoyment to terror, and her once-flat belly began to swell... [[178 旁白 neutral]]
"Enough, enough! Stop for a moment!" [[179 玉素真 fearful]]
"I... I've had enough... no, ah!" [[180 玉素真 fearful]]
"I'm sorry, I was wrong, wait..." [[181 玉素真 fearful]]
Ignoring Yu Suzhen's pleas, Lü Yang relentlessly operated the Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra, completely immersed in the pleasure of cultivation. [[182 旁白 neutral]]
And in this process, he felt the existence of "Qi" for the first time. [[183 旁白 surprised]]
This strand of "Qi" was inside Yu Suzhen's body. If they weren't so close at this moment, Lü Yang might not have been able to sense its presence. [[184 旁白 neutral]]
"This thing should be mine!" [[185 吕阳 happy]]
Thinking this, Lü Yang didn't hesitate. He immediately activated the Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra and forcibly extracted all the "Qi" from Yu Suzhen's body. [[186 旁白 neutral]]
"No!!!" [[187 玉素真 fearful]]
Almost at the same time, Yu Suzhen let out a piercing scream, and then her head tilted to one side. [[188 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, Lü Yang felt his own essence merge with that strand of Qi, and with a sudden jolt, it was as if an invisible door had been opened. [[189 旁白 neutral]]
Lü Yang had a flash of insight: "I've broken through!" [[190 吕阳 happy]]
The union of spirit and energy is called "Qi Refining"! [[191 旁白 neutral]]
As a senior In-name Disciple of the Joyful Union Hall, Yu Suzhen was only one step away from Qi Refining. [[192 旁白 neutral]]
In the last life, she drained him, completed the final step, and successfully reached Qi Refining. In this life, she was drained by him instead, and all her accumulation had benefited him. [[193 旁白 neutral]]
From this day on, he was a cultivator at the first layer of Qi Refining! [[194 旁白 happy]]
To break through in one day and be promoted to a Formal Disciple was a huge leap in status. It seemed simple, but for countless years, it had stopped countless In-name Disciples. [[195 旁白 neutral]]
"How delightful. Senior Sister Yu, I will probably never forget you for the rest of my life." [[196 吕阳 happy]]
Lü Yang stood up and looked at the lifeless Yu Suzhen on the ground, unable to hold back a sigh. [[197 旁白 neutral]]
