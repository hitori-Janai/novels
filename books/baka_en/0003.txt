Chapter 3: The Demonic Sect's Way [[199 旁白 neutral]]
When Lv Yang walked out of the quiet room, he discovered that someone was already waiting outside the door. [[200 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang's heart jumped in alarm. The person was dressed in a black Daoist robe with a sinister expression. It was the same Black-Robed Daoist who had assigned him to the Joyful Union Hall! [[201 旁白 surprised]]
"Greetings, Senior Brother." Lv Yang quickly bowed. [[202 吕阳 neutral]]
"You're very good. A real talent." [[203 黑衣道人 neutral]]
The Black-Robed Daoist said with a smile, "I heard that Yu Suzhen brought a very capable young man into her room, and that he was on the verge of breaking through to Qi Refining." [[204 黑衣道人 neutral]]
"But I didn't expect that venomous woman to fail." [[205 黑衣道人 surprised]]
As he said this, the Black-Robed Daoist looked at Lv Yang with a very strange expression. [[206 旁白 neutral]]
Three days, a whole three days! [[207 旁白 surprised]]
Yu Suzhen's cries could be heard even outside the quiet room. Even though the Black-Robed Daoist considered himself experienced, he couldn't help but feel a bit of admiration at this moment. [[208 旁白 neutral]]
If this boy doesn't die, he will surely become a pillar of the sect in the future! [[209 旁白 neutral]]
"Follow me." [[210 黑衣道人 neutral]]
The Black-Robed Daoist's name was Liu Xin. He was a Formal Disciple from Sky Mending Peak, one of the Four Inner Peaks, and was responsible for guiding newly promoted In-name Disciples and explaining sect matters. [[211 旁白 neutral]]
"The Four Outer Halls and the Four Inner Peaks correspond to each other." [[212 刘信 neutral]]
On the way, Liu Xin explained to Lv Yang with interest, "Besides the Sacred Fire Cliff where the Sect Master resides, our sect is mainly centered around the Four Inner Peaks." [[213 刘信 neutral]]
"You came from the Joyful Union Hall, so naturally, you will join my Sky Mending Peak. I'll take you to update the register first." [[214 刘信 neutral]]
With someone to guide him, Lv Yang was more than happy. "Thank you, Senior Brother Liu." [[215 吕阳 happy]]
"It's just my duty." [[216 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin said calmly, "After updating the register, I'll take you to the other three halls. The benefits for Formal Disciples are quite good; consider it a perk from the sect." [[217 刘信 neutral]]
"According to the rules, each Formal Disciple can only receive these benefits once." At this point, Liu Xin's expression turned a bit wistful. "After you enter the inner sect, if you want to get items of the same level, you'll have to complete tasks issued by the sect and earn Contribution Points to exchange for them." [[218 刘信 neutral]]
Lv Yang frowned, "Contribution Points?" [[219 吕阳 surprised]]
"It's the currency issued by the sect," Liu Xin explained. "After you update the register, you should be able to see it on your disciple token." [[220 刘信 neutral]]
Curious, Lv Yang followed Liu Xin to update the register. [[221 旁白 neutral]]
The process was very simple. It just involved moving the Life Lamp he had lit when he first joined from the outer sect area to the inner sect area. [[222 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Lv Yang channeled a strand of true qi into the token at his waist, and a line of text immediately appeared on it: [[223 旁白 neutral]]
"Formal Disciple, Lv Yang." [[224 旁白 neutral]]
"As a Formal Disciple, the sect has gifted you 50 Contribution Points. Contribution Points can be used to exchange for spirit stones, techniques, magical artifacts, cultivation caves, etc." [[225 旁白 neutral]]
"After entering the inner sect, you need to pay Contribution Points to rent a cultivation cave. The rent is 30 Contribution Points per month. Of course, you can also choose to buy a cultivation cave. As a newly promoted inner sect disciple, you can enjoy a 20% down payment discount if you purchase one within ten years." [[226 旁白 neutral]]
—There were more than a dozen pages of such introductions. [[227 旁白 neutral]]
After reading it all carefully, Lv Yang came to a conclusion: "This inner sect is all about money!" [[228 吕阳 neutral]]
With Contribution Points, you could have anything in the world—techniques, pills, and treasures were all available. Without them, you couldn't even afford a place to live. [[229 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Lv Yang also learned what the "benefits" Liu Xin mentioned were. [[230 旁白 neutral]]
After being promoted, every In-name Disciple could use their disciple token to select one magical artifact, one pill, one companion spirit beast, and one dual cultivation partner from the Treasure Refining Hall, Pill Refining Hall, Beast Taming Hall, and Joyful Union Hall, respectively, without paying any Contribution Points. [[231 旁白 neutral]]
"Looking at it this way, it really is a benefit." [[232 吕阳 neutral]]
With a thought, Lv Yang used his disciple token to open the list of exchangeable items, and lines of text appeared. [[233 旁白 neutral]]
Techniques, artifacts, pills, spirit beasts, and cultivation partners—the cheapest all required 100 Contribution Points. [[234 旁白 neutral]]
In contrast, the rewards for sect tasks were pitifully small, mostly in the single digits, with very few reaching double digits. [[235 旁白 neutral]]
From this, it was clear that the free four-item set for promotion was worth at least 400 Contribution Points, a huge sum even for a Formal Disciple. [[236 旁白 neutral]]
While thinking, Lv Yang had already followed Liu Xin to the Treasure Refining Hall. [[237 旁白 neutral]]
The person who received them was named Chen Hao, a deacon of the Treasure Refining Hall. He was said to be a Formal Disciple, and being a deacon was his task. [[238 旁白 neutral]]
According to Liu Xin, this kind of fixed position was the most profitable in the inner sect. Not only did it offer a lot of Contribution Points, enough to support a Formal Disciple, but it was also stable—a true iron rice bowl. Unfortunately, there were too many monks and not enough porridge; you couldn't get such a task without connections. [[239 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Liu? It's been a while." [[240 陈皓 happy]]
Walking into the Treasure Refining Hall, Lv Yang noticed that Chen Hao first glanced at him before turning to Liu Xin and saying warmly, "Bringing a new disciple over again?" [[241 陈皓 happy]]
"That's right." [[242 刘信 happy]]
Liu Xin grinned, his words hinting at something more. "Since you know, why don't you hurry up and bring out the best artifacts in the Treasure Refining Hall for Junior Brother Lv to see?" [[243 刘信 happy]]
"You got it!" [[244 陈皓 happy]]
Chen Hao nodded eagerly and led them into the inner courtyard of the Treasure Refining Hall. But as they walked, Lv Yang frowned in surprise. [[245 旁白 neutral]]
"This... is a disciple's cultivation room, isn't it?" [[246 吕阳 surprised]]
Shouldn't they go to a warehouse or somewhere similar to get an artifact? [[247 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Hao first looked confused, then it dawned on him and he laughed loudly, "Junior Brother Lv, you may not know, but the best artifacts are all in here." [[248 陈皓 happy]]
Before he finished speaking, the three of them stopped in front of a cultivation room. [[249 旁白 neutral]]
"The junior brother in this room has been here for a long time. He was an In-name Disciple in the outer sect for three years. Unfortunately, he was a bit stubborn and went down the wrong path in his cultivation..." [[250 陈皓 neutral]]
After saying this, Chen Hao pushed the door open directly. [[251 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang then saw a Daoist on a cushion in the center of the room, his eyes tightly closed, muttering to himself as if in a dream. [[252 旁白 neutral]]
"I've succeeded... I'm about to succeed..." [[253 陌生男1 happy]]
Then, Chen Hao formed a hand seal, and the Daoist in the room suddenly opened his eyes. His previously dull face was now filled with ecstasy. [[254 旁白 neutral]]
"Haha! I, your Daoist master, have succeeded!" [[255 陌生男1 happy]]
Boom! [[256 旁白 neutral]]
Before he could finish, his entire body exploded, sending flesh and blood flying everywhere. Then, it all flowed back, merging into the skeleton left behind. [[257 旁白 neutral]]
In a short while, a living person had vanished. [[258 旁白 neutral]]
In his place, a "bone sword," as brilliant as jade and perfectly formed, landed gently on the cushion, glowing with the dazzling light of a magical artifact. [[259 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Hao walked forward, picked up the "bone sword," and handed it to Lv Yang, saying with satisfaction, "The artifact 'Bone Jade Sword' is considered a superior item in the 'True Cave Hundred Treasures Book'. This junior brother was indeed a talent. After so many years of hard cultivation, his power was exquisite, otherwise the artifact's spiritual light wouldn't be so pure." [[260 陈皓 happy]]
Lv Yang: "..." [[261 吕阳 neutral]]
Looking at the Bone Jade Sword in Chen Hao's hand and thinking of his own past life, Lv Yang felt a chill to his bones and understood the ways of the Chu Sheng Sect even better. [[262 旁白 fearful]]
It could be summarized in eight words: the weak are prey to the strong, and everything is used to its fullest! [[263 旁白 neutral]]
The sect spends resources to cultivate you In-name Disciples, so you must create value for the sect. If you can't create value, the sect will help you create it! [[264 旁白 neutral]]
If you break through and become a Formal Disciple, everyone is happy. [[265 旁白 neutral]]
If you can't break through, the sect won't support you for a lifetime. Naturally, it will recover the resources it spent on you to ensure it doesn't lose out. [[266 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, in the eyes of the Chu Sheng Sect, some disciples are like clouds, and some are like water. They just do different things. They are all "talents," and there are no "useless" people. [[267 旁白 neutral]]
"This is truly... a sect that lives up to its name." [[268 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang closed his eyes and let out a long breath. Thinking about the Hundred Lives Book he had as a backup, he had already regained his composure when he opened his eyes again. [[269 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother has a good disposition, truly a man of great talent!" [[270 刘信 happy]]
On the other side, seeing Lv Yang calm down so quickly, Liu Xin's eyes first flashed with surprise, and then the smile on his face grew wider. [[271 旁白 neutral]]
Next, Lv Yang followed Liu Xin to the Pill Refining Hall and the Beast Taming Hall, where he received a "Qi Supplementing Pill" and a "Human-Faced Owl." The former could nourish his true qi when consumed, and the latter was like a carrier pigeon, used by Formal Disciples to send messages to each other. [[272 旁白 neutral]]
Only when it came to the last item, the cultivation partner, did Liu Xin have a problem. [[273 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, you broke through too quickly." [[274 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin shook his head and said, "You just joined the outer sect and reached Qi Refining in one day. The speed is too fast. The cultivation partners reserved by the Joyful Union Hall haven't arrived yet." [[275 刘信 neutral]]
"How about you wait a few days, Junior Brother?" [[276 刘信 neutral]]
Lv Yang, of course, didn't care about any cultivation partner. He immediately cupped his hands and said, "I will follow Senior Brother's arrangements." [[277 吕阳 neutral]]
Liu Xin laughed heartily, then took out a jade slip and stuffed it into Lv Yang's hand. "This is the secret true art of our Sky Mending Peak. Take it back and cultivate it well." [[278 刘信 happy]]
Lv Yang took the jade slip and immediately used his spiritual sense to check it. [[279 旁白 neutral]]
In the next second, an incredibly complex technique appeared in his mind. [[280 旁白 neutral]]
