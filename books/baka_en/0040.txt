"Activate the array!" [[3118 吕阳 neutral]]
Above the Skull Mountain Market, the fully restored Hundred Skeletons True Array rumbled to life, startling Wu Zhichong and Duanmu Yuan into pulling away from each other. [[3119 旁白 neutral]]
Seizing the opportunity, Lu Yuanchun transformed into a streak of blood-red light and flew past. [[3120 旁白 neutral]]
The array's patterns on the outside split open, allowing Lu Yuanchun to pass through before quickly closing again, giving no opportunity for outsiders to exploit it. [[3121 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you for your help, Brother Lv." [[3122 陆元淳 neutral]]
Landing inside the array, the blood-red light dissipated, revealing Lu Yuanchun's sorry state. His pale face was filled with shock and uncertainty: [[3123 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Lv, you're an array master?" [[3124 陆元淳 surprised]]
If he were not an array master, how could he have restored the array and resolved a situation of certain death? [[3125 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm flattered, Senior Brother. I'm merely a ninth-grade one." Lv Yang smiled faintly. "After several days of study, I can only unleash a small fraction of this array's power." [[3126 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang spoke modestly, but Lu Yuanchun's expression was solemn. [[3127 旁白 neutral]]
Among the hundred arts of cultivation, the path of arrays is number one! [[3128 旁白 neutral]]
A late-stage Qi Refining cultivator and a late-stage Qi Refining array master were completely different in value. The latter could almost be considered equal to a cultivator at the peak of Qi Refining! [[3129 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way, Senior Brother Lu, you seem to have made quite a gain this time." [[3130 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked at Lu Yuanchun with a faint smile, and under his gaze, Lu Yuanchun's expression stiffened as cold sweat trickled down. [[3131 旁白 neutral]]
However, he regained his composure in the next moment. [[3132 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Lv, I have been keeping the 'Profound Female Grand Yin Treasure Jade' for you for a long time. Today, it's time to return it to its rightful owner!" [[3133 陆元淳 neutral]]
After speaking, Lu Yuanchun took out a small box, opened the lid, and inside lay a white jade stone with seven apertures, closely resembling a human figure. [[3134 旁白 neutral]]
As the saying goes, a wise person submits to circumstances. [[3135 旁白 neutral]]
Lu Yuanchun was an old disciple of the Chu Sheng Sect. He knew very well that if he did not hand over the treasure jade now, he would soon be sacrificed on the front lines of the righteous-demonic battlefield. [[3136 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, with the Shenwu Gate having sent a cultivator at the peak of Qi Refining, escape was impossible. Lu Yuanchun no longer held any illusions. Rather than keeping the treasure, it was better to hand it over publicly. On one hand, it was a way to avert disaster by giving up wealth; on the other, it would shift the Shenwu Gate's attention to Lv Yang. [[3137 旁白 neutral]]
"The Profound Female Grand Yin Treasure Jade." [[3138 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang nodded with satisfaction, put the small box into his storage bag, and turned to look calmly at the figure that had suddenly appeared outside the market. [[3139 旁白 neutral]]
It was a handsome young man holding a spear. [[3140 旁白 neutral]]
He wore a martial crown and scale armor, and his spear was engraved with dragon patterns. He looked less like a cultivator and more like a general from the mortal world. [[3141 旁白 neutral]]
"A ninth-grade array master?" [[3142 欧阳昊泽 surprised]]
The young man's gaze was as sharp as a blade, seeming to pierce through the array's cover to see Lv Yang controlling it. "I did not expect such an unforeseen variable." [[3143 欧阳昊泽 neutral]]
At the same time, 'Divine Fist' Wu Zhichong and 'Mountain-Moving Daoist' Duanmu Yuan came over and bowed respectfully to the spear-wielding young man. "Senior Brother Ouyang, we have failed in our task and disappointed you." [[3144 吴志冲 sad]]
"It's fine." [[3145 欧阳昊泽 neutral]]
Ouyang Haoze shook his head, his expression gentle. "The demonic cultivators are cunning. It's normal for you two junior brothers to be careless. You can make up for it later." [[3146 欧阳昊泽 neutral]]
After speaking, he turned his gaze back to the Skull Mountain Market, his eyes filled with killing intent. [[3147 旁白 neutral]]
"Our sect has planned for many years, and we cannot afford any accidents. If possible, we should first remove the demonic sect's spy that they've left here to minimize any variables." [[3148 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
In the next moment, Ouyang Haoze's figure flashed as he fully unleashed his aura of the peak Qi Refining realm. Instantly, a pillar of vital energy shot up like wolf smoke, manifesting with earth-shaking battle cries. Vaguely, thousands of armored soldiers could be seen arrayed behind him, empowering his spirit. [[3149 旁白 neutral]]
"Break for me!" [[3150 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Instantly, a thunderous sound rolled through the air and crashed into the Skull Mountain Market. A few cultivators with lower cultivation levels were immediately shaken to the point of vomiting blood by the furious shout. [[3151 旁白 neutral]]
"Peak of Qi Refining..." [[3152 吕阳 fearful]]
Lv Yang controlled the array with a grave expression. The pinnacle of the Qi Refining realm symbolized not only cultivation level in major sects, but also status. [[3153 旁白 neutral]]
Anyone who reached the peak of Qi Refining was certain to be a true disciple of their sect! [[3154 旁白 neutral]]
The Shenwu Gate was located in the Northern Frontier. Although it was much smaller than the Chu Sheng Sect, it possessed several world-shaking great divine abilities that only true disciples could cultivate. [[3155 旁白 neutral]]
"If he has mastered a great divine ability, I'll abandon the array and run immediately." [[3156 旁白 neutral]]
While preparing to escape, Lv Yang moved to the edge of the array and confronted Ouyang Haoze from across the barrier. "I am Lv Yang. May I know your name, fellow Daoist?" [[3157 吕阳 neutral]]
"You are not worthy to know my name." Ouyang Haoze sneered. "If you know what's good for you, surrender at once. In that case, I might spare your lives, only crippling your demonic cultivation. If you choose to resist, the day the array breaks will be the day no one is left alive!" [[3158 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
"When will this cycle of vengeance end?" [[3159 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's smile did not change, his tone gentle. "Although our two sides are righteous and demonic, we have always minded our own business. Why not give me some face?" [[3160 吕阳 neutral]]
"Give you face?" [[3161 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Ouyang Haoze burst out laughing, mocking him, "Such arrogance! You're just at the eighth layer of Qi Refining. What can you do if I don't give you face today?" [[3162 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
"Why must it be this way..." [[3163 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang shook his head. "In that case, please try to break the array, fellow Daoist." [[3164 吕阳 neutral]]
"You're courting death!" [[3165 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
A flash of killing intent crossed Ouyang Haoze's eyes. The wolf smoke formed by his vital energy retracted, and he threw a punch that, at first glance, looked like a mortal's martial art. [[3166 旁白 neutral]]
However, seeing this, Lv Yang's expression tensed, not daring to be careless. He immediately summoned the Blood Sun Sword Pellet, merged with its sword light, and slashed at Ouyang Haoze. Instantly, fist and sword clashed. Unmatched sharpness and fist energy exploded outwards like fireworks in mid-air. [[3167 旁白 neutral]]
Ouyang Haoze's movements were like lightning, throwing hundreds of punches in the blink of an eye. [[3168 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike other cultivation sects, the Shenwu Gate was dominated by body cultivators, and most of their divine abilities were based on fists and kicks. Their close-quarters combat speed was even faster than that of sword cultivators! [[3169 旁白 neutral]]
"Arrow Volley!" [[3170 欧阳昊泽 angry]]
Ouyang Haoze spread his arms as if drawing a large bow. Then, fist shadows shot out like arrows, submerging Lv Yang's position in an instant. [[3171 旁白 neutral]]
Boom! [[3172 旁白 neutral]]
Amidst the explosions, Lv Yang felt as if the spiritual energy around him was being drained, replaced by endless fist shadows aiming to grind him to dust! [[3173 旁白 neutral]]
A thousand strikes in an instant, leaving no room for a counter-attack. This was clearly a high-level divine ability! [[3174 旁白 neutral]]
Although Ouyang Haoze spoke arrogantly and looked down on Lv Yang, he held nothing back when he attacked, using his full strength. [[3175 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, explosive waves of energy rolled out. [[3176 旁白 neutral]]
Under his barrage of fists, Lv Yang lasted less than ten seconds before being smashed to pieces. His sword light shattered, and he turned into a sky full of withered bones and remains. [[3177 旁白 neutral]]
The barrage of fists stopped. Ouyang Haoze stood in the air, frowning slightly. [[3178 旁白 neutral]]
On the other side, above the market, the Hundred Skeletons True Array activated. A figure materialized from thin air and stepped out. It was the unharmed Lv Yang. [[3179 旁白 neutral]]
"Fellow Daoist's fists are powerful. I am impressed." [[3180 吕阳 neutral]]
Ouyang Haoze did not respond and punched again, using the same Arrow Volley. Lv Yang resisted again, and was again smashed to pieces after about ten seconds. [[3181 旁白 neutral]]
However, in the next moment, Ouyang Haoze saw Lv Yang's body turn into withered bones, while an uninjured Lv Yang once again stepped out of the array. His sleeves fluttered, his style as elegant as before, without the slightest loss of true energy or magical power. He bowed to him and said, "Do you wish to fight again, fellow Daoist?" [[3182 吕阳 neutral]]
"...The Hundred Skeletons True Array truly lives up to its name." [[3183 欧阳昊泽 neutral]]
Ouyang Haoze's expression was grave. [[3184 旁白 neutral]]
As far as he knew, this was a seventh-grade array that contained one hundred skeleton soldiers. A cultivator inside the array could use the bodies of the skeleton soldiers to manifest and fight with their full power. [[3185 旁白 neutral]]
This meant that the skeleton soldiers were fighting in place of the cultivator's real body. [[3186 旁白 neutral]]
If they won, everyone was happy. If they died, it had no effect on the main body. Moreover, as long as the array continued to operate, even consumed skeleton soldiers could be quickly restored. [[3187 旁白 neutral]]
Thus, no matter how fiercely he attacked, it was all in vain. This was only because he was outside the array and had not rushed in. Otherwise, if he had entered, Lv Yang could have summoned all the skeleton soldiers to swarm him. At that point, even a cultivator at the peak of Qi Refining would suffer greatly! [[3188 旁白 neutral]]
