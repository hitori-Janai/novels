Chapter 38: Shenwu Gate [[2962 旁白 neutral]]
At dusk, inside the Blood-Robed Tower. [[2963 旁白 neutral]]
The setting sun was like blood. As another cycle of cultivation ended, Lv Yang slowly refined the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into his Dantian, then transformed it into True Qi that flowed to his limbs and bones. [[2964 旁白 neutral]]
The Qi moved through his meridians like a dragon returning to the sea. [[2965 旁白 neutral]]
"Soon. Once I master the final Flying Fish Transformation and combine the nine transformations, I will have completely refined the third-grade True Qi of the 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art'—the 'True Dragon Sha'." [[2966 吕阳 neutral]]
"When I master the 'True Dragon Sha,' it will be about time for the great war between the righteous and demonic sects to begin. It will be perfect timing, allowing me to compete for the Foundation Establishment opportunity at Skull Mountain in my strongest state. Only the Foundation Establishment opportunity is worth the risk and the fight. Everything else is meaningless." [[2967 吕阳 neutral]]
After finishing his cultivation for the day, Lv Yang walked out of the quiet room. [[2968 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the quiet room, a woman with a proud posture and sharp eyes had been waiting for a long time. Upon seeing Lv Yang, she immediately came forward and handed him a jade slip. [[2969 旁白 neutral]]
"Dao Brother, the movements of the corpse tide for today have arrived." [[2970 云妙清 neutral]]
Lv Yang took the jade slip and smiled slightly, "Thank you, Fellow Daoist Yun." [[2971 吕阳 neutral]]
This woman was, in fact, Yun Miaoqing. [[2972 旁白 neutral]]
She was originally a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion. Although Lv Yang had already learned the Divine Firmament Sword Art, he still bought her because of their connection in a past life. [[2973 旁白 neutral]]
To be fair, he originally felt that since they had actually practiced dual cultivation in a past life, he didn't mind doing a good deed and helping Yun Miaoqing, as long as it didn't hinder him. Following him was better than being bought by other Chu Sheng Sect disciples and used as a cauldron until she was drained into a husk. [[2974 旁白 neutral]]
However, he didn't expect this decision to bring him a pleasant surprise. [[2975 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because he hadn't practiced dual cultivation with Yun Miaoqing in this life and instead treated her with respect like a guest, focusing only on his hard training, her favorability towards him had greatly increased. [[2976 旁白 neutral]]
"Dao Brother, you are a good person. Why must you stay in the Chu Sheng Sect?" [[2977 云妙清 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing walked to Lv Yang's side and whispered, "Right now, the corpse tide is breaking out. Senior Brother, why don't you fake your death and come with me to the Sword Pavilion to join the righteous path..." [[2978 云妙清 neutral]]
As she spoke, Yun Miaoqing looked at Lv Yang, her beautiful eyes filled with affection. [[2979 旁白 neutral]]
In her most desperate and helpless moments, it was the person before her who saved her from a sea of suffering. Not only did he not harm her in the slightest, but he also gave her a place to stay. [[2980 旁白 neutral]]
Although he came from a demonic sect, he was a perfect gentleman. [[2981 旁白 neutral]]
Not to mention, over ten years, she had watched him grow step by step. He had a high cultivation level, strong talent, and most importantly, he was very handsome. [[2982 旁白 neutral]]
If he could join the Sword Pavilion, perhaps she could... [[2983 旁白 neutral]]
As she thought about it, a blush suddenly appeared on Yun Miaoqing's pretty face. It was unclear what she was thinking about. [[2984 旁白 neutral]]
This behavior made Lv Yang recall how she had looked at him with an unyielding face and called him a demon lord in previous lives. For a moment, he found it quite interesting. [[2985 吕阳 neutral]]
Of course, he had no interest in romance. [[2986 旁白 neutral]]
What he truly valued was that Yun Miaoqing's status in the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion seemed to be quite high. She actually claimed that if she recommended him, the Sword Pavilion would surely accept him. [[2987 旁白 neutral]]
"Cultivating in the Chu Sheng Sect is like walking on thin ice. If possible, I would rather go to a sect with a better culture." [[2988 吕阳 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing might be his stepping stone to join the righteous path in the future. [[2989 旁白 neutral]]
"How are Senior Sister Feixia and the others?" [[2990 吕阳 neutral]]
"Those few demonic cultivators broke through the corpse tide at Jueyin Ridge a few days ago. A mysterious expert also appeared, but they were repelled and chased away." [[2991 云妙清 neutral]]
Yun Miaoqing handed over another jade slip. [[2992 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang took the jade slip, and with a sweep of his spiritual sense, the scenes from that day immediately appeared in his mind. [[2993 旁白 neutral]]
"I see... It seems there really is a mastermind behind the early outbreak of the corpse tide. Disciples of the Shenwu Gate? And the strange treasure they used to accelerate the corpse tide is..." [[2994 吕阳 surprised]]
At this point, Lv Yang suddenly froze and then shot to his feet. [[2995 旁白 neutral]]
"Mysterious Female Grand Yin Treasure Jade!?" [[2996 吕阳 surprised]]
That's right, the intelligence clearly showed that the masterminds behind the corpse tide outbreak, the disciples of the Shenwu Gate, possessed a thumb-sized Mysterious Female Grand Yin Treasure Jade! [[2997 旁白 neutral]]
"If I can get this treasure jade, I can immediately master the Mysterious Yin Form-Grabbing Great Art. With time, even the 'Grand Yin Form-Shedding Corpse Liberation True Art' would not be a dream. Considering the rarity of the treasure jade, this is probably my only chance in this life. If I give up, I will likely miss it forever." [[2998 吕阳 neutral]]
"But... if not in this life, then in the next. If I miss it, I miss it!" [[2999 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang's expression turned grim, and he sat back down. Despite unexpectedly discovering the Grand Yin Treasure Jade he had dreamed of, he felt no joy at all. [[3000 旁白 neutral]]
He only felt a bone-chilling cold and his heart was filled with vigilance. [[3001 旁白 neutral]]
"Whatever I want, it just gets delivered to my door. How can there be such a lucky thing in the world? After all, I'm not a child of destiny like Xiao Shiye." [[3002 吕阳 fearful]]
Moreover, even Xiao Shiye's luck was granted by someone else! [[3003 旁白 neutral]]
"Could it be that Hongyun Daoist again?" [[3004 吕阳 fearful]]
The thought that this might all be the work of a Foundation Establishment expert manipulating fate and plotting in the shadows made Lv Yang decide immediately. [[3005 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm not going out!" [[3006 吕阳 angry]]
The situation at Skull Mountain was treacherous. It was safest to stay in the marketplace and control the formation. As long as a Foundation Establishment expert didn't intervene, he was as solid as a mountain. [[3007 旁白 neutral]]
"Besides, just because I don't go out doesn't mean I have no chance of getting the treasure jade." [[3008 吕阳 neutral]]
Weren't Fairy Feixia and the others still out there? [[3009 旁白 neutral]]
After all, the report said they had chased after them. If they could seize the treasure jade and escape back to the marketplace, wouldn't that be his chance? [[3010 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang couldn't help but cheer for Fairy Feixia from the bottom of his heart. [[3011 旁白 neutral]]
Time flew by. [[3012 旁白 neutral]]
Another day, inside the Blood-Robed Tower. [[3013 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang was meditating and refining Qi when he suddenly felt something. He rode a streak of light out of the tower and gazed into the distance, looking towards the outskirts of the marketplace. [[3014 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom! Boom! Boom!" [[3015 旁白 neutral]]
In the distant sky, a series of thunderous explosions, accompanied by blooming mushroom clouds, rapidly spread from the horizon towards the marketplace. It was a chase scene. Leading the chase was Fairy Feixia's very distinctive rosy-cloud escape light. [[3016 旁白 neutral]]
"One of them is missing?" [[3017 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang raised an eyebrow. The Skull Mountain marketplace had four late-stage Qi Refiners, including himself: Fairy Feixia, Lu Yanchun, and an unnamed senior brother. [[3018 旁白 neutral]]
But now, Lv Yang could only see the figures of Fairy Feixia and Lu Yanchun. [[3019 旁白 neutral]]
"Activate the formation." [[3020 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang calmly gave the order. The Chu Sheng Sect disciples in the marketplace immediately took their positions, and formation flags flew, instantly raising a magnificent formation. [[3021 旁白 neutral]]
The Hundred Skeletons True Great Formation! [[3022 旁白 neutral]]
This was a seventh-grade formation, a top-tier formation at the Qi Refining level. With Lv Yang controlling it, he could even fight a cultivator at the Great Perfection of Qi Refining. [[3023 旁白 neutral]]
But in the next second, something unexpected happened! [[3024 旁白 neutral]]
Lu Yanchun suddenly took out a token, activated it with a hand seal, and directly opened a gap in the originally closed formation. [[3025 旁白 surprised]]
"Now!" [[3026 陆元淳 neutral]]
Almost at the same time, an excited shout came from outside the marketplace. Then, several streaks of spiritual light flew out, turning into formation flags and spreading out in all directions. [[3027 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a small formation appeared at the gap Lu Yanchun had opened, fixing it in place so that even Lv Yang couldn't close it! [[3028 旁白 neutral]]
"Shenwu Gate..." [[3029 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang frowned slightly, immediately recognizing the attackers. It was clear that the Shenwu Gate had been ambushing outside the marketplace for a long time, just waiting for such an opportunity. [[3030 旁白 neutral]]
Now that the formation had been forced open, the Shenwu Gate could charge into the marketplace! [[3031 旁白 neutral]]
The culprit behind all this, Lu Yanchun, just gave the marketplace a cold look, then flew away in the opposite direction! [[3032 旁白 neutral]]
He obviously knew what he had done, but he didn't care. In fact, he had done it on purpose, using the marketplace as a pawn so he could escape. For the Shenwu Gate, it was better to seize this great opportunity to destroy the Skull Mountain marketplace than to continue chasing him. [[3033 旁白 neutral]]
As for the fellow disciples of the Chu Sheng Sect in the marketplace? [[3034 旁白 neutral]]
It was just their bad luck! [[3035 旁白 neutral]]
