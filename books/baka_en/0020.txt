Chapter 20: Xiao Shiye [[1593 旁白 neutral]]
Nearly three months later, in the Earthfire Furnace Room. [[1594 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang's body trembled as he slowly stood up. [[1595 旁白 neutral]]
No, to say he was standing was not quite right. "Floating" was perhaps a better word, because at this moment, he no longer had flesh, muscle, or bone. He was just a crimson blood shadow! [[1596 旁白 surprised]]
"I succeeded!" [[1597 吕阳 happy]]
The blood shadow had no face. A slightly distorted voice came from the vibrations of the glowing light: "After eighty-one days, I have finally refined it!" [[1598 吕阳 happy]]
The next moment, the blood shadow gradually retracted. The skin that had been peeled off the floor flew up and was "worn" by the shadow. The pale skin was filled with blood, and the shriveled flesh became full again. Soon, a perfectly intact Lv Yang appeared in the furnace room. [[1599 旁白 neutral]]
At first glance, he looked no different from an ordinary person. [[1600 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to three months ago, Lv Yang's aura was even more powerful. His abundant true qi had even condensed into a Qi Seed. [[1601 旁白 neutral]]
Seventh level of Qi Refining! Late stage! [[1602 旁白 surprised]]
Perhaps the process of cultivating the divine ability was too painful, an unimaginable trial for his essence, qi, and spirit. This was what allowed him to unexpectedly break through his cultivation bottleneck. [[1603 旁白 neutral]]
Even more fortunately, this happened before he had officially perfected the divine ability. [[1604 旁白 happy]]
If it had happened after he perfected the ability, breaking through the bottleneck would have been useless. For example, now, his cultivation was permanently stuck at the seventh level of Qi Refining. [[1605 旁白 neutral]]
"But this is enough." [[1606 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang murmured to himself. With the [Hundred Lives Book], he never focused on the achievements of one life. His goal was to use what he learned for the next life. [[1607 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's test its power!" [[1608 吕阳 happy]]
As the thought crossed Lv Yang's mind, a magnificent sword pellet appeared between his eyebrows. His figure then transformed into a streak of blood-red light and merged with the sword pellet. [[1609 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom!" [[1610 旁白 neutral]]
Outside Ten Thousand Treasures Peak, the ground shook violently. The bustling crowd swayed, and several people fell to the ground. [[1611 旁白 neutral]]
"What's going on?" [[1612 陌生男1 surprised]]
"An earthquake... Impossible. With the Masters suppressing the earth veins, how could there be an earthquake?" [[1613 陌生男2 surprised]]
The disciples looked at each other. Those with higher cultivation levels suddenly sensed something and looked in a certain direction, their eyes filling with surprise. [[1614 旁白 neutral]]
"Look!" [[1615 陌生女1 surprised]]
"That is..." [[1616 陌生男1 surprised]]
Everyone's eyes followed the voice. [[1617 旁白 neutral]]
Then, everyone saw a rainbow of light shoot out from a furnace room, piercing the sun. In the blink of an eye, it leaped into the sky, causing the sea of clouds to churn wherever it passed. [[1618 旁白 neutral]]
Clang! Clang! [[1619 旁白 neutral]]
The clear sound of a sword echoed through the heavens. A dense red light dyed Ten Thousand Treasures Peak the color of blood, stirring the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into a monstrous wave! [[1620 旁白 neutral]]
In the midst of such a tide of spiritual energy, most disciples could not even breathe, nearly suffocating. [[1621 旁白 fearful]]
"Such power... Is this the late stage of Qi Refining?" [[1622 陌生男1 surprised]]
A disciple showed a look of envy: "He has already formed a Qi Seed. With just one final step of nurturing it, he can reach completion. After that, Foundation Establishment will be within reach." [[1623 陌生男2 neutral]]
"I wonder which Senior Brother has broken through?" [[1624 陌生女1 neutral]]
"I've seen Senior Brothers in the late stage of Qi Refining before, but none had such spiritual pressure. That rainbow-like sword light must be an extraordinary magic treasure..." [[1625 陌生男3 neutral]]
Meanwhile, above the sea of clouds. [[1626 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang, as a blood shadow merged with the sword light, spread his spiritual sense in all directions. Everything within a radius of over ten miles was perfectly clear, as if he were looking at the lines on his own palm. [[1627 旁白 neutral]]
"Late-stage Qi Refining. True qi sinks into the dantian and forms a Qi Seed, causing a transformation of essence, qi, and spirit. If I still had a body, my physical form would have taken a great leap. I would be immune to blades and spears, and my true qi would be dozens of times stronger. It's a pity that only my spiritual sense is left." [[1628 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang was feeling emotional when his eyebrows suddenly raised. [[1629 旁白 neutral]]
"Who's there?" [[1630 吕阳 angry]]
Before Lv Yang's voice faded, his sword followed his thought. The blood-red rainbow of sword light tore through the sea of clouds, revealing a young, handsome figure. [[1631 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, don't attack! Don't attack!" [[1632 萧石叶 fearful]]
The person shouted loudly, but Lv Yang paid no attention. The sword light charged forward. Seeing this, the person quickly took out a small flag and held it up in the air. [[1633 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, the flag unfurled, transforming into a pair of gates. [[1634 旁白 neutral]]
The person hid behind one gate. After Lv Yang's sword light followed him in, he came out from the other gate and then waved his hand. [[1635 旁白 neutral]]
The gates disappeared, turning back into a small flag. [[1636 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang's eyebrows raised. He realized his sword light had been trapped in a strange place, allowing the person to escape. [[1637 旁白 surprised]]
"Interesting." [[1638 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang grinned, and the sword pellet between his eyebrows shook violently, like rolling thunder. In an instant, it split into dozens, even hundreds, of sword lights, like a peacock spreading its tail. [[1639 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, the young man, who had been feeling a bit proud, turned pale. He quickly took out the small flag to protect himself and shouted, "Senior Brother, my name is Xiao Shiye. I came here only to make your acquaintance, with no ill intentions. Please, withdraw your divine ability." [[1640 萧石叶 fearful]]
"Xiao Shiye?" [[1641 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang was stunned. The sword lights that were about to erupt suddenly stopped in mid-air, reflecting a face covered in cold sweat. [[1642 旁白 neutral]]
That pre-selected lucky guy? [[1643 旁白 surprised]]
The next second, Lv Yang withdrew the sword light and transformed into his human form, landing in front of Xiao Shiye. He laughed heartily, "Junior Brother, don't misunderstand. I was just playing with you!" [[1644 吕阳 happy]]
Xiao Shiye wiped the sweat from his forehead. He complained in his heart, thinking that Lv Yang had clearly intended to get serious. But on his face, he showed a brilliant smile and said eagerly, "Senior Brother, your divine abilities are vast, your power is boundless. I am truly impressed. This is just a small gift, please don't refuse it." [[1645 萧石叶 fearful]]
After speaking, he handed over the small flag in his hand. [[1646 旁白 neutral]]
"How can I accept this..." [[1647 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang shook his head while taking the small flag. Only then did he see two words on its surface, "Void-Evasion," embroidered with golden thread. [[1648 旁白 neutral]]
"This treasure is called the Void-Evasion Flag." [[1649 萧石叶 neutral]]
Xiao Shiye took the initiative to explain: "I bought it from an antique shop before joining the sect. At first, it showed no special properties, but after joining, I discovered it was a wondrous treasure." [[1650 萧石叶 neutral]]
"The flag has two sides. When activated, it can transform into two gates of life and death." [[1651 萧石叶 neutral]]
"Among those at the same cultivation level, as long as you enter through the death gate and exit through the life gate, you can find a way to survive even the greatest danger, untouched by disaster." [[1652 萧石叶 neutral]]
Lv Yang's face twitched as he listened. [[1653 旁白 angry]]
Such a miraculous magic treasure was something this Xiao Shiye had casually bought from a mortal antique shop before he even started cultivating in the sect? [[1654 旁白 surprised]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang's thoughts stirred, and he focused his spiritual sense into his eyes. [[1655 旁白 neutral]]
In the late stage of Qi Refining, his spiritual sense had grown much stronger and naturally had many new uses. What Lv Yang was using now was a wondrous technique called "Qi-Gazing Art." [[1656 旁白 neutral]]
The result of his looking was startling. Lv Yang's eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets. [[1657 旁白 surprised]]
In his eyes, Xiao Shiye's entire body—his Daoist robe, boots, clothes, cap, and even the belt around his waist—was glowing with the light of treasures! [[1658 旁白 surprised]]
In terms of quality, they were probably no worse than his own sword pellet! [[1659 旁白 surprised]]
Even with Lv Yang's current state of mind, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unfairness. [[1660 旁白 angry]]
After all, the magic treasure he had spent months and a fortune to refine was as common as cabbage on Xiao Shiye's body. It was hard not to feel jealous. [[1661 旁白 angry]]
"This person has such great luck..." [[1662 吕阳 surprised]]
If Lv Yang had previously thought that Xiao Shiye winning the grand prize in the merit pool was due to some secret manipulation, he now changed his mind. [[1663 旁白 neutral]]
Could it really be that he's just that lucky? [[1664 吕阳 surprised]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang's expression gradually became strange. [[1665 旁白 neutral]]
With such great luck, it meant that by following him, one could surely get a lot of opportunities. And his cultivation level wasn't high, making it very easy to rob him... [[1666 旁白 happy]]
This Xiao Shiye... he seems like a great asset! [[1667 吕阳 happy]]
