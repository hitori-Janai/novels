Chapter 30: The Peak Master of Sky Mending Peak [[2360 旁白 neutral]]
In his previous life, Lv Yang had painstakingly studied array formations. The grand formation he finally inscribed on the Blood Sun Sword Pellet was a sword formation called the "Bloodwash Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram." [[2361 旁白 neutral]]
The formation was complex. Its main power came from a river of sword qi from the Blood Sun Sword Pellet, supported by the Heaven Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light. Lv Yang had also designed 360 key points in the formation. He planned to place 360 cultivators in these points to unleash the formation's full power. [[2362 旁白 neutral]]
He already had a plan for this. [[2363 旁白 neutral]]
Once he took back his Primordial Qi Myriad Spirits Banner from Liu Xin, he would let the banner spirits control the formation's key points. This would be easier and portable. [[2364 旁白 neutral]]
But for now, he had to control the formation himself. [[2365 旁白 neutral]]
"Open!" Lv Yang performed a hand seal. The Blood Sun Sword Pellet hummed, and a celestial river surged from south to north, covering the sky and stretching beyond sight. [[2366 吕阳 neutral]]
Lu Yuanchun, Zhao Xuhe, and all the others were now trapped in the celestial river. The rushing water was like countless sword strikes attacking them every second. A few weaker cultivators only had time to scream before they turned into blossoms of blood in the river. [[2367 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Lu Yuanchun's expression changed drastically. [[2368 旁白 surprised]]
"This is impossible! Master said he knew formations, but I didn't give him any time to set one up. How did we still get trapped in it?" [[2369 陆元淳 surprised]]
Lu Yuanchun could not understand. [[2370 旁白 neutral]]
The Blood Sun Sword Pellet was not an ordinary magic treasure, but a formation treasure. It used the formation as the treasure itself. The formation appeared with a single thought, requiring no setup time. [[2371 旁白 neutral]]
Being trapped in the formation was beyond Lu Yuanchun's expectations. [[2372 旁白 neutral]]
After all, formations borrowed the power of heaven and earth and were said to be unbeatable against those at the same cultivation level. Although he was confident in his own strength, being trapped in a formation shook his confidence. [[2373 旁白 neutral]]
Could he really fail so miserably today? [[2374 陆元淳 fearful]]
At this thought, Lu Yuanchun's expression grew uglier, losing its earlier confidence. Even Zhao Xuhe beside him became anxious. [[2375 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, this formation..." [[2376 赵旭河 fearful]]
"Be careful, Junior Brother. Things might not go as planned today," Lu Yuanchun whispered as he summoned a golden mirror to protect himself. [[2377 陆元淳 neutral]]
Lu Yuanchun still held onto a sliver of hope. He thought Lv Yang was just a lucky disciple. Although he knew many things, he was still new. Even if he knew formations, how well could he master them? This formation might be something he inherited. [[2378 旁白 neutral]]
However, in the next second, Lv Yang shattered his illusion. [[2379 旁白 neutral]]
With a cold expression, Lv Yang pointed a finger. The clear river of sword qi instantly turned a piercing scarlet color. [[2380 旁白 neutral]]
The Heaven Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light! [[2381 旁白 surprised]]
This divine ability was incredibly powerful, said to "injure on a graze, and kill on a touch," but that also meant it was only effective if it hit its target. [[2382 旁白 neutral]]
If it missed, it was useless. [[2383 旁白 neutral]]
But inside the "Bloodwash Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram," Lv Yang had solved this problem. Being inside the formation was like being soaked in the divine light! [[2384 旁白 neutral]]
In other words, as soon as he used it, it was a guaranteed hit! [[2385 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, Lu Yuanchun felt the world shake. The remaining junior brothers screamed one after another, and in a moment, they were turned into nothing but human skins! [[2386 旁白 fearful]]
"Not good!" [[2387 陆元淳 fearful]]
Lu Yuanchun's face changed dramatically. He gritted his teeth, changed his hand seal, and the energy from the golden mirror above his head became chaotic and violent. [[2388 旁白 angry]]
Lv Yang understood immediately with just a glance. [[2389 旁白 neutral]]
"Self-destructing your magic treasure? Naive!" [[2390 吕阳 neutral]]
The Golden Light Treasure Mirror was clearly a high-quality magic treasure. If Lu Yuanchun blew it up, he might be able to tear open the formation and create an escape path. [[2391 旁白 neutral]]
But that was only if Lv Yang didn't understand formations. [[2392 旁白 neutral]]
A normal formation, even with someone controlling it, can only run by its fixed rules. It is a dead formation. However, a formation with a formation master is completely different. [[2393 旁白 neutral]]
A qualified formation master can adjust the formation in real-time based on the battle, turning a dead formation into a living one. Its power is on a different level. Furthermore, Lv Yang himself created the "Bloodwash Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram," so he could use it as easily as moving his own limbs. [[2394 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, the moment Lu Yuanchun began to detonate his treasure, Lv Yang made his move. [[2395 旁白 neutral]]
With one hand, he made calculations. With the other, he manipulated the formation's patterns, instantly spreading the blast's focused power to all corners of the formation. [[2396 旁白 neutral]]
Once the explosion was scattered, its power was reduced several times. [[2397 旁白 neutral]]
The formation, which should have been broken, remained unharmed. It even used the moment the mirror shattered to swallow Lu Yuanchun and Zhao Xuhe. [[2398 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe was turned into a dried corpse before he could even scream. [[2399 旁白 fearful]]
"Impossible! This thief is a formation master!?" [[2400 陆元淳 fearful]]
Lu Yuanchun's face was pale. He felt his flesh and blood pouring out like a flood from a broken dam. He was about to die just like Zhao Xuhe. [[2401 旁白 fearful]]
"Blood-Transforming Divine Light..." [[2402 陆元淳 fearful]]
In this life-or-death moment, intense fear extinguished his anger. Lu Yuanchun stared with furious eyes but was helpless. Finally, as if accepting his fate, he lowered his head. [[2403 旁白 sad]]
Boom! [[2404 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, a jade pendant on Lu Yuanchun's waist shattered, releasing a brilliant light that instantly broke through Lv Yang's formation! [[2405 旁白 surprised]]
Lv Yang's pupils shrank at the sight, and he looked up at the sky. [[2406 旁白 surprised]]
Where he looked, the brilliant light formed a giant, calm, and majestic face in the sky, tens of thousands of feet above him! [[2407 旁白 surprised]]
The face showed no emotion. Its eyes were as bright as the sun and moon. Just one glance made Lv Yang's eyes sting and water. His true qi was reduced by seventy to eighty percent, and he almost fell from the sky. [[2408 旁白 fearful]]
The face looked down, its voice like thunder from a mountain: [[2409 旁白 neutral]]
"Insolent!" [[2410 补天峰主 angry]]
The voice was not loud, but it sounded like a divine law, making Lv Yang a being hated by the world. The surrounding spiritual energy even seemed to flee from him. [[2411 旁白 fearful]]
The invisible gaze seemed to press down on Lv Yang with the weight of a mountain. [[2412 旁白 fearful]]
The ground around him began to crack. [[2413 旁白 fearful]]
Such a scene naturally alarmed the entire Sky Mending Peak. [[2414 旁白 neutral]]
Disciples in seclusion all over Sky Mending Peak were awakened. They walked out of their cave residences and looked at the giant face in the sky with fear. [[2415 旁白 fearful]]
"Greetings, Peak Master!" [[2416 陌生人 fearful]]
"Greetings, Peak Master!" [[2417 陌生人 fearful]]
Some of the older disciples of Sky Mending Peak recognized the face. Their scalps tingled, and they immediately knelt on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly. [[2418 旁白 fearful]]
The Peak Master of Sky Mending Peak! [[2419 旁白 surprised]]
Lv Yang finally knew the identity of Zhao Xuhe's mysterious master: the Peak Master of Sky Mending Peak, a Foundation Establishment Perfected Being who controlled one of the Four Inner Peaks of the Chu Sheng Sect! [[2420 旁白 surprised]]
Rumble! [[2421 旁白 neutral]]
As the voice fell, the formation diagram that Lv Yang had painstakingly created in his previous life began to crumble. Large sections of the formation patterns exploded on the spot. [[2422 旁白 fearful]]
Seeing this, Lv Yang couldn't help but show a helpless expression. [[2423 吕阳 sad]]
The gap between Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment was far beyond his imagination. The result of his twenty years of hard work could not even withstand two words from a Foundation Establishment Perfected Being! [[2424 旁白 sad]]
A single soft rebuke could be so devastating? [[2425 吕阳 surprised]]
