Chapter 1: The Hundred Lives Book [[1 旁白 neutral]]
Demonic Sect, Chu Sheng Sect. [[2 旁白 neutral]]
A vast sea of clouds surged like angry waves. Many mountain peaks stood like islands in the clouds, scattered like pieces on a chessboard. [[3 旁白 neutral]]
On the edge of the board, there was a shorter mountain. It looked as if someone had cut off its peak, leaving a flat top. On that flat top, flying boats landed and took off, and the new in-name disciples were standing in a line. [[4 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang was one of them. [[5 旁白 neutral]]
He had just transmigrated and appeared here as soon as he opened his eyes. The lingering memories in his body told him that his current situation was not very good. [[6 旁白 neutral]]
According to the body's original memories, the Chu Sheng Sect ruled over a state named "Chen." [[7 旁白 neutral]]
Every three years, the State of Chen sent a group of in-name disciples to the Chu Sheng Sect. In exchange, the sect ensured the state had good weather and a stable royal family. [[8 旁白 neutral]]
At first, this sounded like a great opportunity to join a celestial sect and live forever. [[9 旁白 neutral]]
However, in reality, no officials or nobles from the State of Chen wanted to come. Only poor people like Lv Yang were sent over as "blood offerings." [[10 旁白 neutral]]
After all, thousands of in-name disciples were sent to the Chu Sheng Sect every three years, but the number of formal disciples never really grew. The in-name disciples vanished without a trace, one after another. It was as if they were going to a bottomless abyss, not a holy land for cultivation. [[11 旁白 fearful]]
Just thinking about it was enough to make one shiver in fear. [[12 旁白 fearful]]
"No wonder I'm so weak. I feel like my body has been hollowed out." [[13 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang squeezed his arm. It was all soft flesh, without any muscle. He felt even worse. When he tried to stand up, a sharp pain came from his chest. [[14 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems the original owner of this body was sick, and this illness is... Fuck!" [[15 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang cursed a few more times. This was no longer just about weakness; he was fatally ill and didn't seem to have much time left. [[16 旁白 neutral]]
Just when Lv Yang had lost all hope, thinking he was about to die right after arriving. [[17 旁白 neutral]]
A small dot of light suddenly appeared before his eyes. It grew quickly, visibly changing into a screen! [[18 旁白 surprised]]
[Name: Lv Yang] [[19 旁白 neutral]]
[Lifespan: 18] [[20 旁白 neutral]]
[Cultivation: None] [[21 旁白 neutral]]
[Talent: None] [[22 旁白 neutral]]
[Technique: None] [[23 旁白 neutral]]
[Abilities: None] [[24 旁白 neutral]]
[Treasures: None] [[25 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, Lv Yang looked at the system screen and almost wanted to cry. Hadn't he heard that heaven never closes all doors? As long as he wanted to go on, there would be a way! [[26 旁白 happy]]
System, give me some points! [[27 吕阳 happy]]
Then, Lv Yang was stunned. [[28 旁白 neutral]]
He searched left and right, up and down, but couldn't find the plus sign he was hoping for in the skills section. There wasn't even a minus sign. [[29 旁白 sad]]
"Hey, System, where are my points?" [[30 吕阳 confused]]
After searching for a long time, Lv Yang had to accept a desperate fact: his personal panel didn't seem to have a point-adding function. [[31 旁白 sad]]
In other words, he had to rely on his own efforts to improve. [[32 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang: "..." [[33 旁白 neutral]]
Damn it, you wanted me to work hard before I got a system. Now that I have one, you still want me to work hard? Then what was the point of getting a system? [[34 吕阳 angry]]
System, fuck your— [[35 吕阳 angry]]
[Current pages remaining in The Hundred Lives Book: 100] [[36 旁白 neutral]]
[The Hundred Lives Book: After death, you can return to the initial time point and start a new life.] [[37 旁白 neutral]]
[After restarting, you can choose to inherit one of the following from your previous life: treasures, cultivation, or lifespan. Alternatively, you can give up all gains from your past life to awaken a new talent.] [[38 旁白 neutral]]
Dad, I'm fine now. [[39 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang suddenly became excited. A hundred lives of reincarnation, what a huge fortune! If he could use it well, it could help him soar to the sky! [[40 旁白 happy]]
"Those whose names are called, come before me." [[41 黑衣道人 neutral]]
Just then, a black-robed Daoist with a grim expression appeared before them. He held a register in his hands, and a candlestick floated beside him. [[42 旁白 neutral]]
"Drop your blood into the life lamp next to me to ignite your life flame. From now on, you are in-name disciples of my Chu Sheng Sect." [[43 黑衣道人 neutral]]
Hearing this, no one present looked happy. [[44 旁白 fearful]]
Most of the people sent here had heard of the Chu Sheng Sect's terrible reputation and knew that being a so-called in-name disciple was more of a curse than a blessing. [[45 旁白 fearful]]
But the black-robed Daoist ignored their thoughts and simply called out the names one by one. [[46 旁白 neutral]]
"Chen Liang." [[47 黑衣道人 neutral]]
"Here!" [[48 陈良 happy]]
The black-robed Daoist called a name, and a young boy with red lips and white teeth next to Lv Yang stood up and skipped over to the Daoist. [[49 旁白 neutral]]
The boy was very handsome, with bright, expressive eyes. Most importantly, he had a spiritual energy about him that even a mortal could see. From his expression and posture, he was clearly intelligent and mature for his age. In the mortal world, he would have been a prized student that all the academies would fight over. [[50 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, the black-robed Daoist's face lit up with surprise. [[51 旁白 surprised]]
"What a gifted child!" [[52 黑衣道人 happy]]
"You praise me too much, Daoist brother." The young boy bowed respectfully, his childish voice making people naturally like him. [[53 陈良 happy]]
The black-robed Daoist's smile grew wider. [[54 黑衣道人 happy]]
"Excellent, excellent. The Chu Sheng Sect needs talented people like you!" [[55 黑衣道人 happy]]
As he spoke, the black-robed Daoist took his brush and lightly crossed out Chen Liang's name in the register. [[56 旁白 neutral]]
Thud! [[57 旁白 surprised]]
The next second, without any warning, the spirited young boy's eyes rolled back, and he fell to the ground, silent. [[58 旁白 surprised]]
After doing this, the black-robed Daoist casually ordered: [[59 旁白 neutral]]
"Send the blood and skin to the Pill Refining Hall, the bones and soul to the Treasure Refining Hall, and the organs to the Beast Taming Hall. Don't let such an outstanding talent go to waste." [[60 黑衣道人 neutral]]
His words left the other in-name disciples speechless. [[61 旁白 fearful]]
The black-robed Daoist chuckled darkly. "Junior Brothers, don't misunderstand." [[62 黑衣道人 neutral]]
"The sect has always valued 'worth.' Therefore, a disciple's excellence is measured only by whether he can create enough value for the sect." [[63 黑衣道人 neutral]]
"That Junior Brother just now was a gifted child with a strong body. He could only create the greatest value for the sect after death, which is why he died." [[64 黑衣道人 neutral]]
"As for you, Junior Brothers, your talents are ordinary. You can create value for the sect while you are alive, so you don't have to worry about this." [[65 黑衣道人 neutral]]
"Next." [[66 黑衣道人 neutral]]
The black-robed Daoist continued to call names. The people below were terrified, but they had to obey, afraid of suffering the same fate as the young boy. [[67 旁白 fearful]]
"Lv Yang." [[68 黑衣道人 neutral]]
"Here." [[69 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang stepped forward with a respectful expression. [[70 旁白 neutral]]
The black-robed Daoist's eyes first landed on Lv Yang's handsome face with a hint of pleasure, but then he examined his physique. [[71 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, however, he shook his head in disappointment. [[72 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, in his eyes, Lv Yang was useless except for his good looks. [[73 旁白 neutral]]
"Go to the Joyful Union Hall." [[74 黑衣道人 neutral]]
Lv Yang didn't dare to ask questions and quickly replied, "Yes." [[75 吕阳 neutral]]
After the assignments, Lv Yang received a nearly transparent jade token with his name carved on it. A flame seemed to be sealed inside. [[76 旁白 neutral]]
He also received a technique manual. [[77 旁白 neutral]]
The manual was called the "Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra," the technique of the Joyful Union Hall where he was assigned. It was said to allow one to cultivate true qi and enter the Qi Refining realm. [[78 旁白 neutral]]
The old servant leading the way said casually, "The flame inside the life token is your life flame. Remember to carry it with you at all times. The sect's formations, spiritual plants, and spiritual beasts recognize tokens, not people. If you forget to bring it one day and die in the sect, don't blame me for not telling you." [[79 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the group was led to a hall. [[80 旁白 neutral]]
In front of the hall stood a beautiful, curvaceous woman in a long dress with a slit up to her thigh. Her every glance was full of charm. [[81 旁白 neutral]]
Gulp. [[82 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang clearly heard someone next to him swallow hard. [[83 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing everyone looking at her, the beautiful woman was not shy. Instead, she giggled, covering her mouth, and lifted the side of her skirt with one hand. [[84 旁白 neutral]]
Under the skirt, a jade token dangled, swinging in front of a soft, white area. [[85 旁白 neutral]]
The name on the token read: Yu Suzhen. [[86 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the Joyful Union Hall. I am Yu Suzhen, and I suppose I am your Senior Sister." [[87 玉素真 neutral]]
The next moment, Lv Yang noticed the beautiful woman's eyes light up as her gaze fell on him, direct and undisguised. [[88 旁白 neutral]]
"This Junior Brother is so handsome. He must be a disciple of our Joyful Union Hall." [[89 玉素真 happy]]
Yu Suzhen chuckled, then twisted her slender waist, her skirt swaying as she walked step by step towards Lv Yang. The sight of her made him dizzy. [[90 旁白 neutral]]
"I think you look quite good. Come with me, and I'll tell you about the Joyful Union Hall." [[91 玉素真 neutral]]
Lv Yang quickly cupped his hands. "Thank you, Senior Sister Yu." [[92 吕阳 neutral]]
"Why be so polite?" [[93 玉素真 happy]]
Yu Suzhen gave Lv Yang a charming glance, then turned and swayed her hips as she walked away, arousing the passion of the surrounding men. [[94 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang, however, did not dare to look too much and quietly followed. [[95 旁白 neutral]]
"Our sect's disciples are divided into inner and outer. The Four Outer Halls—Treasure Refining, Pill Refining, Beast Taming, and Joyful Union—are where you in-name disciples go." [[96 玉素真 neutral]]
"Only by passing the trials of the Four Outer Halls can you enter the inner peaks, receive true teachings, and become a formal disciple." [[97 玉素真 neutral]]
"You are lucky to have entered my Joyful Union Hall. You won't have to suffer like the other three halls, as our trial is much easier." [[98 玉素真 neutral]]
At this point, Yu Suzhen suddenly leaned close to Lv Yang. [[99 旁白 neutral]]
"Do you want to know what it is?" [[100 玉素真 neutral]]
The next moment, Lv Yang felt a breath of hot air on his ear, and a sweet fragrance filled his nose. When he turned to look, an exquisite, pretty face was right in front of him. [[101 旁白 neutral]]
"Please enlighten me, Senior Sister." Lv Yang said, looking up. [[102 吕阳 neutral]]
"That would be dual cultivation." [[103 玉素真 neutral]]
The delicate voice whispered in his ear like a lover's murmur. Before she finished speaking, a slender hand was already on Lv Yang's head. [[104 旁白 neutral]]
A gentle grasp. [[105 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang gasped. [[106 旁白 surprised]]
