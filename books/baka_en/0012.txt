Chapter 12: Merit Lottery and the Death-Substitute Puppet [[947 旁白 neutral]]
"The Rainbow Merit Fish, a one-billion-point grand prize." [[948 旁白 surprised]]
Because related news was already flying everywhere and everyone was discussing it, Lv Yang easily figured out the whole story. [[949 旁白 neutral]]
It turned out there was a permanent special task in the Chu Sheng Sect called "Accumulating Merit." [[950 旁白 neutral]]
The location was a blessed place called the "Merit Pool," deep within the Sea of Clouds below the Sacred Fire Cliff. In the pool lived a special spirit beast known as the "Merit Fish." [[951 旁白 neutral]]
The fish came in five colors: white, blue, purple, gold, and rainbow. [[952 旁白 neutral]]
The closer to rainbow, the richer the Merit Fish's essence. Consuming it would not only improve the quality of one's True Qi but could even help break through cultivation bottlenecks. [[953 旁白 neutral]]
This was how the "Accumulating Merit" task came to be. [[954 旁白 neutral]]
Each person could accept this task once a month. You would first blindly pick a number, then pay 10 Contribution Points to receive the Merit Fish corresponding to that number. [[955 旁白 neutral]]
However, the 10 Contribution Points paid by cultivators were not collected by the sect. Instead, they were added to the Merit Pool's account. A high-ranking sect official had made a special announcement: anyone who managed to pick the only Rainbow Merit Fish would win all the Contribution Points in the pool! [[956 旁白 neutral]]
Nearly a hundred years had passed since the task was first created. [[957 旁白 neutral]]
But in a hundred years, no one had ever picked the Rainbow Merit Fish. As a result, the Contribution Points in the pool kept growing until it reached an astronomical number. [[958 旁白 neutral]]
"One billion! One billion!" [[959 藏书阁老人 angry]]
On his rocking chair, the old man was still muttering, his voice filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred. [[960 旁白 neutral]]
Just yesterday, the grand prize of this "Merit Lottery" was finally won. The disciple who won it had joined the sect less than ten days ago. [[961 旁白 neutral]]
A prize pool built over a hundred years was claimed by a newcomer of less than ten days! [[962 旁白 surprised]]
No wonder the old man from the Library Pavilion felt it was unfair. After all, a portion of the one-billion-point prize came from his own contributions over the years. [[963 旁白 neutral]]
What's more, that disciple, Xiao Shiye, not only won the one-billion-point prize but also received the precious Rainbow Merit Fish. After consuming it, he broke through from the first level of Qi Refining to the peak of Qi Refining overnight. He had already been accepted as a disciple by a sect Elder and was now in seclusion, preparing to reach the Foundation Establishment realm. [[964 旁白 neutral]]
Even Lv Yang couldn't help but feel a hint of envy at such a turn of fortune. [[965 旁白 neutral]]
But his expression quickly changed. The lucky winner, Xiao Shiye, had not hidden the number he picked to win the Rainbow Merit Fish. [[966 旁白 neutral]]
"2025113" [[967 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the number, Lv Yang couldn't help but gulp. [[968 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Lv Yang committed the number to memory, planning to use it in his next life, an elegant figure suddenly appeared outside the Library Pavilion. [[969 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv?" [[970 清尘仙子 surprised]]
Lv Yang looked up and immediately recognized her. It was Fairy Qingchen. She seemed surprised too, a hint of pleasure at the unexpected meeting on her pretty face. [[971 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, it's Qingchen. Is it time?" [[972 藏书阁老人 neutral]]
The old man from the Library Pavilion also saw Fairy Qingchen. His bored expression instantly turned serious as he stood up and said, "Then let's leave at once." [[973 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother, you're also going to explore the immortal's abode?" Lv Yang asked curiously. [[974 吕阳 neutral]]
"What else?" the old man said irritably. "I just lost a lot of money. If I don't find some side work, I'll have nothing to eat!" [[975 藏书阁老人 angry]]
"Lost a lot of money?" [[976 吕阳 surprised]]
"Sigh, it was a moment of carelessness," the old man sighed. "Some time ago, the Sect had a great battle with the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion from Jiangnan." [[977 藏书阁老人 sad]]
"The Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion came prepared. They managed to steal one of the Sect's Mass Corpse Pits in the south." [[978 旁白 neutral]]
"The 'Death-Substituting Yin Skeletons' produced in that pit are very precious treasures. Once the pit was taken, their price in the Sect shot up." [[979 旁白 neutral]]
"At first, everyone was hoarding them. I was cautious and just watched for a while." [[980 旁白 neutral]]
"Later, I saw the price was only going up, and I felt the opportunity was slipping away, so I bought a batch at a high price from someone else." [[981 旁白 neutral]]
At this point, the old man from the Library Pavilion was full of regret, slapping his thigh. "Who would have thought, right after I stocked up, news came that the Sect launched a counterattack and retook the Mass Corpse Pit. The price, which had just risen, instantly plummeted to less than its original value!" [[982 藏书阁老人 angry]]
Lv Yang was speechless. [[983 吕阳 neutral]]
"But thankfully, there's Qingchen." The old man sighed for a moment, then cheered up again, saying, "Qingchen is such a good person." [[984 藏书阁老人 happy]]
Fairy Qingchen smiled shyly, "Senior Brother, you praise me too much." [[985 清尘仙子 happy]]
"It's from the bottom of my heart," the old man said sincerely. "If you hadn't recommended Senior Brother Zhao to me, I'm afraid I wouldn't have even gotten my investment back." [[986 藏书阁老人 happy]]
"It was just a small effort," Fairy Qingchen said humbly. "It just so happened that Senior Brother Zhao needed a batch of Death-Substituting Yin Skeletons, and you had some in stock. I was just in the right place at the right time. I only hope that when we explore the immortal's abode, you can help me if I find something I like." [[987 清尘仙子 neutral]]
Senior Brother Zhao... Zhao Xuhe? Lv Yang's heart skipped a beat. [[988 吕阳 surprised]]
"By the way, Junior Brother Lv." [[989 清尘仙子 neutral]]
Only then did Fairy Qingchen seem to remember Lv Yang, turning to look at him. "About this exploration of the immortal's abode, are you really not planning to come with us?" [[990 清尘仙子 neutral]]
"...I'm sorry to disappoint you, Senior Sister." [[991 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang shook his head. "I'm new to the sect and not very strong. I just want to focus on my cultivation. Exploring the abode is too dangerous, and I don't have the strength for it." [[992 吕阳 sad]]
"Kid, I don't like hearing that." [[993 藏书阁老人 angry]]
The old man from the Library Pavilion shook his head. "Focus on cultivation? For ordinary disciples like us with no money or power, there's no future in just quietly cultivating." [[994 藏书阁老人 angry]]
"Cultivation itself is an act of defying heaven. Without taking risks, how can your cultivation improve rapidly?" [[995 藏书阁老人 angry]]
"When everyone else is scared and wants to retreat, that's when you should be brave enough to try and seize the opportunity!" [[996 藏书阁老人 angry]]
'Be greedy when others are fearful.' No wonder you went bankrupt. [[997 吕阳 neutral]]
No matter how persuasively the old man from the Library Pavilion spoke, Lv Yang politely refused, which angered the man so much that he left, muttering, "Useless wood cannot be carved." [[998 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Fairy Qingchen didn't press the matter further. She gave Lv Yang a deep look, then turned and left with the old man. They went to a hidden cave on Sky Mending Peak. She had the old man wait in the outer court, then walked into the inner court and stood before a quiet room. [[999 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the door to the quiet room opened, and Zhao Xuhe walked out. [[1000 旁白 neutral]]
"Failed again? He still didn't agree?" [[1001 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe's brows furrowed as he listened to Fairy Qingchen's report. "He really is determined in his Dao path. Well, it doesn't matter much if he's not there." [[1002 赵旭河 angry]]
"Senior Brother, I think there's something wrong with him." [[1003 清尘仙子 fearful]]
Fairy Qingchen bit her lip. "The life lamps of my three lovers have gone out. I sent them to kill that guy last night... It seems they failed." [[1004 清尘仙子 fearful]]
"Senior Brother, you know my three lovers were all at the third level of Qi Refining. For Lv Yang to kill them... could he already be at the middle stage of cultivation?" [[1005 清尘仙子 fearful]]
"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!" [[1006 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe shook his head without hesitation. "Breaking through a bottleneck is not so easy. In just a few days, the most he could have reached is the third level of Qi Refining. It's impossible for him to have reached the middle stage." [[1007 赵旭河 angry]]
"You don't need to be so suspicious. I've checked his purchase history." [[1008 赵旭河 neutral]]
"He bought so many Qi Pills. If he took them without caring about the cost, reaching the third level of Qi Refining wouldn't be surprising. As for your three lovers..." [[1009 赵旭河 neutral]]
"He took out a cultivation loan to buy a divine skill, the Divine Firmament Sword Control Art from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion." Zhao Xuhe analyzed the situation carefully. "If he has a special talent for the sword and can master the technique quickly, it wouldn't be surprising if he could kill your three lovers." [[1010 赵旭河 neutral]]
"That... Senior Brother is right." [[1011 清尘仙子 neutral]]
Fairy Qingchen thought for a moment and felt that Zhao Xuhe's analysis was more reasonable. After all, she knew from experience how difficult the middle-stage bottleneck was. [[1012 旁白 neutral]]
It had taken her nearly ten years to barely break through. [[1013 旁白 neutral]]
To say that a new disciple broke through in less than a month was completely unbelievable, unless he was a reincarnated Elder. [[1014 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, we'll talk about this later." [[1015 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe waved his hand, his eyes glinting coldly. "First, let's handle the 'immortal's abode' matter. Have you gathered everyone?" [[1016 赵旭河 neutral]]
"They're all here," Fairy Qingchen nodded. "Especially Wang Bairong from the Library Pavilion. Since you bought his Death-Substituting Yin Skeletons, he trusts us a lot now." [[1017 清尘仙子 neutral]]
"Good." [[1018 赵旭河 happy]]
Zhao Xuhe smiled coldly. "Our sect has always been full of talented people. Whether I can make a fortune this time depends entirely on these junior and senior brothers of mine..." [[1019 赵旭河 happy]]
