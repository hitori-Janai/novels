Chapter 34: The Three Rivers Guild's Recruitment and a Foundation Establishment Opportunity [[2660 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the cave residence, following Lv Yang's breakthrough, information about him was placed on the desks of interested parties. His origins and background were quickly investigated. [[2661 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Lv Yang had predicted, his background could be described in four words. [[2662 旁白 neutral]]
Perfectly dark origins. [[2663 旁白 neutral]]
He joined the sect through the annual recruitment, formally entered the Joyful Union Hall, made a fortune selling Death-Substitute Yin Puppets, and then went into seclusion. [[2664 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a true ascetic." [[2665 飞霞 surprised]]
Looking at the report, a female cultivator with a beautiful yet deadly face and sharp eyes couldn't help but praise him. She was also a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator. However, unlike Lv Yang who had just broken through, she was already at the ninth level, just one step away from completion. [[2666 旁白 neutral]]
The female cultivator's name was Feixia, and she was well-known in the sect. [[2667 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't just because of her beauty, but because she was a rare Talisman Cultivator. Her skills had even earned the respect of a sect elder. [[2668 旁白 neutral]]
"Being an ascetic alone isn't enough to reach the late stage of Qi Refining." [[2669 青年 neutral]]
Beside Fairy Feixia, a young man with a feather fan smiled slightly, "He made a fortune from the Death-Substitute Yin Puppets, yet he kept a low profile." [[2670 青年 neutral]]
"This shows he is a cautious and clever person." [[2671 青年 neutral]]
"That's normal. It makes sense." [[2672 飞霞 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia sighed. "For ordinary disciples like us to get ahead, talent, caution, intelligence, and courage are all essential." [[2673 飞霞 sad]]
"So, is it decided?" [[2674 青年 neutral]]
Feixia nodded. "I will recommend him. He broke through to the late Qi Refining stage in just ten years. Our Three Rivers Guild needs someone like him." [[2675 飞霞 neutral]]
Inside his cave residence, Lv Yang sat on a meditation cushion. [[2676 旁白 neutral]]
In front of him were more than ten message talismans. Each was an offer from a faction, promising great rewards if he joined them. The rewards included cultivation partners, techniques, artifacts, and pills—anything he could want. [[2677 旁白 neutral]]
"I didn't realize in my past life that there were so many factions in the sect..." [[2678 吕阳 surprised]]
Basically, any cultivator who reached the late stage of Qi Refining could form a sizable group, just like Liu Xin did in a previous life. [[2679 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang wasn't surprised by this. [[2680 旁白 neutral]]
After all, it was strange for a sect to have no factions. The Chu Sheng Sect was huge, so it was impossible for everyone to be united. People would naturally form groups for their own benefit. [[2681 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, most of these factions were small and had no real foundation. [[2682 旁白 neutral]]
The ones with real power to recruit him were the factions established by sect elders or true disciples. Their offers were also more credible. [[2683 旁白 neutral]]
But that was all. [[2684 旁白 neutral]]
"I still overestimated myself." Lv Yang shook his head. The offers from the major factions were indeed good, often involving tens of thousands of contribution points. [[2685 吕阳 sad]]
However, he didn't need money. [[2686 旁白 neutral]]
He still hadn't spent all the contribution points he earned from the Death-Substitute Yin Puppets. [[2687 旁白 neutral]]
More than money, he needed "access"—the kind of access that would let him reach the middle-level of the sect and buy things that were normally unavailable. [[2688 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Lv Yang was thinking, the array outside his door suddenly activated. [[2689 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked up and saw the illumination array he had set up flare brightly, revealing the elegant silhouette of a woman. [[2690 旁白 neutral]]
It was Fairy Feixia. [[2691 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Lv, you also know array formations?" Fairy Feixia looked at the glowing array patterns around them, a pleasant surprise on her face. [[2692 飞霞 surprised]]
Lv Yang bowed. "Senior Sister, may I ask why you are here?" [[2693 吕阳 neutral]]
Fairy Feixia didn't act coy and returned the gesture gracefully. "I am Feixia, a deacon of the Three Rivers Guild. I have come for you, Junior Brother." [[2694 飞霞 neutral]]
"Oh? Please come in, Senior Sister." [[2695 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang quickly welcomed her, his mind racing. The Three Rivers Guild? Wasn't that Zhao Xuhe's faction? Why would they come to recruit him? [[2696 旁白 surprised]]
Lv Yang didn't know much about the Three Rivers Guild, but he knew Zhao Xuhe was a member. More importantly, as a disciple of the Sky Mending Peak's master, Zhao Xuhe was only a low-to-mid-ranking member. This alone showed the guild's high standards. [[2697 旁白 neutral]]
"Please forgive my ignorance, Senior Sister, but what is the Three Rivers Guild?" [[2698 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang asked cautiously. Feixia was not surprised and smiled. "The Three Rivers Guild was established by three true disciple senior brothers." [[2699 飞霞 neutral]]
"The eldest of them is already a Foundation Establishment cultivator and has his own peak in the sea of clouds." [[2700 飞霞 neutral]]
"Although the second and third brothers haven't reached Foundation Establishment yet, they have both cultivated third-grade true qi and are at the peak of Qi Refining. They could break through at any moment." [[2701 飞霞 neutral]]
"I heard that you also come from an ordinary background, Junior Brother. You should know how difficult life is for ordinary disciples. The three senior brothers came from humble beginnings like us, so after they became powerful, they established the Three Rivers Guild to help ordinary disciples through the early stages." [[2702 飞霞 neutral]]
"I see." Lv Yang looked respectful. "The three senior brothers are truly virtuous." [[2703 吕阳 neutral]]
What a joke! [[2704 吕阳 angry]]
If I hadn't taken a loan from your Three Rivers Guild in a past life and seen your 36% annual interest rate with my own eyes, I might have believed that nonsense. [[2705 旁白 angry]]
Lv Yang scoffed internally. He was never one to act without seeing a reward, so he wouldn't make a rash decision based on Feixia's words. He asked cautiously, "It is an honor to be invited. I just wonder what the benefits of joining are?" [[2706 吕阳 neutral]]
"You don't have to worry about that, Junior Brother." [[2707 飞霞 neutral]]
Feixia replied frankly, "If you are willing to join, I can immediately offer you a true disciple-level secret technique." [[2708 飞霞 neutral]]
"After joining, you will receive an annual stipend of contribution points." [[2709 飞霞 neutral]]
"And as long as you have the money, you can use the guild's true disciple-level access to buy items you want or even ask the three senior brothers for guidance." [[2710 飞霞 neutral]]
"Of course, there are also requirements." [[2711 飞霞 neutral]]
At this point, Feixia took out a jade slip and placed it before Lv Yang. "All who join must sign a contract and leave a drop of their blood essence." [[2712 飞霞 neutral]]
"That's simple." [[2713 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang glanced at the contract. It contained the usual clauses for a faction, such as confidentiality. Some might feel they would lose their freedom, but Lv Yang didn't care at all. He signed his name with a wave of his hand. [[2714 旁白 neutral]]
It's just for one lifetime. It won't affect the next one. [[2715 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, Lv Yang wished the contract was even more binding. That would make it more likely for him to be treated as an insider and receive better resources. [[2716 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Lv Yang act so decisively, Fairy Feixia nodded with satisfaction. [[2717 飞霞 happy]]
"Next, just take out your disciple token, and I will place a restriction on it. From now on, the token can be used within the guild." [[2718 飞霞 neutral]]
"Thank you for your trouble, Senior Sister." [[2719 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang took out his token. Feixia formed a hand seal and sent a talismanic seal into it. A new section immediately appeared on the token. [[2720 旁白 neutral]]
"The art of talisman making..." [[2721 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang's eyes lit up. He was now a ninth-grade array master. Though he didn't understand talismans, he could grasp some of the principles. [[2722 旁白 neutral]]
To him, a talisman was like a simple, temporary, small-scale array. [[2723 旁白 neutral]]
This is good stuff. I want to learn it. [[2724 吕阳 happy]]
The next moment, seeing this display of talisman art, Lv Yang finally remembered who Fairy Feixia was. He had heard of her in a previous life. [[2725 旁白 surprised]]
"She is Zhao Xuhe's cultivation partner." Lv Yang thought to himself. "In a past life, while I was studying arrays, I heard she and Zhao Xuhe became partners. They were both at the peak of Qi Refining and shone on the battlefield between the righteous and demonic sects. They even attempted to reach Foundation Establishment together, but unfortunately, they failed and both died." [[2726 吕阳 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang's eyes suddenly lit up. [[2727 旁白 surprised]]
The key point wasn't their failure and death. It was that they had the chance to attempt Foundation Establishment in the first place. That meant there had to be an opportunity for Foundation Establishment involved! [[2728 旁白 surprised]]
