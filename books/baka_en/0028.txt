Chapter 28: Nine Transformations Dragon Art [[2207 旁白 neutral]]
[You were determined to forge the formation treasure, unmoved even as your life was ending. You finally succeeded, but you passed away in the process.] [[2208 旁白 neutral]]
[Current remaining pages of the Hundred Lives Book: 96] [[2209 旁白 neutral]]
[Starting a new life, you can choose one of the following rewards from your previous life:] [[2210 旁白 neutral]]
[One: Treasures.] [[2211 旁白 neutral]]
[Two: Cultivation.] [[2212 旁白 neutral]]
[Three: Lifespan.] [[2213 旁白 neutral]]
[Four: Give up all rewards and awaken a random talent based on your past experience.] [[2214 旁白 neutral]]
"Those whose names are called, come before me." [[2215 刘信 neutral]]
Lv Yang opened his eyes. After a long moment, he let out a deep breath, waking from the dream of his past and present lives. "I choose the treasure." [[2216 吕阳 neutral]]
The next second, there was a movement in his Dantian. [[2217 旁白 neutral]]
A scarlet sword pill, covered in complex formation patterns and as brilliant as the stars, appeared in his Dantian, letting out a clear sword cry. [[2218 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked satisfied. This sword pill was the fruit of more than twenty years of hard work in his previous life. Not only were the materials top-quality, but it was also enhanced by the Sky Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light. More importantly, he had successfully embedded a superior formation into the sword pill before he died, turning it into a formation treasure. [[2219 旁白 happy]]
This way, when Lv Yang fought with others, he could pull his enemies into the formation diagram. [[2220 旁白 neutral]]
The advantage of this was obvious. After all, no matter how powerful a cultivator was, it was impossible to single-handedly fight against a formation set up by a cultivator of the same realm. [[2221 旁白 neutral]]
The reason Fairy Qingchen was not strong was that she was only at the middle stage of Qi Refining. [[2222 旁白 neutral]]
And from Lv Yang's current perspective, she hadn't studied formations for long enough, certainly not as long as his own twenty years of hard study. [[2223 旁白 neutral]]
"It's time to give you a name." [[2224 吕阳 neutral]]
With a thought from Lv Yang, a chilling blood shadow with his exact appearance emerged from the sword pill. The two were of one mind, and it let out a soft chuckle. [[2225 旁白 neutral]]
"You were forged from the sacrifice of my previous life and enhanced by the Blood-Transforming Divine Light. From now on, your name will be Blood Sun." [[2226 吕阳 neutral]]
The sword pill buzzed as if in agreement. [[2227 旁白 neutral]]
Putting aside his distracting thoughts, Lv Yang glanced at Liu Xin, who was still talking on the stage, then looked away. There was no rush for the Innate True Qi Myriad Souls Banner. [[2228 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Lv Yang began to act, following the same path as his previous life. [[2229 旁白 neutral]]
Go on stage, get assigned, Joyful Union Hall. [[2230 旁白 neutral]]
Outlive Yu Suzhen. [[2231 旁白 neutral]]
Instead of borrowing from Zhao Xuhe, he directly sold the White Bone Flying Sword and other benefits given to new disciples, then began to quietly purchase Yin Death-Substitution Puppets. [[2232 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the price of Yin Death-Substitution Puppets skyrocketed. [[2233 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang secretly fueled the trend, buying low and selling high, constantly expanding his capital, and then hoarding more. [[2234 旁白 neutral]]
However, to avoid making others jealous, he chose not to sell at the highest point like in his past life, but exited the market when the price reached 3,000 points. [[2235 旁白 neutral]]
By then, he had accumulated a total of 20 Yin Death-Substitution Puppets. [[2236 旁白 neutral]]
A massive profit of 60,000 contribution points. [[2237 旁白 happy]]
After all this, Lv Yang bought a large number of spirit pills, sealed his cave residence, and took out the greatest reward from his four reincarnations. [[2238 旁白 neutral]]
"Nine Transformations Dragon Art". [[2239 旁白 neutral]]
"Myriad Vehicles Dragon-Riding Ascension Treasure Scroll". [[2240 旁白 neutral]]
The former was for Qi Refining, the latter for Foundation Establishment. Together, they formed a cultivation method that could cultivate third-grade True Qi and lead directly to the Golden Core path, perfectly matching Lv Yang's expectations. [[2241 旁白 happy]]
"The Nine Transformations Dragon Art has ten layers, corresponding to the ten layers of Qi Refining. As the name suggests, each layer can trigger a transformation of True Qi, including Heavenly Snake, Divine Eagle, Green Ox, and Brocade Tiger... After nine transformations, it becomes a dragon, increasing the chance of breaking through to Foundation Establishment by thirty percent." [[2242 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang was captivated and immediately decided to dissipate his cultivation to practice it. [[2243 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang!" [[2244 旁白 neutral]]
As the True Qi in his Dantian rapidly dissipated, Lv Yang's realm also began to fall quickly. In a short while, he went from the fourth layer of Qi Refining back to being a mortal. [[2245 旁白 neutral]]
However, he didn't waste the dispersed True Qi, instead feeding it all to his "Innate True Qi". [[2246 旁白 neutral]]
This external Qi, refined from the sacrifice of his second life, was now nourished by the cultivation of his current life, becoming like an avatar to him. [[2247 旁白 neutral]]
With it protecting him during his seclusion, he wouldn't be completely defenseless. [[2248 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, three years passed. [[2249 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the cave residence, Lv Yang sat on a cushion, circulating the profound technique. His Dantian, once empty after dissipating his cultivation, was now occupied by an even more formidable True Qi. [[2250 旁白 neutral]]
His Qi moved with his will, changing and transforming. One moment it was a nimble rabbit leaping through his meridians, the next a python hibernating in his Dantian, then a colorful tiger roaring at the sky, and then a graceful eagle soaring freely. The variations were endless. [[2251 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, Lv Yang let out a deep breath. [[2252 旁白 neutral]]
The breath was like a white arrow. It did not disperse after leaving his body, but instead transformed into a sturdy green ox, walking slowly as if carrying a majestic mountain. [[2253 旁白 neutral]]
"Success!" [[2254 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang's face lit up with joy. His cultivation in these three years had been much smoother than in his previous three lives. After all, he had plenty of contribution points and no shortage of external medicines. [[2255 旁白 happy]]
Therefore, in just three years, he had returned to the sixth layer of Qi Refining, the peak of the middle stage. [[2256 旁白 happy]]
Although he was stuck at the middle-stage bottleneck, Lv Yang was confident that in three to five years, he would break through again and return to the late stage of Qi Refining! [[2257 旁白 happy]]
And even though he was still at the sixth layer of Qi Refining, his combat power was likely not much different from his previous life, because his True Qi in this life was on a completely different level. [[2258 旁白 neutral]]
"Nine Transformations into a Dragon, each transformation has a corresponding magical art. The Brocade Tiger transformation increases True Qi's destructive power, the Green Ox transformation enhances physical strength, the Divine Eagle transformation grants clairvoyance, the Heavenly Snake transformation can conceal one's aura, the Jade Rabbit transformation increases speed, and the Mountain Camel transformation increases True Qi recovery speed..." [[2259 旁白 neutral]]
The six transformations almost closed the gap between the middle and late stages of Qi Refining! [[2260 旁白 happy]]
But what excited Lv Yang the most was the "Flying Fish Transformation" among the nine transformations, because its effect was simple: breaking through bottlenecks! [[2261 旁白 excited]]
"If I cultivate the sixth transformation now, I could probably break through to the late stage in an instant." [[2262 吕阳 thoughtful]]
"But that would be too much of a waste." [[2263 吕阳 thoughtful]]
Lv Yang was ambitious and would not use this precious breakthrough opportunity on the late stage of Qi Refining. He planned to use it when breaking through to the peak of Qi Refining. [[2264 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang's plan for this life was simple: cultivate. [[2265 旁白 neutral]]
"I will cultivate silently, and after reaching the peak of Qi Refining, I will seamlessly transition to the Myriad Vehicles Dragon-Riding Ascension Treasure Scroll. I will remain in seclusion until I reach the Foundation Establishment realm and amaze everyone!" [[2266 吕阳 determined]]
Thinking this, Lv Yang casually took a spirit pill and entered a state of cultivation again. [[2267 旁白 neutral]]
Then, just a few days later. [[2268 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom!" [[2269 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang was startled from his meditation by a tremor. He opened his eyes to find that his Innate True Qi avatar, which he had left on guard outside, had been dispersed. [[2270 旁白 surprised]]
A powerful enemy has invaded? [[2271 旁白 surprised]]
Lv Yang was puzzled. In this life, he had stayed in his cave, cultivating and minding his own business. How could someone suddenly attack him? [[2272 旁白 neutral]]
Confused, Lv Yang walked out of his cave, only to see an unexpected acquaintance. [[2273 旁白 neutral]]
"It's you?" [[2274 赵旭河 angry]]
Outside the cave, Zhao Xuhe's eyes were bloodshot. He was accompanied by several cultivators with powerful auras, all glaring at Lv Yang with rage. [[2275 旁白 angry]]
"Senior Brother." Lv Yang cupped his hands. "I am Lv Yang, I don't know..." [[2276 吕阳 neutral]]
"It really is you!" [[2277 赵旭河 angry]]
Zhao Xuhe interrupted Lv Yang, saying hatefully, "Coiling Dragon Island has mysteriously disappeared. The opportunity I earned through three lifetimes of merit is suddenly gone. It cost me a great deal to ask my master to divine the cause, and he told me that the opportunity was taken by a disciple of the Holy Sect with the surname Lv from this place!" [[2278 赵旭河 angry]]
"Speak! Is the inheritance of the Perfected Person Panlong in your hands!" [[2279 赵旭河 angry]]
"..." [[2280 吕阳 neutral]]
As Zhao Xuhe's words fell, Lv Yang was first stunned, then, as if he had realized something, his expression darkened visibly. [[2281 旁白 angry]]
