Chapter 27: Understanding Formations [[2127 旁白 neutral]]
As Lv Yang had predicted, Zhao Xuhe finally sold the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art" to him for the low price of 1500 contribution points. [[2128 旁白 neutral]]
People are always like that when they're in debt. [[2129 旁白 neutral]]
After obtaining the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art," Lv Yang immediately returned to his cave residence, memorized the technique word for word, and then put it away. [[2130 旁白 neutral]]
"It's a pity I can't cultivate now." [[2131 吕阳 sad]]
Transformed into a blood shadow, his cultivation level didn't change, permanently stuck in the late stage of Qi Refining. He couldn't even disperse his cultivation, so he could only wait for the next life. [[2132 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, Lv Yang was not in a hurry to kill himself. [[2133 旁白 neutral]]
After all, time was precious. Even with The Hundred Lives Book, he wouldn't waste it. Even if he couldn't cultivate, he could still make progress in other areas. [[2134 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lv Yang took out Fairy Qingchen's "Secret Manual of Array Treasures" from his storage bag. [[2135 旁白 neutral]]
That's right, he was going to learn formations! [[2136 旁白 neutral]]
Among the four arts of cultivation—formations, artifacts, pills, and talismans—mastering any one of them would make you a high-level talent in the cultivation world, welcome anywhere. [[2137 旁白 neutral]]
For example, Fairy Qingchen. Lv Yang thought she was truly talented. Not only did she know formations, but she could also integrate them into magic treasures. Unfortunately, she had poor taste in men, falling for scumbags who turned their backs on her, causing her to die with regret in both of her lives. [[2138 旁白 neutral]]
Opening the "Secret Manual of Array Treasures," the first page made Lv Yang sigh. [[2139 旁白 neutral]]
[The so-called array treasures use formations as treasures and treasures as formations. The two complement each other. The techniques within are the result of my own painstaking research.] [[2140 旁白 neutral]]
[To learn this path, both talent and hard work are essential. You cannot lack either.] [[2141 旁白 neutral]]
After the preface, the second page was filled with dense patterns. Each pattern had a note explaining its meaning. [[2142 旁白 neutral]]
[The art of formations is based on array patterns. By outlining these patterns, you can map the world and borrow its power. However, the world's secrets are endless and hard to understand, let alone turn into array patterns. This requires extraordinary insight. Only by mastering array patterns can you learn formations.] [[2143 旁白 neutral]]
[Very good. You now have a basic understanding of the principles of formations.] [[2144 旁白 neutral]]
[Next, turn to the third page. Let's look at a simple example below to apply what we've just learned.] [[2145 旁白 neutral]]
On the third page, an extremely complex and intricate diagram appeared before Lv Yang's eyes. [[2146 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a formation diagram?" [[2147 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang rubbed his chin. To solve a formation diagram, you had to identify its array patterns and figure out the formation's function. [[2148 旁白 neutral]]
Array patterns are the foundation of all formations. [[2149 旁白 neutral]]
Whether a formation works depends on if the patterns are combined correctly, without conflicts, forming a complete circuit. [[2150 旁白 neutral]]
"Interesting." [[2151 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang smiled confidently, thinking it didn't seem too hard. "With my talent and hard work, I am determined to master this simple formation diagram!" [[2152 吕阳 neutral]]
One month later. [[2153 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang sat blankly on his cushion, surrounded by piles of manuscripts filled with his calculations. He looked completely dejected. [[2154 旁白 neutral]]
In his hand was a series of combined array patterns. [[2155 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, a spiritual light suddenly glowed from Lv Yang's fingertip. [[2156 旁白 neutral]]
"It worked!?" [[2157 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang instantly stood up, overjoyed. He carefully looked at the array patterns he had assembled, made a quick calculation, and then looked confused. [[2158 旁白 neutral]]
"That's not right. How did it work?" [[2159 吕阳 surprised]]
"How is this thing even running?" [[2160 吕阳 surprised]]
It was the result of a month of his hard work, but he didn't understand why it worked. The feeling was driving him crazy. [[2161 旁白 neutral]]
After a month of hard study, he now had a deeper understanding of formations. [[2162 旁白 neutral]]
In short, formations were a lot like programming. [[2163 旁白 neutral]]
Understanding array paths was like digging through the terrible code written by heaven to find usable parts for your own code. [[2164 旁白 neutral]]
However, with formations, you either know it or you don't. [[2165 旁白 neutral]]
It was like searching for gold in a mountain of dirt. A person without talent, like the current Lv Yang, would only find a pile of dirt instead of any gold. [[2166 旁白 neutral]]
"No matter what, I managed to find something." [[2167 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang sighed and continued his research, forgetting to eat or sleep. Another month passed, and he finally solved the diagram in his hand. [[2168 旁白 neutral]]
"This is an illumination formation!" [[2169 吕阳 happy]]
"Within the range of the formation, it provides bright light, making most hiding techniques useless. It has no offensive or defensive power." [[2170 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked exhausted, his eyes bloodshot, but his face was full of excitement. With a great sense of accomplishment, he turned to the third page of the "Secret Manual of Array Treasures." [[2171 旁白 neutral]]
[It's normal if you can't solve it.] [[2172 旁白 neutral]]
[The main purpose of the problem on the third page is to make you understand how difficult formations are, so you approach them with humility and don't get ahead of yourself.] [[2173 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang: "..." [[2174 旁白 neutral]]
"You monster! You absolute monster!" [[2175 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang jumped up and threw the book on the ground. He was now one hundred percent sure that this formation manual was written by a formation master from the Chu Sheng Sect! [[2176 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, Lv Yang picked the book up again. [[2177 旁白 neutral]]
He had no choice. Some things you have to do to survive, whether you like them, understand them, or want to do them. [[2178 旁白 neutral]]
However, after studying further, Lv Yang realized his talent wasn't as bad as he thought. [[2179 旁白 neutral]]
As the book said, the complicated diagram on the third page was not meant for beginners, which was why he had been stuck on it for two months. [[2180 旁白 neutral]]
But there was an upside. Now, when he studied simpler, easier-to-understand formations, his learning speed was visibly faster. When he got stuck, he could figure it out after a few days of research. This helped him regain the confidence he had lost. [[2181 旁白 neutral]]
Time flew by in the cave, unnoticed. [[2182 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, twenty years had passed. [[2183 旁白 neutral]]
During this time, Lv Yang ignored the outside world and focused solely on studying formations. He didn't even bother to pay the rent for his cave residence and moved to the outer sect. [[2184 旁白 neutral]]
After all, he couldn't cultivate now, so he had no urgent needs and stopped working. [[2185 旁白 neutral]]
In those twenty years, every few years, a child of destiny with great luck, like Xiao Shiye, would suddenly rise in the outer sect. [[2186 旁白 neutral]]
However, after that child of destiny obtained a great opportunity known to everyone in the Chu Sheng Sect, they would suddenly disappear. [[2187 旁白 neutral]]
Along with them, a large group of unlucky people who had noticed the child's luck and tried to get close to them would also disappear. [[2188 旁白 neutral]]
"That senior is fishing again." [[2189 旁白 fearful]]
Every time he heard similar news, Lv Yang felt a wave of fear. With the example of Xiao Shiye, he would only stay far away from any child of destiny. [[2190 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't afford to provoke them, so he could only hide. [[2191 旁白 neutral]]
As for Zhao Xuhe, after twenty years, he had reached the peak of Qi Refining and become a famous true disciple of the sect. Unfortunately, he failed to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm a few years ago and died. [[2192 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang just sighed at this and didn't pay it any more mind. [[2193 旁白 neutral]]
What truly made Lv Yang happy was that after twenty years of hard study, he had finally mastered all the knowledge in the "Secret Manual of Array Treasures." [[2194 旁白 happy]]
Inside the cave residence, Lv Yang's entire focus was on the sword core in front of him. He was now so weak that he couldn't even maintain his human form, and his blood shadow was incredibly faint. [[2195 旁白 neutral]]
This was a sign that his end was near. [[2196 旁白 neutral]]
The side effects of cultivating the Heavenly Demon's Blood Shadow Transformation had finally caught up to him. He was only forty years old, but his life was already over. [[2197 旁白 neutral]]
However, Lv Yang didn't care about this at all. He continued to focus on inscribing the formation. Even as he was about to die, he didn't get up or try to do anything to save himself, because that would only interrupt his inspiration, and he didn't want to waste it. [[2198 旁白 neutral]]
"I understand! Wait... no, that's wrong." [[2199 吕阳 surprised]]
"Oh, it's right! It's right... no, wait, it's still not right... oh, it's right, it's right!" [[2200 吕阳 surprised]]
After a long time, just as Lv Yang's blood shadow was about to disappear, at the very moment between life and death, Lv Yang's eyes suddenly flew open— [[2201 旁白 neutral]]
"Hahaha! I succeeded!" [[2202 吕阳 happy]]
Watching the array patterns he had painstakingly drawn connect around the sword core and finally start working, Lv Yang burst out laughing, his laughter echoing in the cave. [[2203 旁白 happy]]
He lost his breath in the middle of his laughter. [[2204 旁白 sad]]
"The Hundred Lives Book!" [[2205 吕阳 happy]]
