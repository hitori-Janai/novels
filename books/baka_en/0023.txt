Chapter 23: The Innate Qi Myriad Spirit Banner [[1822 旁白 neutral]]
Above the sea of clouds, Liu Xin took the initiative to soften his stance: "If you two junior brothers are willing to make peace, I am willing to offer a high-quality Daoist scripture as a gift." [[1823 刘信 neutral]]
"At this point? You must be joking." [[1824 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang laughed when he heard this: "Senior Brother Liu, we are all disciples of the Chu Sheng Sect, so why pretend? You are already in a life-or-death situation with us." [[1825 吕阳 neutral]]
... [[1826 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin did not answer, his face just suddenly darkened. [[1827 旁白 neutral]]
Because Lv Yang was right. At this moment, the ones who truly didn't want to make peace were not Lv Yang and Xiao Shiye, but Liu Xin and Fairy Qingchen. [[1828 旁白 neutral]]
The reason was simple: the sect's rules. [[1829 旁白 neutral]]
"Although the sect's rules are meaningless as long as you're not caught, once you are discovered, the rules become very real." [[1830 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang sneered, "This is surely not the first time your group has ambushed and robbed fellow disciples. It's just that no one found out before. But now, if I report this to the Law Enforcement Hall after I leave, the truth will come out, and you, Senior Brother Liu, will almost certainly die." [[1831 吕阳 angry]]
"You must be joking, Junior Brother." [[1832 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin's face twitched slightly. "We can sign a magical contract, agreeing that today's events will not be spoken of. That way, I can naturally rest easy." [[1833 刘信 neutral]]
"Really?" Lv Yang asked back. [[1834 吕阳 surprised]]
Of course, it was a lie. [[1835 旁白 neutral]]
Only the dead can truly be trusted! [[1836 旁白 neutral]]
"Qingchen!" [[1837 刘信 angry]]
Following Liu Xin's low shout, Fairy Qingchen, who had been silent by his side, finally spoke. She parted her red lips and slowly said a single word: [[1838 旁白 neutral]]
"Open!" [[1839 清尘仙子 neutral]]
Before the word faded, the surrounding sea of clouds changed again. In an instant, huge mountain peaks appeared, trapping Lv Yang and Xiao Shiye in the center. [[1840 旁白 neutral]]
It was clearly another formation! [[1841 旁白 neutral]]
"Do you really think I'm afraid of your Heavenly Demon's Blood-Melting Divine Light?" Liu Xin sneered, surprisingly recognizing Lv Yang's special ability. A banner appeared in his hand, fluttering in the wind. "It just so happens that my 'Innate Qi Myriad Spirit Banner' is missing a main soul. Today, I'll use you to consecrate the banner." [[1842 刘信 angry]]
"Go!" [[1843 刘信 angry]]
Before Liu Xin could finish speaking, Lv Yang had already merged with his sword pellet and flew over to attack. The overwhelming smell of blood made Liu Xin swallow the rest of his taunt. [[1844 旁白 neutral]]
"Souls, return!" [[1845 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin formed a hand seal and shook the Myriad Spirit Banner forcefully. He released two wisps of white Qi that gradually formed into human shapes. [[1846 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang didn't stop and slashed down with his sword. [[1847 旁白 neutral]]
Driven by Liu Xin, the two figures channeled their True Qi and met the attack head-on. With a loud bang, both were shattered by the sword's energy. [[1848 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin had just been about to join the two banner spirits he had summoned, but seeing this, he quickly pulled back. [[1849 旁白 neutral]]
"Qingchen, attack now!" [[1850 刘信 fearful]]
Hearing this, Fairy Qingchen's pretty face turned serious. She took a phoenix-tail hairpin from her hair and threw it. The hairpin instantly turned into a golden light and shot towards the spot between Lv Yang's eyebrows. [[1851 旁白 neutral]]
However, before the hairpin could get close to Lv Yang, another flash of treasure light appeared and blocked it. It was Xiao Shiye, the boy of many treasures. [[1852 旁白 neutral]]
Not only that, Xiao Shiye then flicked his sleeve and threw out more than ten magical treasures at once. Although their quality varied, they all shone brightly. But after he threw them out, they exploded in mid-air! [[1853 旁白 neutral]]
BOOM! [[1854 旁白 neutral]]
The exploding light was like a series of small suns. It blocked the killing formation set up by Fairy Qingchen and almost blasted it apart from the inside! [[1855 旁白 neutral]]
This extravagant scene made the other three's eyes twitch. [[1856 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Shiye was different from Lv Yang. He didn't have any powerful magical arts, but he clearly didn't need those fancy things to fight. [[1857 旁白 neutral]]
He just had to throw out his magical treasures and make them self-destruct. That was enough. [[1858 旁白 neutral]]
This tactic made Liu Xin's already dark face even uglier. He waved the Myriad Spirit Banner and instantly summoned dozens of banner spirits. [[1859 旁白 neutral]]
These were all from his previous ambushes on fellow disciples. [[1860 旁白 neutral]]
"You all, go and support the formation." [[1861 刘信 neutral]]
Following Liu Xin's command, the banner spirits immediately moved. They positioned themselves around Fairy Qingchen's formation, strengthening its power. [[1862 旁白 neutral]]
Fairy Qingchen felt more confident seeing this. A small flag appeared in her hand, and she waved it. The mountains created by the formation immediately moved, locking down the area. This protected her and Liu Xin, blocking Lv Yang's sword light. [[1863 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin smiled with satisfaction and shook the Myriad Spirit Banner again. [[1864 旁白 neutral]]
He had found this strange treasure along with the "Innate Dao Scripture" during a lucky encounter. It was his greatest asset in battle. [[1865 旁白 neutral]]
The banner was said to have one main soul, two guardians, and three corpse gods. [[1866 旁白 neutral]]
It was said that the Dao creates one, one creates two, two create three, and three create all things. Only by filling these six positions and adding ten thousand souls would the treasure be complete. [[1867 旁白 neutral]]
It sounded simple, but Liu Xin had worked hard for over ten years without success. Ten thousand souls were easy to get; he could just go to the mortal world and destroy a city. However, he could never find the right souls for the six key positions. He hadn't even found the three corpse gods, let alone the two guardians. [[1868 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, the treasure was still very powerful. [[1869 旁白 neutral]]
"Kill them!" [[1870 刘信 angry]]
Liu Xin shook the banner, and thousands of souls flew out. Unlike the banner spirits, which were cultivators, these souls were resentful ghosts of ordinary people. [[1871 旁白 neutral]]
Although their quality was poor, there were many of them. [[1872 旁白 neutral]]
When Liu Xin summoned them, they swarmed like a huge wave, instantly covering Lv Yang. [[1873 旁白 neutral]]
More importantly, these were ghosts without flesh and blood, so they were not afraid of Lv Yang's Blood-Melting Divine Light! [[1874 旁白 neutral]]
However, Lv Yang was not afraid either. [[1875 旁白 neutral]]
The Blood-Melting Divine Light was his strongest technique, but not his only one. After refining his sword pellet, his Divine Empyrean Sword Control Art was also very powerful! [[1876 旁白 neutral]]
With a thought from Lv Yang, his sword pellet split into hundreds of sword lights. His figure began to teleport between the lights. He didn't fight the ghosts and banner spirits directly. He retreated when they advanced and attacked when they were tired, playing a guerrilla war with them. [[1877 旁白 neutral]]
This was the true advantage of a sword cultivator. [[1878 旁白 neutral]]
Attack with one strike, then retreat a thousand miles. Then attack from another direction, making the enemy tired and revealing a weakness, then deliver the final blow. [[1879 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, Lv Yang had killed most of the ten thousand resentful ghosts, and their army was scattered. [[1880 旁白 neutral]]
On the other side, Xiao Shiye also got serious. He threw out several high-quality magical treasures and made them self-destruct, shaking the formation that had just been stabilized. [[1881 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the situation turning against them, Fairy Qingchen couldn't help but look at Liu Xin: "Senior Brother..." [[1882 清尘仙子 fearful]]
"Don't worry. I'm not worried, so why are you?" [[1883 刘信 neutral]]
Liu Xin was still calm. He wasn't worried about Xiao Shiye, and he didn't believe Lv Yang could keep using his sword teleportation technique without using up his True Qi. [[1884 旁白 neutral]]
This was also part of his battle strategy. [[1885 旁白 neutral]]
First, he would send out the unimportant banner spirits to wear down the enemy. When their True Qi was low, he would use his trump card to win the battle. [[1886 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't want to use his trump card unless he had to. That banner spirit was too precious, and its identity was very sensitive. If anyone saw it, he would have to kill them. If even a small rumor got out, he would be doomed. [[1887 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh well, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs." [[1888 刘信 neutral]]
After thinking for a moment, Liu Xin finally raised the banner in his hand and bowed respectfully. "A strong enemy is here. To solve this problem, I must ask you for your help, Senior Brother." [[1889 刘信 neutral]]
