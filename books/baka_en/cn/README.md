# Translation Instructions for "Baka"

You are a master light novel translator and an expert English teacher. Your task is to translate the following Chinese light novel text into English, with the specific goal of creating a version that is suitable for a B1-level English learner.

The story is a dark-fantasy reincarnation story set in a brutal demonic cultivation sect. The protagonist, Lü Yang, is transmigrated into the body of a sickly, low-ranking "in-name disciple" destined to be used as a resource. He awakens a unique ability, the "Hundred Lives Book," which allows him to reincarnate at a key moment every time he dies, retaining a portion of his progress from the previous life. The narrative follows his journey as he navigates the treacherous and deadly environment, where "survival of the fittest" is the only rule, and even fellow disciples are just materials to be consumed.

Your translation must adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Preserve Original Intent:** Maintain the original dark, cynical, and ruthless tone. The translation should feel natural and engaging, not like a literal, word-for-word machine translation that results in "Chinglish."
2.  **Rewrite for B1-Level Clarity:** Adapt sentence structures to be clear and idiomatic in English. Use vocabulary and grammar appropriate for a B1 proficiency level. Avoid overly complex or obscure words, but don't oversimplify to the point of losing the original flavor. Rewrite sentences to sound as if they were originally written by a native English speaker.
3.  **Line-by-Line Formatting with Context:** Your translation must follow the original line-by-line structure. For each line, append a contextual marker with the format `[[{index} role emotion]]`.
    *   `{index}`: The original line number from the source text.
    *   `role`: The speaker or context. Use the character's Chinese name (e.g., `吕阳`, `玉素真`), `旁白` for narration, or `陌生男1`/`陌生女1` for new/unnamed characters. Refer to the `translation_reference.md` for established character names.
    *   `emotion`: The dominant emotion of the line. Choose one from: `neutral`, `happy`, `angry`, `sad`, `fearful`, `surprised`.
    *   **Example**:
        *   **Source:** `“师弟为何发笑啊？” [[134]]`
        *   **Output:** `"Why are you laughing, Junior Brother?" [[134 玉素真 angry]]`
        *   **Source:** `他刚穿越过来，一睁眼就出现在了这里，身体里的残留记忆则是告诉他，他如今的处境似乎不太妙。 [[6]]`
        *   **Output:** `He had just transmigrated and appeared here as soon as he opened his eyes. The lingering memories in his body told him that his current situation was not very good. [[6 旁白 neutral]]`
4.  **Consistency:** Use the provided `books/baka_en/cn/translation_reference.md` file to ensure consistent translation of character names, specific terms, and locations.
5.  Save the final, formatted result directly into a new .txt file (e.g., 0001.txt) within the `/books/baka_en/` folder.
Translate the text from `books/baka_en/cn/cn.txt` following these instructions.
