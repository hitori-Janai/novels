Chapter 21: Unexpected Disaster [[1669 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother Xiao is indeed a handsome and talented person." [[1670 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang laughed and patted Xiao Shiye's shoulder. "I'm Lv Yang. We probably joined at the same time, so I'm not really your senior brother." [[1671 吕阳 happy]]
"The same group?" [[1672 萧石叶 surprised]]
Xiao Shiye was surprised to hear this, and then his face showed admiration. "In that case, Brother Lv's talent must be excellent, or you wouldn't have reached this level of cultivation." [[1673 萧石叶 surprised]]
"I don't deserve such praise." [[1674 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang waved his hand. He knew his own limits. His talent was definitely not good. He relied on taking pills for his usual cultivation and on evil techniques to break through bottlenecks. [[1675 旁白 neutral]]
If he had cultivated step by step, he would probably still be stuck at the third level of Qi Refining. [[1676 旁白 neutral]]
After learning that Lv Yang was his peer, Xiao Shiye was no longer as reserved as before and quickly became friendly with him. After they chatted for a while, Lv Yang tentatively said, "I just had a breakthrough and was planning to go back to my cave to stabilize my cultivation. Where are you heading next, Brother Xiao?" [[1677 吕阳 neutral]]
"To be honest, Brother Lv, I plan to visit the Merit Pool." [[1678 萧石叶 neutral]]
Xiao Shiye smiled and said, "I heard that the Merit Pool is the ultimate test of luck. It just so happens that I've been quite lucky recently, so I want to take this chance to try my luck." [[1679 萧石叶 happy]]
"The Merit Pool." [[1680 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's interest was piqued, and on a sudden whim, he said, "In that case, why don't we go together?" [[1681 吕阳 neutral]]
He had already tried the number Xiao Shiye had won with in his past life, so he was very curious about what Xiao Shiye would choose this time and whether there was truly some foul play involved. [[1682 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, in a sea of clouds outside Wanbao Peak. [[1683 旁白 neutral]]
More than ten figures stood silently. The one in the lead was a handsome young man in a white robe who looked dashing, surrounded by clouds and mist. [[1684 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, one of them suddenly showed a happy expression: [[1685 旁白 neutral]]
"Senior Brother Liu, that person with the surname Xiao has come out." [[1686 陌生男1 happy]]
Before he finished speaking, the handsome young man seemed to awaken from his meditation. The clouds dispersed, revealing a face that Lv Yang would never forget. [[1687 旁白 neutral]]
It was Liu Xin! [[1688 旁白 surprised]]
At this time, Liu Xin had also broken through to the late stage of Qi Refining. As a cultivator of the "Innate Dao Scripture," he had an air of immortal grace that ordinary cultivators lacked. [[1689 旁白 neutral]]
"He's finally out..." Liu Xin smiled. On the surface, he showed none of the fierceness of a demonic cultivator. Instead, he had a friendly and approachable aura. However, when he activated his true qi and used a looking technique to gaze in Xiao Shiye's direction, his smile suddenly froze. [[1690 旁白 neutral]]
"...Late-stage Qi Refining?" [[1691 刘信 surprised]]
Liu Xin frowned slightly. He had not expected a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator to be with Xiao Shiye. This was a variable that could make him change his plan. [[1692 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a soft sound of surprise came from beside Liu Xin. [[1693 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Xin turned his head and smiled gently, "What is it, Qingchen? Do you know that late-stage Qi Refining cultivator?" [[1694 刘信 neutral]]
Hearing this, the charming woman standing behind Liu Xin pursed her red lips, "To be honest, Senior Brother Liu, I do know that late-stage Qi Refining cultivator." [[1695 清尘 neutral]]
Then, the woman said with a hateful tone, "That person's name is Lv Yang. He is a disciple who joined a few months ago. In the Death-Substitution Yin Puppet incident, he left early and made a fortune, at least ten thousand contribution points! He must have used that huge sum to break through to the late stage of Qi Refining." [[1696 清尘 angry]]
The charming woman was the same Fairy Qingchen who had been with Zhao Xuhe in the previous life. [[1697 旁白 neutral]]
But unlike the last life, this Qingchen had broken up with Zhao Xuhe early on and was now Liu Xin's lover. [[1698 旁白 neutral]]
The reason for the breakup was simple: Zhao Xuhe had pulled her into speculating on the Death-Substitution Yin Puppets. [[1699 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe went bankrupt, and so did Fairy Qingchen. [[1700 旁白 neutral]]
Incidentally, Liu Xin had also speculated. [[1701 旁白 neutral]]
Because the impact of the Death-Substitution Yin Puppets was much greater in this life, their losses were far greater than in the previous life when the bubble burst. [[1702 旁白 neutral]]
Not only were they on the verge of bankruptcy, but they also had a large amount of external debt. [[1703 旁白 neutral]]
Because of this, they had to resort to robbing fellow disciples—something they hadn't done in the previous life—to cover the losses from the puppet speculation. [[1704 旁白 neutral]]
Over time, they even formed a team. Its members were disciples who had some background in the sect but had gone bankrupt from the puppet speculation. Their targets were the ordinary disciples who had made a lot of money by starting with little capital and getting out early. [[1705 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Shiye was their most recent target. [[1706 旁白 neutral]]
And now, after hearing about Lv Yang's deeds from Fairy Qingchen, Liu Xin's eyes grew brighter. He had clearly made Lv Yang a target as well. [[1707 旁白 neutral]]
"There's no time to lose. Let's move!" [[1708 刘信 angry]]
With Liu Xin's command, everyone present let out a cold laugh. Then, they each mounted their light rays and flew towards Lv Yang and Xiao Shiye. [[1709 旁白 neutral]]
Just after leaving Wanbao Peak and flying for some distance in the sea of clouds, Lv Yang suddenly frowned. The sword core between his eyebrows throbbed as a warning. [[1710 旁白 fearful]]
Looking in the direction of the warning, Lv Yang's frown deepened. [[1711 旁白 fearful]]
He saw rays of light flying towards them from all directions, with him and Xiao Shiye at the center, like a large net closing in on their position. [[1712 旁白 fearful]]
Before long, a voice came from behind. [[1713 旁白 neutral]]
"Fellow Daoist, please wait!" [[1714 陌生男1 neutral]]
Lv Yang's face darkened when he heard this. [[1715 旁白 angry]]
To say something like that, they clearly had bad intentions! [[1716 旁白 angry]]
Lv Yang didn't look back. He ignored the voice behind him and frantically pushed his magic power, wrapping Xiao Shiye in his sword light and fleeing towards the Merit Pool. [[1717 旁白 fearful]]
However, the other party was clearly prepared. Lv Yang stopped after flying only a short distance. He looked around and saw that the surrounding sea of clouds had thinned out at some point. In its place was a vast mirage, strange and colorful, trapping him and Xiao Shiye in the center! [[1718 旁白 surprised]]
"Such an unexpected disaster." [[1719 吕阳 sad]]
Lv Yang looked grim. He used his looking technique to observe from a distance and gritted his teeth, "One late-stage Qi Refining, seven mid-stage Qi Refining... the chance of winning is at most thirty percent." [[1720 吕阳 fearful]]
What should I do? [[1721 旁白 neutral]]
As Lv Yang was thinking about a plan, Xiao Shiye, who was beside him, suddenly spoke up, "Brother Lv, if I'm not mistaken, these people should all be after me." [[1722 萧石叶 sad]]
At this point, Xiao Shiye had a regretful look on his face. "I was careless. These people must be after my magic treasures and contribution points. I thought they had given up after several months, but I didn't expect them to be so persistent. Now, let's split up and escape." [[1723 萧石叶 sad]]
"Split up and escape?" [[1724 吕阳 surprised]]
Lv Yang shook his head. "The enemy has already sealed this area of clouds, seemingly with a powerful magic treasure. I'm afraid we can't escape." [[1725 吕阳 fearful]]
"Don't worry, I have a way to deal with it." [[1726 萧石叶 neutral]]
Xiao Shiye whispered, "I have two 'Treasure-Breaking Awls.' As long as I use them, I can open a path to escape. I'm willing to give one to you, Brother Lv." [[1727 萧石叶 neutral]]
"Brother Lv, you go first. I'll cover the rear." [[1728 萧石叶 neutral]]
After saying that, he directly handed an awl to Lv Yang. [[1729 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang weighed it in his hand. Circulating his magic power, he immediately understood that Xiao Shiye was not lying. This magic treasure indeed had a high chance of breaking the surrounding mirage. [[1730 旁白 neutral]]
"...Are you sure you want me to go first?" Lv Yang's expression was strange. [[1731 吕阳 surprised]]
"Brother Lv, the road ahead is long. We will meet again someday." [[1732 萧石叶 sad]]
Xiao Shiye cupped his hands, a smile of relief on his face. Then he turned around to face the enemy, clearly prepared to die. [[1733 旁白 sad]]
Lv Yang fell into deep thought when he saw this. [[1734 旁白 neutral]]
He had been in seclusion for three months and had never made any enemies. It was impossible that these people were targeting him. Besides, compared to him, Xiao Shiye was obviously the bigger prize. [[1735 旁白 neutral]]
So, what Xiao Shiye said was correct. [[1736 旁白 neutral]]
If he abandoned him, he would most likely be able to escape. [[1737 旁白 neutral]]
So, should he do it? [[1738 旁白 neutral]]
Above the sea of clouds, watching Xiao Shiye press forward, seemingly indifferent to life and death, Lv Yang's sword core between his eyebrows pulsed with warning, and his expression was uncertain. [[1739 旁白 neutral]]
