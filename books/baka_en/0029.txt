Chapter 29: Karma Attracts Trouble [[2283 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe's words made Lv Yang feel as if he had been plunged into an icy cavern. [[2284 旁白 fearful]]
In this life, he hadn't even been to Coiling Dragon Island. He had memorized the cultivation technique from his past two lives. So how could the island have just disappeared on its own? [[2285 吕阳 surprised]]
Was it because of so-called karma? [[2286 吕阳 neutral]]
Because he had practiced the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art" early, he had intercepted the karma between it and Zhao Xuhe, so Coiling Dragon Island disappeared as well? [[2287 吕阳 surprised]]
The karma of a cultivation technique, a predetermined opportunity. [[2288 旁白 neutral]]
So this was Zhao Xuhe's destined opportunity. He couldn't take it or practice it, or else someone would immediately deduce the karma and follow the trail to his door? [[2289 吕阳 angry]]
After figuring this out, Lv Yang was so angry that he laughed instead. [[2290 旁白 angry]]
This world is so damn disgusting! [[2291 吕阳 angry]]
Powerful True Masters calculate destinies in advance for their disciples' benefit. If something goes wrong, they can find out who caused it and force the derailed karma back on track. [[2292 吕阳 angry]]
In a situation like this, how could an ordinary person ever get ahead? [[2293 吕阳 angry]]
They can only bow their heads and work like beasts of burden! [[2294 吕陽 angry]]
Just like now. On the surface, only Zhao Xuhe has appeared, but the one truly making a move is probably his so-called "Master"! [[2295 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang was one hundred percent sure it had to be a Foundation Establishment True Master! [[2296 旁白 neutral]]
Lifting his head, Lv Yang once again recalled Daoist Hong Yun from his previous life, as if seeing a pair of eyes looking down from the vast sky above. [[2297 旁白 neutral]]
"...Why are you forcing me?" [[2298 吕阳 angry]]
At this thought, anger surged in Lv Yang's heart, and malice grew. He looked at Zhao Xuhe, a mocking smile on his lips. [[2299 旁白 angry]]
Almost at the same time, a person next to Zhao Xuhe suddenly stepped forward. [[2300 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, be careful!" [[2301 陌生男1 fearful]]
Swoosh! [[2302 旁白 neutral]]
A flash of sword light, and Zhao Xuhe's vision blurred. When he could see clearly again, the rage that filled him was instantly extinguished by a chilling cold. [[2303 旁白 fearful]]
The person who had just stepped forward was a disciple of the same "Master," having joined three years earlier than him. He had cultivated the Dragon-Tiger Intercourse Yin-Yang Great Joy Sutra to the sixth level of Qi Refining, the peak of the middle stage. His true qi was polished to the fifth-grade limit, and in terms of strength, he was much stronger than Zhao Xuhe. [[2304 旁白 neutral]]
But now, that Senior Brother was gone. [[2305 旁白 surprised]]
His flesh, blood, and bones had been completely consumed by a crimson divine light. In the blink of an eye, only an empty human skin was left, slowly falling to the ground. [[2306 旁白 fearful]]
The next moment, a spiritual light flew out from the human skin. [[2307 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you, fellow Daoist, for freeing me." [[2308 陌生男1 happy]]
Within the spiritual light, a faint figure appeared. There was no anger at being killed by Lv Yang's sword; instead, there was a sense of joyful release. [[2309 旁白 surprised]]
Then, he looked at Zhao Xuhe. [[2310 旁白 neutral]]
"Junior Brother, before we came, Master commented that my foundation was not deep and my merits were few. He said it would be difficult for me to reach the peak of Qi Refining, and that Foundation Establishment was hopeless." [[2311 陌生男1 sad]]
"I asked Master for guidance, and he ordered me to come with you and save your life at a critical moment. You have accumulated three lifetimes of merit and have a thirty percent chance of achieving Foundation Establishment in the future. Now that I have saved you, our karma is set. If you achieve Foundation Establishment, you must help my reincarnated self in my cultivation." [[2312 陌生男1 neutral]]
As his voice fell, the spiritual light soared into the sky. [[2313 旁白 neutral]]
Below, Lv Yang's expression grew colder as he watched. [[2314 旁白 angry]]
"...Using my hand to create a karmic bond for his own disciple, to allow him to reincarnate? Is he so sure that I can't cause any trouble, and he wants to squeeze every last bit of value out of me?" [[2315 吕阳 angry]]
Lv Yang's gaze shifted, and he saw Chu Sheng Sect disciples stepping out from beside Zhao Xuhe, one after another. All of them were at the sixth level of Qi Refining, the peak of the middle stage. [[2316 旁白 surprised]]
At the same time, Zhao Xuhe finally reacted, his face full of excitement as he shouted, "Senior Brothers, if you help me capture this thief today and reclaim my opportunity, I will do my best to repay you when I achieve Foundation Establishment. I will help you all reincarnate and achieve the perfection of Qi Refining!" [[2317 赵旭河 happy]]
Hearing this, the others all nodded. [[2318 旁白 neutral]]
"Rest assured, Junior Brother." [[2319 陌生男2 neutral]]
"Opportunities belong to those who are fated for them. This thief stole your opportunity without reason; his crime is unforgivable. With Master watching over us, we will certainly help you capture him!" [[2320 陌生男2 angry]]
Lv Yang laughed loudly when he heard this. "After all is said and done, isn't this just robbery?" [[2321 吕阳 angry]]
"You're hopelessly stubborn." [[2322 陆元淳 angry]]
The leading Chu Sheng Sect disciple shook his head and sneered, "My name is Lu Yuanchun. Since you refuse to be captured, don't blame me for being merciless." [[2323 陆元淳 angry]]
As his voice fell, the man named Lu Yuanchun formed a hand seal. His aura was at the seventh level of Qi Refining, the late stage. He then summoned a golden mirror that hung high in the air, replacing the sun. It instantly cast down thousands of golden rays, sharper than any blade, engulfing Lv Yang like a torrential downpour. [[2324 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang's brow furrowed at the sight, and his figure vanished in an instant. [[2325 旁白 neutral]]
Immediately after, a sword light soared into the sky, splitting into thousands of copies. It darted left and right but couldn't escape the golden rays, forced to endure the attack head-on. [[2326 旁白 neutral]]
"Master already knew this thief was skilled with a sword. How could he not provide a way to counter it?" [[2327 陆元淳 happy]]
Lu Yuanchun smiled smugly, then looked at Zhao Xuhe. "Junior Brother Zhao, I have trapped this thief, making it difficult for him to use his sword arts to escape." [[2328 陆元淳 happy]]
"Please use your treasure seal to capture his flying sword, and this matter will be settled!" [[2329 陆元淳 happy]]
"Thank you, Senior Brother!" [[2330 赵旭河 happy]]
Zhao Xuhe cupped his hands and, without delay, took out a glittering golden seal. He cast it into the air, and it descended upon Lv Yang's sword light. [[2331 旁白 neutral]]
"This thing again..." [[2332 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang's eyes narrowed slightly. He recognized it as the "Primal Magnetism Gold Seal" that Zhao Xuhe had used in his second life, a treasure specifically designed to counter flying swords. [[2333 旁白 neutral]]
Having learned his lesson from his past life, Lv Yang wouldn't let Zhao Xuhe use it freely. With a thought, the Blood Sun Sword Pellet moved as he willed it. It avoided contact with the Primal Magnetism Gold Seal, then turned its sword light into a sky-full of Blood-Devouring Divine Light, sweeping towards Zhao Xuhe. [[2334 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe was shocked and retreated in a panic, crying out, "Senior Brother!" [[2335 赵旭河 fearful]]
"Don't panic. It's just the struggle of a cornered beast." [[2336 陆元淳 neutral]]
On the other side, Lu Yuanchun remained calm and said loudly, "Junior Brothers, please act now." [[2337 陆元淳 neutral]]
As soon as he finished speaking, several more Chu Sheng Sect disciples stepped forward with strange smiles on their faces. They committed suicide before the divine light even reached them. [[2338 旁白 surprised]]
Instantly, rays of blood-red light burst from their corpses. [[2339 旁白 neutral]]
These blood-red lights acted like chains, temporarily trapping Lv Yang's Blood-Devouring Divine Light, making it difficult to retract and control. [[2340 旁白 surprised]]
Zhao Xuhe and Lu Yuanchun had clearly come prepared. [[2341 旁白 neutral]]
Especially Lu Yuanchun, who had been secretly instructed by their Master and knew many of Lv Yang's secrets. Thus, he had prepared many countermeasures. [[2342 旁白 neutral]]
So, before the fight, he had set a strategy: first, limit Lv Yang's speed to prevent his escape; then, have Zhao Xuhe suppress the sword pellet; finally, have the other junior brothers work together to suppress the Blood-Devouring Divine Light. No matter how powerful Lv Yang's abilities were, he would be like a lamb to the slaughter. [[2343 旁白 neutral]]
"You're at the end of your rope. The outcome is decided!" [[2344 陆元淳 happy]]
Lu Yuanchun sneered, feeling that his victory was assured. He shook the golden mirror, and thousands of golden rays rained down, intending to refine Lv Yang to death. [[2345 旁白 angry]]
Seeing this, Lv Yang could only sigh. [[2346 吕阳 sad]]
"So this is the advantage of having a powerful backer..." [[2347 吕阳 sad]]
With his current strength, even against multiple opponents, Lu Yuanchun and Zhao Xuhe were no match for him. However, their preparations were just too thorough. [[2348 旁白 neutral]]
Every move struck at his weakness. [[2349 旁白 neutral]]
And all of this was because of Zhao Xuhe's mysterious "Master," who had deduced the karma and calculated his fate, leading to such a targeted plan. [[2350 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, at this point, he would indeed be powerless to turn the tide. [[2351 旁白 neutral]]
"Fortunately... I have a cheat!" [[2352 吕阳 happy]]
The Blood Sun Sword Pellet was brought from his previous life by the [Hundred Lives Book]. It was not bound by karma and naturally immune to any divination. [[2353 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Zhao Xuhe's mysterious "Master" could predict his skill with a sword and the Blood-Devouring Divine Light, he could never have predicted the true nature of the Blood Sun Sword Pellet! [[2354 旁白 happy]]
The next moment, with a thought, Lv Yang channeled his true qi again. [[2355 旁白 neutral]]
Clang clang—! [[2356 旁白 neutral]]
The Blood Sun Sword Pellet let out a long cry. Then, the array patterns on the pellet suddenly burst open, sealing the heavens and the earth, instantly enveloping everyone within! [[2357 旁白 surprised]]
In the blink of an eye, Lv Yang had deployed the grand array he had spent twenty years of his past life studying and perfecting! [[2358 旁白 neutral]]
