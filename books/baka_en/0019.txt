Chapter 19: Skinning [[1523 旁白 neutral]]
"Do you really want to learn these special techniques?" [[1524 王柏荣 surprised]]
Seeing Lv Yang's interested expression, Wang Bairong was also a bit surprised. He couldn't help but say, "Junior Brother, in the path of cultivation, your realm always comes first. You must know what is most important." [[1525 王柏荣 surprised]]
In his opinion, Lv Yang had earned so many contribution points at such a young age. Even if he couldn't reach Foundation Establishment, he had a good chance of mastering Qi Refining. Why would he practice special techniques with such huge side effects? Even if his fighting power was unmatched, what would it matter? When his life ended, he would just be a pile of dust. [[1526 旁白 neutral]]
"Life is short, don't waste it." [[1527 王柏荣 sad]]
At this point, Wang Bairong had a sad expression on his face. "You are still young, so you don't understand this. A flower may bloom again, but a person cannot be young again." [[1528 王柏荣 sad]]
"You are strong and full of energy now, but what about in ten years? Or twenty?" [[1529 王柏荣 sad]]
"The choice you make today might seem satisfying, but you might only see the bad effects decades later. By then, it will be too late for regrets." [[1530 王柏荣 sad]]
Before he finished speaking, Wang Bairong seemed to get lost in his memories. After a while, he said with emotion, "You don't know, but when I was young, I was quite famous in the sect. But I made one wrong step, and it wasted my whole life. Even now, it's incredibly painful to think about." [[1531 王柏荣 sad]]
As he spoke, Wang Bairong's eyes turned red. [[1532 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling the effects of the wine, he pulled Lv Yang over and began to talk about his glorious past. [[1533 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't much, really. When he was young, he didn't understand how important the quality of his True Qi was. He happened to find a technique below the seventh grade and started practicing it. [[1534 旁白 neutral]]
As a result, the quality of his True Qi was too low. He had no hope of reaching Foundation Establishment, and it was even hard to complete Qi Refining. [[1535 旁白 neutral]]
For decades, he felt like he was halfway in his grave, while his former junior brothers and the women he admired extended their lives one by one, remaining young even now. [[1536 旁白 sad]]
How much regret and pain that must cause. But who can start life over again? [[1537 旁白 sad]]
"What? I can start over? Then it's not a problem." [[1538 吕阳 neutral]]
Seeing that Wang Bairong had passed out drunk, Lv Yang stood up and, following Wang Bairong's description, found the book, "Heavenly Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light." [[1539 旁白 neutral]]
It was undeniably a demonic technique. [[1540 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang exchanged his points for it with a serious expression. "Fast to learn, big side effects, very dangerous. It has almost all the features a demonic path should have." [[1541 吕阳 neutral]]
To master this special technique, one must first choose a magic artifact. Then, use the artifact to peel off one's own skin while still alive. The skin is then refined with a secret method for eighty-one days to create a ray of blood-transforming light. This light attaches to the artifact, and an ordinary cultivator would be injured by a scratch and killed by a touch. [[1542 旁白 neutral]]
"At the same time, I will become a blood shadow that depends on the magic artifact to exist." [[1543 吕阳 neutral]]
"If the artifact is not destroyed, the blood shadow will not die." [[1544 吕阳 neutral]]
"The side effects are that my lifespan will be cut in half, and after I become a blood shadow, I will no longer have a human body, just a human form. Because of this, my cultivation level will not improve." [[1545 吕阳 neutral]]
"Good, this is perfect for me!" [[1546 吕阳 happy]]
Lv Yang's eyes were bright, and he immediately decided to practice this special technique. [[1547 旁白 neutral]]
While studying it, he discovered that there was another version of this technique. It seemed that a powerful cultivator had edited and improved it. [[1548 旁白 neutral]]
"After all, this special technique is truly extraordinary." [[1549 吕阳 neutral]]
"The modified version doesn't require the cultivator to skin themselves for the blood sacrifice. Instead, it lets the cultivator sacrifice their own brother or their children and grandchildren." [[1550 吕阳 neutral]]
"This way, one can still master the technique. However, because the blood shadow created is not the cultivator's own, it's hard to control freely, and there's a risk of it backfiring. But I'm different. Whether it's in this life or the next, the blood shadow will only be me!" [[1551 吕阳 neutral]]
A few days later, Lv Yang left the Library Pavilion. [[1552 旁白 neutral]]
He also bought the "Divine Empyrean True Sword Art" again at full price. After all, this was the only way he could use it openly in the future. [[1553 旁白 neutral]]
The next day, the "technique" was delivered. [[1554 旁白 neutral]]
"Demon!" [[1555 云妙清 angry]]
Looking at Yun Miaoqing, who was gripping the magic sword at her neck with a defiant expression, Lv Yang suddenly felt as if a lifetime had passed. [[1556 旁白 neutral]]
But he quickly pushed the thought away. [[1557 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, I need the method and experience for refining a sword pellet." [[1558 吕阳 neutral]]
"What? How did you know... Wait... you...!" [[1559 云妙清 surprised]]
Practice makes perfect. Using his familiarity with Yun Miaoqing, Lv Yang went all out and quickly extracted the knowledge and experience he needed from her. [[1560 旁白 neutral]]
After pulling up his pants, Lv Yang turned and left. [[1561 旁白 neutral]]
This time, he went to "Ten Thousand Treasures Peak," the peak corresponding to the Outer Hall's Treasure Refining Hall and one of the four Inner Peaks. Most of the sect's magic artifacts came from here. [[1562 旁白 neutral]]
"I want to rent an earth-fire furnace." [[1563 吕阳 neutral]]
Arriving at the front desk, Lv Yang stated his request directly. After paying enough contribution points, he was shown into the highest-grade furnace room a quarter of an hour later. [[1564 旁白 neutral]]
After preparing, he took out the materials. [[1565 旁白 neutral]]
Three ounces of gold essence, three ounces of jade marrow, two ounces of cinnabar, and two ounces of sword qi. Then, he formed a hand seal, drew fire from the earth's core, and threw everything into the furnace! [[1566 旁白 neutral]]
"Although most sword pellets from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion are made by sect elders, that's in a righteous sect, where you don't have to worry about someone secretly sabotaging it. This is the Chu Sheng Sect. Rather than trusting the morals of an artifact refiner, I'd rather do it myself. If it fails, I'll just try a few more times." [[1567 吕阳 neutral]]
One set of materials cost 2,000 contribution points. [[1568 旁白 neutral]]
Lv Yang had only earned a total of 10,000 contribution points. After buying the special technique, the cultivation art, and paying off his debt, he could only afford three sets of materials for the sword pellet. [[1569 旁白 neutral]]
"If I fail three times, then I'll try again in the next life!" [[1570 吕阳 neutral]]
With this thought, Lv Yang began to strictly follow the method and experience he had taken from Yun Miaoqing, carefully controlling the earth-fire to slowly refine all the materials. [[1571 旁白 neutral]]
Gold essence fused with jade marrow, cinnabar combined with sword qi... [[1572 旁白 neutral]]
Gradually, a pellet appeared in Lv Yang's spiritual sense. However, before he could feel happy, the pellet suddenly trembled... [[1573 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom!" [[1574 旁白 neutral]]
It exploded. [[1575 旁白 neutral]]
One set of materials was wasted. Lv Yang calmly waved his sleeve to clear away the debris and quietly analyzed the lessons learned. "...My steps should have been correct." [[1576 吕阳 neutral]]
"The problem was the final step." [[1577 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang reviewed Yun Miaoqing's memories, and understanding slowly appeared in his eyes: [[1578 旁白 neutral]]
"To refine a sword pellet, the sword and mind must be one. I haven't been practicing the Divine Empyrean True Sword Art for long, so my skill in the way of the sword is clearly lacking..." [[1579 吕阳 neutral]]
Normally, this was a strict requirement that could only be met with time. [[1580 旁白 neutral]]
But that was from the perspective of a righteous path, which valued gradual progress and rarely used quick, heaven-defying methods. [[1581 旁白 neutral]]
The demonic path did not care about such things. [[1582 旁白 neutral]]
"Sword and mind as one is ultimately about controlling the sword pellet... In that case, if I practice the Heavenly Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light at the same time, the effect should be the same!" [[1583 吕阳 neutral]]
"The effect might even be better!" [[1584 吕阳 happy]]
After all, the Heavenly Demon's Blood-Transforming Divine Light was a technique where one sacrificed their body to an artifact. Once mastered, the user would nearly become one with the artifact, a connection far stronger than the so-called "sword and mind as one." [[1585 旁白 neutral]]
"But to do this, I can't use the anesthetic I prepared..." [[1586 吕阳 neutral]]
Refining a sword pellet was a delicate process. If he took a drug to suppress the pain and his reaction was even slightly delayed, he would likely fail. [[1587 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, he had to remain fully conscious the entire time. [[1588 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the demonic path. You have to be cruel to yourself... Otherwise, how can you be considered a true talent?" [[1589 吕阳 neutral]]
Thinking this, a ruthless look appeared in Lv Yang's eyes. [[1590 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, he sat before the earth-fire furnace, stuffed a piece of cloth into his mouth, and waited for the sword pellet to form again. Then, he directed the sword qi to strike his own body... [[1591 旁白 neutral]]
