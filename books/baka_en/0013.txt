Chapter 13: The Mantis Stalks the Cicada, Unaware of the Oriole Behind [[1021 旁白 neutral]]
Outside Sky Mending Peak, more than ten formal disciples gathered together. The leaders were Zhao Xuhe, Fairy Qingchen, and the old man from the Library Pavilion, Wang Borong. [[1022 旁白 neutral]]
Among them, only these three had reached the mid-stage of Qi Refining. [[1023 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe stood at the very front and spoke in a resonant voice, "I am deeply honored that all you fellow brothers could accept my invitation. I thank you in advance." [[1024 赵旭河 neutral]]
After saying this, he bowed to everyone. [[1025 旁白 neutral]]
"To tell you the truth, I found a cave residence left behind by a predecessor outside Sky Mending Peak. Unfortunately, it is protected by a formation, and I am not strong enough to break it." [[1026 赵旭河 neutral]]
Fairy Qingchen spoke at the right time, her gentle voice making people feel numb. "That's why I came to you, my fellow brothers. We can break the formation together and split the treasures inside the cave residence. Brother Zhao is a member of the Three Rivers Association, and everyone knows he is trustworthy. He definitely won't let you suffer a loss." [[1027 清尘仙子 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe was clearly a man of some means. [[1028 旁白 neutral]]
He and Fairy Qingchen worked together, with Wang Borong, the old man from the Library Pavilion, playing a supporting role. Soon, they united the disorganized group. [[1029 旁白 neutral]]
Then, the group rode their escape lights and left Sky Mending Peak. [[1030 旁白 neutral]]
The "Cloud Sea Touching the Sky," where the Chu Sheng Sect was located, was vast and seemingly endless. After flying for a quarter of an hour, the group stopped over a part of the cloud sea. [[1031 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the place." [[1032 赵旭河 neutral]]
With a thought, Zhao Xuhe used his true qi to part the clouds, revealing a magnificent mountain peak with excellent feng shui. At first glance, it looked like an old dragon coiled up. [[1033 旁白 neutral]]
"This place is called Panlong Island," Zhao Xuhe explained. "I have investigated it. This was the cave residence of Perfected Master Panlong, a true disciple of our sect. The feng shui formation outside was once a Foundation Establishment-level formation, but over many years, the earth veins it relied on have dried up, and its power is less than one-tenth of what it was." [[1034 赵旭河 neutral]]
"Everyone, please follow me to break the formation." [[1035 赵旭河 neutral]]
As soon as he finished speaking, Zhao Xuhe led the way and was the first to enter Panlong Island. The others saw this and did not dare to fall behind, flying in one by one. [[1036 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment, a figure quietly appeared. [[1037 旁白 neutral]]
"Interesting." [[1038 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang looked down at Panlong Island but had no intention of entering. Instead, he took out four black banners and began to set them up outside the island. [[1039 旁白 neutral]]
"The repayment deadline is approaching anyway. There's not much time left in this life." [[1040 吕阳 neutral]]
"Might as well go for a big score!" [[1041 吕阳 neutral]]
"But this Panlong Island is treacherous, and Zhao Xuhe has a large group. I'm alone and have no chance of winning if I go in to compete with them for opportunities." [[1042 吕阳 neutral]]
After thinking it over, Lv Yang came up with a good plan. [[1043 旁白 neutral]]
First, he didn't believe for a second that there were good people in a demonic sect. He was certain that Zhao Xuhe's plan to bring people to the cave residence was ill-intentioned. [[1044 旁白 neutral]]
However, with so many people here, including the old man from the Library Pavilion, Wang Borong, even if Zhao Xuhe could defeat them all, he would surely suffer some losses and not escape unharmed. That being the case, he could set up a formation outside the island first, wait for the exhausted, and ambush whoever came out. [[1045 旁白 neutral]]
Isn't that a much better deal than exploring inside? [[1046 旁白 neutral]]
For this reason, Lv Yang even spent his last 100 contribution points on a Bewildering Formation set. [[1047 旁白 neutral]]
The four "Bewildering Banners" could lock down the area and confuse directions. Although they had no offensive power, they could trap people inside, making it difficult to escape in a short time. [[1048 旁白 neutral]]
"Now, all I have to do is wait quietly... No rush, patience is a virtue." [[1049 吕阳 neutral]]
Lv Yang patiently lay in ambush. [[1050 旁白 neutral]]
"Zhao Xuhe! What is the meaning of this!?" [[1051 陌生男1 angry]]
"If you kill us, our life lamps will go out, and the sect will not spare you!" [[1052 陌生男2 fearful]]
Inside Panlong Island, blood was already flowing like a river. [[1053 旁白 neutral]]
The group of formal disciples, who had been working together just moments ago, were now fighting for themselves, screaming as a bloody light harvested their lives one by one. [[1054 旁白 neutral]]
Far from the crowd, Zhao Xuhe and Fairy Qingchen stood side by side. [[1055 旁白 neutral]]
Their expressions were mocking and arrogant, revealing a sinister evil. Their behavior was completely different from the sincere manner they had when inviting everyone. [[1056 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the angry accusations, Zhao Xuhe sneered and said in a chilling tone, "Stop struggling. I have carefully arranged this place. This 'Blood Demon Soul-Slaying Blade' cost me a full 3,000 contribution points. None of you will escape Panlong Island today!" [[1057 赵旭河 angry]]
As he spoke, several more people were killed. [[1058 旁白 neutral]]
The bloody light flashed through the air, instantly sucking their flesh and blood dry, then revealing its form: a crimson flying dagger. [[1059 旁白 neutral]]
"You! Bastard!" [[1060 王柏荣 angry]]
In the crowd, the only one who could still resist was the old man from the Library Pavilion, Wang Borong. However, Zhao Xuhe was not in a hurry to kill him, but just kept wearing him down. [[1061 旁白 neutral]]
While wearing him down, Zhao Xuhe sneered, "Old man Wang, did you really think you could spend the money you took from me? The reason I bought your Death-Substitue Yin Skeletons was for today! Otherwise, if you had a pile of them, it wouldn't be easy for me to take you down." [[1062 赵旭河 angry]]
"Now, I've bought all of your Death-Substitue Yin Skeletons." [[1063 赵旭河 happy]]
"After I kill you, I can take back the contribution points I gave you. It's like I got a pile of Death-Substitue Yin Skeletons for free." [[1064 赵旭河 happy]]
"So it seems I have to thank you!" [[1065 赵旭河 happy]]
Zhao Xuhe's heart-piercing words made Wang Borong almost spit blood from anger. Zhao Xuhe seized the opportunity, and with a flash of the dagger, it plunged into his chest. [[1066 旁白 neutral]]
Thud! [[1067 旁白 neutral]]
Wang Borong's lips moved, his face full of unwillingness, but before he could say a word, the flying dagger sucked his lifeblood dry, and he fell to the ground. [[1068 旁白 neutral]]
With Wang Borong defeated, the dust settled. [[1069 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, the screams gradually stopped. [[1070 旁白 neutral]]
"Congratulations, Senior Brother!" [[1071 清尘仙子 happy]]
Fairy Qingchen was also drenched in sweat. The Blood Demon Soul-Slaying Blade consumed a great deal of energy, and she had played a part in Zhao Xuhe's ability to kill so many people. [[1072 旁白 neutral]]
"I must thank you too, Junior Sister." [[1073 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe smiled slightly, took back the Blood Demon Soul-Slaying Blade, and asked, "How is it? With its current power, can it break that restriction?" [[1074 赵旭河 neutral]]
Fairy Qingchen examined it for a moment, her brow furrowed slightly, "It seems to be a little bit short..." [[1075 清尘仙子 neutral]]
Swish—! [[1076 旁白 neutral]]
The blade went in and out. Fairy Qingchen's pretty face was blank, her eyes staring lifelessly at the crimson dagger that had entered her abdomen. In an instant, she too was sucked into a dried corpse. [[1077 旁白 surprised]]
"Not anymore." [[1078 赵旭河 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe looked at the Blood Demon Soul-Slaying Blade in his hand and nodded in satisfaction. He then walked to a tightly closed quiet room in the depths of Panlong Island. [[1079 旁白 neutral]]
Without a word, he raised the blade and struck. [[1080 旁白 neutral]]
"BOOM!" [[1081 旁白 neutral]]
With a sound like the shaking of the earth, the door to the quiet room shattered, revealing what was inside. There was a jade box. [[1082 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Xuhe walked over with a look of ecstasy and opened the jade box. Inside were two volumes of a Daoist scripture. [[1083 旁白 neutral]]
The first volume was titled "Nine Transformations Dragon Art". [[1084 旁白 neutral]]
The second volume was titled "Ten Thousand Vehicles Imperial Dragon Ascension Treasure Scroll". [[1085 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the two Daoist scriptures in the jade box, Zhao Xuhe's hands trembled with excitement. "A third-grade true technique! It really is a third-grade true technique that points directly to the Golden Core Grand Dao!" [[1086 赵旭河 happy]]
"Master truly did not lie to me." [[1087 赵旭河 happy]]
"Master said that I have cultivated bitterly for three lifetimes, accumulating merit for Perfected Master Panlong. In this life, my merits are finally complete, and Perfected Master Panlong's legacy is my opportunity." [[1088 赵旭河 happy]]
"From today on, as long as I cultivate diligently, refine 'True Dragon Qi,' and build the 'Ten Thousand Vehicles Imperial Dragon' Dao foundation, I will surely be able to find my true self and completely return from my reincarnation. With a third-grade true technique, not only will the path to Foundation Establishment be smooth, but the Golden Core Grand Dao will also be within reach!" [[1089 赵旭河 happy]]
The more Zhao Xuhe thought about it, the more excited he became. He immediately put away the Daoist scriptures. [[1090 旁白 neutral]]
"Changing techniques requires dissipating my current power. There's no time to lose. I must immediately return to my cave residence for secluded cultivation. When I emerge, I can formally become Master's disciple..." [[1091 赵旭河 neutral]]
Filled with hope for the future, Zhao Xuhe rode his escape light and flew quickly out of Panlong Island. [[1092 旁白 neutral]]
However, in the next second, Zhao Xuhe's expression changed dramatically. [[1093 旁白 neutral]]
"Who's there—" [[1094 赵旭河 surprised]]
"BOOM!" [[1095 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, Zhao Xuhe's eyes widened, but all he could see was a magnificent sword light, striking like a thunderbolt, instantly reaching him! [[1096 旁白 neutral]]
