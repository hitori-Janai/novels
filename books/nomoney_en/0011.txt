Chapter 11: Celestial Cycle Qi Gathering [[1178 旁白 neutral]]
In front of a skyscraper in the city center. [[1179 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu lifted his head and looked up at the towering building that seemed to pierce the sky. He could faintly see what looked like a celestial palace floating at the top of the skyscraper. [[1180 旁白 neutral]]
This was the Xianyun Group's office building in downtown Songyang. [[1181 旁白 neutral]]
Beyond that, Zhang Yu could also see an even taller giant building in the distance, as if it connected to the real edge of the sky. He knew that was Songyang City's tallest building, the legendary 999-floor Central Tower, which was also a landmark he often saw on his way to and from school. [[1182 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, he turned his head again to look at the office building in front of him. [[1183 旁白 neutral]]
"Xianyun Group?" [[1184 张羽 neutral]]
On the way here, Zhang Yu had already searched online for information about Xianyun Group. [[1185 旁白 neutral]]
This was a giant corporation under the Wanfa Sect, with business including developing cultivation techniques, selling cultivation techniques, cultivation education, books and cultural products, and more. [[1186 旁白 neutral]]
And the Wanfa Sect was one of the Ten Great Sects. In this Kunxu, from food, clothing, housing and transportation to birth, aging, sickness and death, a person's entire life was inseparable from the Ten Great Sects. Cultivation was naturally even more so. [[1187 旁白 neutral]]
So Zhang Yu was not surprised at all that a giant corporation like Xianyun Group belonged to the Wanfa Sect, one of the Ten Great Sects. [[1188 旁白 neutral]]
He walked into the building with his head down. After explaining his purpose at the front desk, Zhang Yu went through registration, contract signing, and a simple physical examination. Finally, he was led to a place that looked like a classroom. [[1189 旁白 neutral]]
He saw that besides him, several other students were already sitting in the classroom. [[1190 旁白 neutral]]
After waiting for a while, when the number of students in the classroom reached fifteen, a middle-aged man in a suit walked in and began explaining today's technique testing content. [[1191 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello everyone, I am today's instructor." [[1192 面试官 neutral]]
"Everyone here has already signed the contract, but I still need to remind you that everything we discuss here today cannot be shared with anyone. If our company discovers that any of you has leaked information, we will find you no matter where you run to." [[1193 面试官 angry]]
Hearing these words, the many students felt a chill in their hearts, but they knew the man's words were true. With Xianyun Group's strength and the Wanfa Sect behind them, doing this would indeed not be difficult. [[1194 旁白 neutral]]
"The cultivation technique you will try to learn today is what we call Experimental Technique Number 113. Now please everyone watch the instructional video first..." [[1195 面试官 neutral]]
According to the introduction in the short instructional film, this technique was a Qi Refining stage breathing technique, but unlike the basic breathing method, this technique was much more complex, like establishing some kind of mana circulation throughout the entire body. [[1196 旁白 neutral]]
So after watching the instructional video, most of the students who came to test the technique were still completely confused. [[1197 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until the instructor's detailed explanation that followed that the students had a rough understanding, but they felt increasingly scared. [[1198 旁白 neutral]]
"No way... you want us to practice this kind of technique? Are we qualified?" [[1199 陌生男1 angry]]
The cultivation route of this technique was really too complex and difficult, like trying to draw the Qingming Riverside Scene on a piece of A4 paper. [[1200 旁白 neutral]]
If Zhang Yu had to describe it, it was as difficult as carving flowers on poop. [[1201 旁白 neutral]]
Let alone following the cultivation route in the instruction to practice, everyone present couldn't even memorize the cultivation route. They had almost forgotten most of it right after the explanation. [[1202 旁白 neutral]]
Forget about spreading it - the students had no confidence at all about whether they could successfully practice this technique and complete the experiment. [[1203 旁白 neutral]]
Seeming to sense the emotional changes of the many students, the instructor said from above: "Everyone, don't worry. This experiment doesn't require you to master this technique." [[1204 面试官 neutral]]
"In fact, beginners cannot possibly master this technique on their own." [[1205 面试官 neutral]]
"What we're testing this time includes the auxiliary cultivation equipment that matches Technique 113..." [[1206 面试官 neutral]]
Next, all the students were sent to a testing room, where mana detection patches were attached to their hands, feet, chest, back, and other positions. [[1207 旁白 neutral]]
Then needle-like things connected to wires were brought in front of the students by mechanical arms. [[1208 旁白 neutral]]
The instructor continued: "When you start practicing, the detection patches will constantly monitor the flow of mana in your body." [[1209 面试官 neutral]]
"The magnetic needles will stimulate points along your mana circulation route under the control of mechanical arms, helping you identify and correct your cultivation route..." [[1210 面试官 neutral]]
After listening for a while, Zhang Yu understood - it was like automatic pathfinding... oh no, automatic technique finding. [[1211 旁白 neutral]]
Because Technique 113's mana route was too complex, with extremely high requirements for timing and positioning of spiritual energy and mana circulation, it needed to monitor the practitioner's cultivation path while using magnetic needles to stimulate various parts of the body for guidance. [[1212 旁白 neutral]]
However, this process was also quite dangerous, because Technique 113's cultivation route was too complex. [[1213 旁白 neutral]]
With such a complex cultivation route, if the mana circulation path had even the slightest error, it would cause mana to go out of control, overflow in the body, causing itching and pain, hot and cold sensations, easily leading to greater loss of control. [[1214 旁白 neutral]]
If it dragged on too long, it would cause internal injuries. The longer it dragged on, the more serious the internal injuries would become. [[1215 旁白 neutral]]
After that, you would either go to the hospital and pay a high price for a powerful cultivator to use strong mana to suppress the out-of-control mana in the injured person's body, or rely on physical strength to endure it and wait for the mana to naturally exhaust and dissipate, or the practitioner would master this technique themselves and use the technique to actively control the out-of-control scattered mana on the cultivation route. [[1216 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the instructor continued: "...Everything is as stated in the contracts you signed. The payment for this technique testing will be distributed according to the percentage of the cultivation route each of you completes. Only by completing 100% of the cultivation route can you receive the full ten thousand yuan." [[1217 面试官 neutral]]
"If the mana only goes halfway, then you'll only get five thousand." [[1218 面试官 neutral]]
"Alright everyone, if there are no problems, please begin." [[1219 面试官 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked at the information displayed on the Feather Book. [[1220 旁白 neutral]]
Celestial Cycle Qi Gathering Method Level 0 (0/1) [[1221 旁白 neutral]]
He thought to himself: "This means I just need to practice it once?" [[1222 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu closed his eyes and tried to circulate the technique he had just learned, starting from his dantian and moving toward his spine. [[1223 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, he felt a slight stinging sensation in his spine, knowing that was the magnetic needle guiding him to circulate mana there. [[1224 旁白 neutral]]
So he followed the magnetic needle's guidance, slowly circulating his mana bit by bit. [[1225 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1226 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, outside the testing room, a group of people were observing the students' condition. [[1227 旁白 neutral]]
"It's starting." [[1228 陌生男1 neutral]]
The lead researcher had messy short hair and was staring intently at the constantly changing data on the screen. [[1229 旁白 neutral]]
That showed the mana circulation situation in each student's body after they began trying to practice Experimental Technique 113. [[1230 旁白 neutral]]
The assistant beside him was also looking at the practice diagrams of each student on the screen with a serious expression. This was an image that described the students' internal mana circulation routes, compiled from the mana data from various parts of the students' bodies. [[1231 旁白 neutral]]
The correct circulation route was green, while parts where mana circulation deviated would be marked in red. [[1232 旁白 neutral]]
As time passed minute by minute, watching more and more red error markings appear on the circulation routes, disappointment kept showing in the assistant's eyes. [[1233 旁白 neutral]]
"Teacher, it seems the magnetic needles' guidance precision needs to be improved further, otherwise they can't meet the mana circulation precision needed for beginners practicing 113." [[1234 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Getting beginners to master 113 is still too difficult. Should we recruit some test subjects with higher Dao Heart levels?" [[1235 陌生男1 neutral]]
The researcher called teacher frowned: "Whether it's 113 or the magnetic needles, they were originally developed for beginners. I won't change this direction." [[1236 研究员 angry]]
"Besides, those with higher Dao Heart levels have better techniques to learn. 113's passive breathing effect lacks competitiveness among them. Instead, beginners need the passive breathing effect more..." [[1237 研究员 neutral]]
Just then, a student who made a mistake groaned and suddenly spit out a large mouthful of blood. [[1238 旁白 neutral]]
The 'teacher' said coldly: "Hurry up and get him out. Don't let him disturb the others' mental state." [[1239 研究员 angry]]
But with the first student spitting blood, more and more students trying to practice the technique began to feel unwell. Some had iron-blue faces and couldn't breathe, some screamed and fainted from pain, and some had minor injuries, just pale faces with pain or itching where they were circulating mana... [[1240 旁白 neutral]]
Watching student after student being carried out, the 'teacher's' expression became increasingly ugly. [[1241 旁白 neutral]]
He said unhappily: "This batch of students is too poor quality. Can't we recruit some capable students?" [[1242 研究员 angry]]
The assistant quietly explained: "Teacher, the previous test subjects were injured too severely. No schools are willing to cooperate with us anymore." [[1243 陌生男1 neutral]]
The 'teacher' snorted coldly, showing dissatisfaction on his face: "Just a bunch of poor students. Whether it's 113 or the magnetic needles, as long as they can be successfully improved, that's such a huge beginner market. What does it matter if a few hundred people die?" [[1244 研究员 angry]]
At the same time, only the last three students who were still persisting in their practice remained in the testing room. [[1245 旁白 neutral]]
Two of them had fewer errors, with very little out-of-control scattered mana, so they were still persisting. [[1246 旁白 neutral]]
The other pale-faced student surprised even the 'teacher': "This boy made quite a few mistakes during practice. He must be in unbearable pain all over his body right now, yet he can still persist until now?" [[1247 研究员 neutral]]
The assistant beside him asked: "Teacher, should we stop him?" [[1248 陌生男1 neutral]]
The 'teacher' shook his head with interest: "Since he wants to earn this money so badly, let's give him this chance." [[1249 研究员 neutral]]
"Besides, for our research, having one more complete set of error data on the cultivation route is obviously more beneficial." [[1250 研究员 neutral]]
... [[1251 旁白 neutral]]
In the testing room, whenever Zhang Yu wanted to give up, he felt that chill from the ritual's power and the countdown that arose in his mind. [[1252 旁白 neutral]]
"This stupid thing! All it knows is to nag. If you're so capable, you do it." [[1253 张羽 angry]]
During the practice process, whenever Zhang Yu made a slight mistake, he could feel mana going out of control and overflowing from the route, staying in various parts of his body and stimulating him until his whole body was sore and itchy, hot and cold. [[1254 旁白 neutral]]
After finally completing the entire cultivation route once, he glanced at the Feather Book and saw "Celestial Cycle Qi Gathering Method Level 0 (0/1)" had changed to "Celestial Cycle Qi Gathering Method Level 1 (0/20)". Only then did he feel slightly relieved. [[1255 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu admitted he had been gambling, but fortunately this time the gamble paid off. [[1256 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, memories of practicing this technique hundreds and thousands of times flooded out from his mind, making him feel as if he had been practicing this technique for months. [[1257 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Zhang Yu felt that if he wanted to, he could use the Celestial Cycle Qi Gathering Method to gather all the out-of-control mana in his body and establish a complex mana circulation system. [[1258 旁白 neutral]]
However, he didn't do so immediately. Instead, he endured the soreness and itching all over his body and slowly stood up. [[1259 旁白 neutral]]
The instructor beside him hurried over, also somewhat surprised: "Student, are you alright?" [[1260 面试官 neutral]]
This was the first time he had seen someone persist to the end with such a high error rate. [[1261 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu clutched his stomach and said: "I feel like my insides are burning, itchy and painful. The upper half of my body feels like it's on fire, and the lower half feels frozen... It's so uncomfortable." [[1262 张羽 sad]]
The instructor hurried to support him: "Let me take you to the medical office for a checkup first." [[1263 面试官 neutral]]
"No need!" Zhang Yu waved his hand forcefully and said: "I mean... you need to pay more." [[1264 张羽 neutral]]
The instructor looked him up and down, seeing Zhang Yu constantly trembling and his increasingly pale face, and said: "One thousand yuan, sign another contract, and whatever happens to you next has nothing to do with us." [[1265 面试官 neutral]]
After some haggling, Xianyun Company finally raised the payment by 3,000 yuan for Zhang Yu, requiring that no matter what his injuries were afterward, they would have no relationship with Xianyun Company. [[1266 旁白 neutral]]
