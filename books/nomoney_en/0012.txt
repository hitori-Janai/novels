Chapter 12: Vigorous Progress [[1268 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, Zhang Yu emerged from the Xianyun Group office building, his face pale and his body hunched over in a state of weakness. [[1269 旁白 neutral]]
However, a few kilometers after leaving the skyscraper and boarding the subway, his complexion gradually began to return to normal. [[1270 旁白 neutral]]
As he began to circulate the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique, the mana in his body surged forward like countless small streams, instantly permeating all his flesh and blood. [[1271 旁白 neutral]]
The once out-of-control mana that had been scattering was now guided back into place by the surging streams, merging into the complex circulatory system within him and flowing endlessly on its own. [[1272 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique Level 1 (0/20) [[1273 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the technique that appeared on the Feather Book, a slight smile touched Zhang Yu's lips. [[1274 张羽 happy]]
"I knew I could master it." [[1275 张羽 happy]]
"If I hadn't mastered the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique, it would have taken one or two weeks for this rampant mana to dissipate." [[1276 张羽 neutral]]
The reason Zhang Yu dared to accept the technique-testing job was because of his confidence in the Feather Book. [[1277 旁白 neutral]]
However, back at the Xianyun Group, he had not revealed his ability to master the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1278 旁白 neutral]]
"Although this is just a basic breathing technique for beginners, once you master it, it runs automatically, 24 hours a day." [[1279 张羽 neutral]]
"Even without actively practicing, it still operates at thirty percent of the efficiency. After mastering it... even if I do nothing all day, it's like practicing for more than seven hours." [[1280 张羽 neutral]]
"And that's just the effect at Level 1." [[1281 张羽 neutral]]
"If this technique is successfully developed, it would probably become one of the best-selling breathing techniques on the market." [[1282 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu knew that, apart from the techniques taught in school, the techniques from major corporations and sects were all protected by copyright and had to be purchased, representing immense profits. [[1283 旁白 neutral]]
It was precisely because this Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique was so powerful that Zhang Yu saw it as a critical development project for the Xianyun Group. He was unwilling to reveal that he had mastered it, to avoid complications. [[1284 旁白 neutral]]
Moreover, the technique was incredibly difficult to learn. In Zhang Yu's opinion, a first-year high school student could never master it without the aid of the guidance equipment, let alone circulate it completely even once. [[1285 旁白 neutral]]
This made him even more reluctant to reveal that he had mastered the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1286 旁白 neutral]]
And in order to master the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique, Zhang Yu had switched the Feather Book's specialization from the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms to this breathing technique. [[1287 旁白 neutral]]
Although this meant he couldn't quickly advance the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms for now, the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique was now on the fast track. [[1288 旁白 neutral]]
"Level 3 of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms is enough for now." [[1289 张羽 neutral]]
"From now on, I'll focus on improving this Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique." [[1290 张羽 neutral]]
Besides the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique, the biggest reward from this trial was the payment from the Xianyun Group. [[1291 旁白 neutral]]
Ten thousand yuan, plus an additional three thousand, for a total of 13,000. [[1292 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's savings suddenly jumped to thirteen thousand seven hundred yuan. [[1293 旁白 happy]]
Unfortunately, after he used ten thousand to repay loans on multiple platforms, his savings instantly dropped to three thousand seven hundred. [[1294 旁白 sad]]
However, after repaying the ten thousand, the collection calls became much less frequent. They probably wouldn't escalate their methods anytime soon. [[1295 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the countdown in his mind interrupted his thoughts, forcing him to focus again on circulating the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1296 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1297 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, the night passed. [[1298 旁白 neutral]]
At the entrance of Songyang High School, Zhang Yu was walking while checking the changes in the Feather Book. [[1299 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique Level 1 (0/20) → Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique Level 1 (11/20) [[1300 旁白 neutral]]
His mana had also increased, thanks to his previous hard work and the recent practice of the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1301 旁白 neutral]]
Mana 7.7 → [[1302 旁白 neutral]]
"It really is running passively. Last night before bed, I only circulated it five times." [[1303 张羽 happy]]
"But when I woke up this morning, it had increased to eight times. On the way to school, I actively circulated it, and it increased to eleven." [[1304 张羽 happy]]
Zhang Yu was secretly pleased with his calculation. Compared to the thirteen thousand yuan, the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique was yesterday's greatest reward. [[1305 旁白 happy]]
He resolved to raise the level of this Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique first. [[1306 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, he also decided to keep the Feather Book's specialization on the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1307 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, this morning there were two consecutive PE classes. [[1308 旁白 neutral]]
Walking toward the training ground, Zhang Yu felt a bit regretful. [[1309 旁白 sad]]
"Sigh, I have to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms again." [[1310 张羽 sad]]
"My specialization is the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique now. It's the best time for me to practice this breathing method." [[1311 张羽 sad]]
As soon as Zhang Yu entered the training ground, he saw little giants with muscles bulging like marble, sticking needles into their own bodies. [[1312 旁白 neutral]]
Accompanied by popping sounds, beast-like roars, and the clash of equipment, the students of the demonstration class were already training with great enthusiasm. [[1313 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a student looked at Wang Hai in shock: "No... impossible, my cousin sold this to me..." [[1314 陌生男1 angry]]
Wang Hai shook his head, crushing the syringe in his hand into powder with a snap and tossing it into the trash. [[1315 王海 angry]]
"Look at your weight change these past two weeks. No signs of growth in muscle or organs. Your physical strength only increased by 0.03 in two weeks. It's a classic case of natural training decline. You obviously bought fake drugs." [[1316 王海 angry]]
At this point, he stopped looking at the devastated student and raised his voice, "How many times have I told you all? You must buy drugs through proper channels. The safest is definitely the supply from the school's teachers." [[1317 王海 angry]]
"If you try to save a little money and buy fake or expired drugs, you're being penny-wise and pound-foolish. You're wasting your own time." [[1318 王海 angry]]
After scolding the student, Wang Hai's gaze swept over to Zhang Yu, who was training in the corner. [[1319 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at Zhang Yu, Wang Hai recalled the physical strength data from today's test: "0.85? A 0.02 increase in physical strength in three days?" [[1320 王海 neutral]]
"Wasn't Zhang Yu this fast even when he was taking drugs every day?" [[1321 王海 neutral]]
From Wang Hai's years of teaching experience, such a rapid increase in physical strength meant Zhang Yu couldn't possibly be training naturally without drugs or injections as he claimed. He must have secretly taken something before class. [[1322 旁白 neutral]]
"Not only is he not training naturally, but the drugs he's taking must be very potent to achieve this effect. The damage to his body is probably also significant." [[1323 王海 neutral]]
As for Zhang Yu reaching the third level of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms and undergoing extreme demonic training on his own, Wang Hai never even considered it. [[1324 旁白 neutral]]
But no matter what, Zhang Yu was now increasingly challenging his authority in the classroom. [[1325 旁白 angry]]
A key question was, where did Zhang Yu get his drugs? [[1326 旁白 neutral]]
Would other students see Zhang Yu's results and try to buy from the same source? [[1327 旁白 neutral]]
If that happened, wouldn't it affect his sales performance? [[1328 旁白 angry]]
The thought of the bloody competition in the physical enhancement drug market instantly put Wang Hai on high alert. [[1329 旁白 angry]]
"A second-year? A third-year teacher?" [[1330 王海 neutral]]
"Or did a tutor from outside of school guide him?" [[1331 王海 neutral]]
"Is someone trying to sell on my turf?" [[1332 王海 angry]]
To Wang Hai, Zhang Yu himself was just a pawn. What he wanted to figure out now was the person behind Zhang Yu. [[1333 旁白 neutral]]
However, the influence in the class had to be eliminated. [[1334 旁白 neutral]]
So, a moment later, Wang Hai gave a few instructions to a student named Zhao Tianxing. [[1335 旁白 neutral]]
Then Zhao Tianxing walked over to Zhang Yu and said, "Zhang Yu, Teacher Wang asked me to check if you're sure you won't be buying any more drugs." [[1336 赵天行 neutral]]
After seeing Zhang Yu nod, Zhao Tianxing scratched his head and said embarrassedly, "Well... the teacher told me to tell you, to avoid disturbing others' training, he wants you to practice alone in the small room next door. Is that okay?" [[1337 赵天行 neutral]]
After being instructed by Wang Hai, Zhao Tianxing understood that Wang Hai intended to further isolate Zhang Yu. [[1338 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at Zhang Yu with a trace of pity, but his actions didn't hesitate in the slightest. [[1339 旁白 neutral]]
As one of Wang Hai's "good students," Zhao Tianxing had followed all of Wang Hai's guidance, purchased all the recommended drugs, and through his own effort, had broken through the 1.00 physical strength level, becoming one of the top ten strongest students in the class. [[1340 旁白 neutral]]
So, he always did as the PE teacher, Wang Hai, told him. [[1341 旁白 neutral]]
However, worried that Zhang Yu might get upset, he spoke very politely and added, "Why don't you just buy some drugs? Teacher Wang's drugs are really good quality. Natural training really doesn't work..." [[1342 赵天行 neutral]]
But to Zhao Tianxing's surprise, Zhang Yu agreed to go out and train without any hesitation. [[1343 旁白 neutral]]
Watching him leave, Zhao Tianxing scratched his head and thought to himself, "Sigh, Zhang Yu is a bit stubborn. Can't he just apologize to the teacher, admit his mistake, and continue with class? He's ruining his own future by being so impulsive." [[1344 赵天行 sad]]
Meanwhile, Zhang Yu entered the small room, chuckled, sat down, and immediately began practicing the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1345 旁白 neutral]]
Strands of spiritual energy flowed into his Dantian's sea of qi, where he refined them drop by drop into mana. [[1346 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique Level 1 (11/20) → Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique Level 1 (16/20) [[1347 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, five circulations were completed, and the two PE classes were over. [[1348 旁白 neutral]]
But during the following Chinese and Math classes, Zhang Yu remained in the classroom, completely focused on circulating the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1349 旁白 neutral]]
Breathing in spiritual energy and refining mana for a long time was naturally a very boring task. [[1350 旁白 neutral]]
His waist, abdomen, and shoulders would ache, his skin would itch, and his mind would feel dull. [[1351 旁白 neutral]]
Even the old Zhang Yu would often need to relax after an hour or two of practice, standing up to walk around, or scratching his itches. [[1352 旁白 neutral]]
But now, forced by the ritual's power and encouraged by the numbers changing in the Feather Book, Zhang Yu pushed through and finally completed the 20th repetition of the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1353 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique Level 2 (0/40) [[1354 旁白 happy]]
Countless experiences of circulating the technique bloomed in Zhang Yu's mind. He could feel the mana circulation in his body become more complex, more refined, and more powerful. [[1355 旁白 happy]]
When Zhang Yu stopped, the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique continued to operate, but at a slightly faster speed than before. [[1356 旁白 neutral]]
"At Level 1, the passive breathing speed is only thirty percent of the active speed." [[1357 张羽 neutral]]
"But at Level 2, the passive breathing speed has increased to thirty-five percent of the active speed." [[1358 张羽 happy]]
"As for actively circulating the technique, the efficiency has also improved a lot. It's so much stronger than my original Level 1 basic breathing technique." [[1359 张羽 happy]]
Zhang Yu nodded slightly, somewhat satisfied. This was a continuous, day-and-night improvement. [[1360 旁白 happy]]
So, after lunch, he redoubled his efforts, continuing to improve the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1361 旁白 neutral]]
In the following days, he invested almost all his available time into the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1362 旁白 neutral]]
The path of cultivation in high school was both boring and arduous. Especially since Zhang Yu had no time to relax under the pressure of the ritual. Only by watching the numbers after the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique slowly increase, and imagining the long-term benefits of its passive effect, could his spirit feel a little more at ease. [[1363 旁白 neutral]]
As they say, if you can't fight it, you might as well enjoy it. [[1364 旁白 neutral]]
So, during PE class, he was cultivating the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1365 旁白 neutral]]
During Chinese class, he was cultivating the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1366 旁白 neutral]]
During his lunch break, he was still cultivating the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1367 旁白 neutral]]
At night, while waiting for work in the square, he was still cultivating the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique. Unfortunately, he didn't find any work for three days. [[1368 旁白 sad]]
As for sleeping at home, needless to say, the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique was still operating on its own. [[1369 旁白 neutral]]
In just three short days, the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique was raised to Level 4 (5/80). [[1370 旁白 happy]]
His mana also progressed vigorously with his hard work, increasing from 7.8 to 8.3. [[1371 旁白 happy]]
Now, the passive breathing speed of the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Technique had reached forty-five percent of the active breathing speed. [[1372 旁白 happy]]
