Chapter 19: Terror and the Dao Heart [[1913 旁白 neutral]]
"645... 644... 639..." [[1914 钱深 anxious]]
One by one, the figures of his classmates appeared before Qian Shen. He couldn't see them clearly, but he could plainly see the scores displayed above their heads. [[1915 旁白 neutral]]
"680, 690, 660..." [[1916 钱深 anxious]]
The score displayed above each person's head was unattainably high, sparkling so brightly that Qian Shen felt ashamed of himself. [[1917 旁白 sad]]
He felt that standing before his classmates, he was so inadequate, as lowly as a henchman. [[1918 旁白 sad]]
"Standing among these people, I'm like a bag of wet trash." [[1919 钱深 sad]]
"With a mere score of over 600, I don't deserve to be here, let alone talk to them or even get close to them..." [[1920 钱深 sad]]
In his eyes, the scores on his classmates' heads kept rising, and their figures grew taller with them, like giants towering into the clouds. Soon, he could only see their legs and couldn't even make out their faces. [[1921 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1922 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, on the other side of the art exhibition, a drone from Mangshan High School's Li Xingyu traced a path through the air, flying slowly toward the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram. [[1923 旁白 neutral]]
But the next moment, with a crackle, the drone seemed to malfunction and fell crookedly to the ground. [[1924 旁白 neutral]]
"The soul cultivation students from Mangshan High are all tied up in contracts. They shouldn't bother joining the fun." [[1925 李雪莲 neutral]]
Li Xuelian murmured softly, then looked away from the drone and continued to observe the other students. [[1926 旁白 neutral]]
"It's a pity. The students trying their luck at this exhibition are almost all first-years. To master the martial arts in the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram, second and third-year students would have a better chance." [[1927 李雪莲 neutral]]
"But it's understandable... The top students in the second and third years either don't meet the age requirement or are already bound by contracts, so they wouldn't be looking for a new master." [[1928 李雪莲 neutral]]
Just then, the brilliantly shining director of the Xianyun Group in Songyang City approached Li Xuelian, smiling. "This Celestial Martial Arts Diagram, personally drawn by Master Starfire, is truly miraculous. What exactly is it testing?" [[1929 仙韵集团嵩阳市总监 neutral]]
Li Xuelian didn't answer his question directly. Instead, she said lightly, "The first trial of the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram tests the Dao Heart." [[1930 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Those who can't withstand it are often forced to retreat, and it can even leave a flaw in their Dao Heart." [[1931 李雪莲 neutral]]
... [[1932 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling the countless scornful and mocking gazes from all around, Zhao Tianxing couldn't help but step back again and again, moving away from the area of effect of the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram. [[1933 旁白 neutral]]
When he came back to his senses and saw the situation around him, he finally understood that the feeling of being watched and despised by everyone was just an effect of the diagram. [[1934 旁白 neutral]]
Realizing he had failed the test of the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram, his face flushed red with shame. He quickly retreated, afraid that someone might see him, a security guard, making a fool of himself. [[1935 旁白 sad]]
... [[1936 旁白 neutral]]
At the exhibition, Li Xuelian continued, "If one can pass this first trial, it has the effect of tempering the Dao Heart." [[1937 李雪莲 neutral]]
"When it comes to the level of the Dao Heart, most of us cultivators rely on mind-techniques to improve it." [[1938 李雪莲 neutral]]
"And different mind-techniques require different ways of thinking to be compatible." [[1939 李雪莲 neutral]]
"For example, with the ancient God-Worshipping Mind-Technique, the cultivator must be incredibly devout and have absolute faith in the deity. The more pious they are, the better the technique works." [[1940 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Or take the Tianqin Mind-Technique from Ziyun High School. It requires the cultivator to practice to the extreme, making hard work an instinct to achieve the greatest effect." [[1941 李雪莲 neutral]]
"And the Basic Heart-Refining Method for high school students requires a calm and focused mind, paired with patient and persistent effort." [[1942 李雪莲 neutral]]
"There are thousands of mind-techniques to improve the Dao Heart, some high-level, some low-level, but the key is whether the cultivator's thinking aligns with the technique." [[1943 李雪莲 neutral]]
"But a person's thoughts are hard to measure. How someone truly thinks, whether they are really compatible with a mind-technique... forget outsiders, sometimes even they themselves can't say for sure." [[1944 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Fortunately, the stronger the Dao Heart, the stronger a person's willpower. So, measuring the Dao Heart level by willpower has become the simplest way to test the effectiveness of a mind-technique." [[1945 李雪莲 neutral]]
"But the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram doesn't just measure the strength of the Dao Heart by testing willpower." [[1946 李雪莲 neutral]]
"The diagram targets the terror in one's heart. It directly strikes at the weaknesses of the mind, giving them no chance to resist with mind-techniques. It tests their most primal reaction." [[1947 李雪莲 neutral]]
"When faced with their own mental weaknesses, only by adjusting their thinking in time can they overcome them and pass the trial." [[1948 李雪莲 neutral]]
The director of the Xianyun Group's eyes lit up. "I understand. Master Starfire wants a disciple with a flexible mind? Someone who, when practicing the God-Worshipping Mind-Technique, can switch gods, and when practicing the Tianqin Mind-Technique, can compete in both hard work and in lying flat." [[1949 仙韵集团嵩阳市总监 neutral]]
Li Xuelian nodded. "There are countless mind-techniques, and it's good if one's thinking is compatible. But only those who can constantly adjust their thinking to adapt to changing environments and techniques are the true geniuses, not bound by the techniques themselves." [[1950 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Especially now, as times are changing faster and faster, the Ten Great Sects influence all aspects of society, and the entire Kunxu is undergoing drastic changes. It's not acceptable if your thinking can't adapt in time." [[1951 李雪莲 neutral]]
"For instance, in this day and age, exams and scores are essential to walk the path of cultivation. They have long been integrated into every cultivator's life." [[1952 李雪莲 neutral]]
"So, modern cultivators naturally have a fixation on exams and scores." [[1953 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Having excellent scores, and the obsession with them, can make a top student's will firm, which makes it easier to raise their Dao Heart level." [[1954 李雪莲 neutral]]
"But this is also a mental weakness. There is always someone better. A temporary lead doesn't mean a permanent one. Many top students are as confident when they are at the top as they are insecure when they fall behind." [[1955 李雪莲 neutral]]
"To overcome this mental weakness, a cultivator needs to be flexible in their thinking. This is the key to passing the trial." [[1956 李雪莲 neutral]]
"For example, a student once repeatedly experienced getting low scores in the diagram's test. He eventually overcame his fear of low scores and developed a 'delusional mindset'." [[1957 李雪莲 neutral]]
... [[1958 旁白 neutral]]
Listening to the teacher announce the results from the podium, Lian Tianji suddenly burst out laughing. "Hahaha, since I've already become the last-place loser, I'll just start over from the bottom." [[1959 炼天极 happy]]
"From this day on, I am the worst, the student with the lowest score." [[1960 炼天极 happy]]
"But even as a failure, I have the chance to surpass you all, one by one, and take the top spot." [[1961 炼天极 happy]]
"I will definitely become number one in the grade!" [[1962 炼天极 happy]]
As he conquered the terror in his heart, he felt as if he had returned to the art exhibition, and the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram before him became clearer. [[1963 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1964 旁白 neutral]]
Li Xuelian continued, "Kunxu has 36 floors above ground and 18 below. Each floor is a different world. Whether they are humans or immortals, they are all divided into ranks. This ranking is ingrained in the bones of every cultivator, influencing the depths of their thoughts." [[1965 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Previously, there was a student who was crushed by layers of pressure from countless people in the diagram's trial, and eventually developed a 'lying-flat mindset'." [[1966 李雪莲 neutral]]
... [[1967 旁白 neutral]]
Qian Shen watched as the giants, whose scores far surpassed his, rose from the ground, growing taller and taller until their faces became a blur. [[1968 旁白 anxious]]
Only the ever-increasing, glowing scores on the giants' heads were still visible. [[1969 旁白 anxious]]
He tried to keep up with them, but it was useless. [[1970 旁白 sad]]
As the giants grew to more and more exaggerated heights and their scores continued to climb, his mood shifted from tense to afraid, then from afraid to desperate, and finally, it turned into a kind of numbness. [[1971 旁白 sad]]
He lay down on the ground, no longer looking at the figures of the giants. [[1972 旁白 neutral]]
"Fine." [[1973 钱深 neutral]]
"I just won't chase them anymore." [[1974 钱深 neutral]]
"I just need to be able to cultivate myself. Even if I can't compare to anyone... as long as I can cultivate, it's fine." [[1975 钱深 neutral]]
As if waking from a long dream, Qian Shen, lying on the ground, opened his eyes. He looked at the art exhibition and the martial arts diagram before him with a look of understanding. [[1976 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1977 旁白 neutral]]
In the exhibition hall, the Songyang City director of the Xianyun Group listened to Li Xuelian's analysis and agreed, "Changes in thinking are inseparable from the influence of the times." [[1978 仙韵集团嵩阳市总监 neutral]]
He guessed, "In today's society, everyone relies on loans. I suppose this is also reflected in the trial of the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram?" [[1979 仙韵集团嵩阳市总监 neutral]]
"Correct." Li Xuelian nodded. "There was once a student who faced the terror of repaying his cultivation debts in the diagram's test, and in the end, developed a 'deadbeat mindset'." [[1980 李雪莲 neutral]]
... [[1981 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the debt-collecting thunderclouds gathering in the sky, Bai Zhenzhen squatted down in terror. [[1982 旁白 anxious]]
"Wait! I'll pay it back!" [[1983 白真真 anxious]]
"I'll pay it back, okay!" [[1984 白真真 anxious]]
"Don't strike me!" [[1985 白真真 anxious]]
She quickly opened her phone to check her accounts, wanting to see how much she owed and how much she could repay. [[1986 旁白 anxious]]
"800,000?!" [[1987 白真真 sad]]
Opening the first lending platform, Bai Zhenzhen's heart sank. [[1988 旁白 anxious]]
Then the 1.2 million debt from the second platform made her break out in a cold sweat. [[1989 旁白 anxious]]
Two million... five million... eight million... [[1990 旁白 anxious]]
As the total debt she calculated in her mind grew, the hand holding the phone gradually dropped, limp. [[1991 旁白 sad]]
A total debt of eight million. For a high school student, such a huge amount would either lead to a complete breakdown or... [[1992 旁白 anxious]]
Bai Zhenzhen suddenly lay down on the ground and shouted at the thunder in the sky, "If you have the guts, then strike me down." [[1993 白真真 angry]]
"If you kill me, eight million will turn to dust." [[1994 白真真 angry]]
Seeing that the thunder was not striking, Bai Zhenzhen continued, "Either you kill me, and the eight million turns to dust." [[1995 白真真 angry]]
"Or you can help me find some work. I'll pay you back when I earn money." [[1996 白真真 neutral]]
As the thunderclouds gradually dispersed, the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram reappeared before Bai Zhenzhen. [[1997 旁白 neutral]]
And watching the martial arts being demonstrated within it, Bai Zhenzhen felt a sense of understanding. [[1998 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1999 旁白 neutral]]
At the exhibition, Li Xuelian sighed. "But whether it's a delusional, lying-flat, or deadbeat mindset, it's just a state of using one's thoughts to resist pressure. Although it can temper their will and Dao Heart, their future still depends on the path they take in reality." [[2000 李雪莲 neutral]]
"After all, this is just the first trial of the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram, just a threshold." [[2001 李雪莲 neutral]]
She remembered when she was in high school, her father had also tested her Dao Heart. [[2002 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, she was most afraid of her father. During the test, she was severely oppressed by him, and finally, under the immense pressure, she rose up in resistance, establishing an "Explosive Filial Piety mindset." After waking up, she fiercely exploited the old man for his resources, and her cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds. [[2003 旁白 neutral]]
But not long after, the pressures from all aspects of society, along with her father's actions, made her regain her admiration and respect for him. [[2004 旁白 neutral]]
The Xianyun Group director nodded slightly, knowing that Li Xuelian was right. The effect of such a Dao Heart test was only temporary. [[2005 旁白 neutral]]
After all, a person's thoughts are constantly changing. How could the impact of a mere test withstand the long-term influence of the entire society in the real world? [[2006 旁白 neutral]]
Li Xuelian continued, "After surviving the first trial and overcoming the terror in their hearts, the real comprehension comes next." [[2007 李雪莲 neutral]]
"And after passing the comprehension stage, whether they can ultimately master it is another matter entirely." [[2008 李雪莲 neutral]]
The director nodded, understanding that overcoming terror, comprehending the diagram, and mastering the martial art were the three stages of understanding the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram. [[2009 旁白 neutral]]
"Then looking at the people here, how many do you think can succeed?" [[2010 仙韵集团嵩阳市总监 neutral]]
Li Xuelian looked at the many students present and shook her head. "I'm afraid it would be hard to find even one." [[2011 李雪莲 sad]]
... [[2012 旁白 neutral]]
When Zhang Yu saw the figure in the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram gradually become clear and begin to practice a set of boxing forms, he suddenly felt a chill rise in his heart. [[2013 旁白 anxious]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill the wish, do not deliberately slack off or delay. 10." [[2014 邪神 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. "Wait... I'm trying hard to comprehend the martial arts diagram right now. Isn't that part of working hard to study and get into a good university?" [[2015 张羽 anxious]]
But the cold presence could not talk to him; it simply continued the countdown. [[2016 旁白 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill the wish, do not deliberately slack off or delay. 9." [[2017 邪神 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill the wish, do not deliberately slack off or delay. 8." [[2018 邪神 neutral]]
Having no choice, Zhang Yu could only sit down and try to practice breathing spiritual energy to see if he could stop the countdown. [[2019 旁白 neutral]]
As he began to practice, the cold feeling gradually dissipated, and the countdown stopped. [[2020 旁白 neutral]]
"This idiot..." [[2021 张羽 angry]]
Just as Zhang Yu was cursing the power of the ritual while practicing, another surging chill rose up inside him. [[2022 旁白 anxious]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill the wish, do not deliberately slack off or delay. 10." [[2023 邪神 neutral]]
Hearing this new countdown, Zhang Yu was shocked. [[2024 旁白 anxious]]
"Wait... I am cultivating hard." [[2025 张羽 anxious]]
"Why is it counting down again?" [[2026 张羽 anxious]]
"What's wrong with this idiotic ritual?" [[2027 张羽 angry]]
Zhang Yu decided to stop practicing to see what would happen. He found that the surging chill and the countdown did not disappear. Instead, another cold presence and a new countdown began. [[2028 旁白 anxious]]
Hearing two countdowns going off in his head, taking turns counting down, Zhang Yu finally understood what was happening. [[2029 旁白 neutral]]
"There are two countdowns?" [[2030 张羽 anxious]]
"Is one of them fake?" [[2031 张羽 anxious]]
