Chapter 21: Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining [[2124 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing these words, many students were startled, thinking that Bai Zhenzhen had succeeded. [[2125 旁白 neutral]]
But Li Xuelian sighed, looked at Bai Zhenzhen, and said, "To be able to learn the moves of these nine martial arts by yourself in such a short time, your talent is one in ten thousand." [[2126 李雪莲 neutral]]
"It's just a pity that you still fall a little short of my father's requirements." [[2127 李雪莲 sad]]
Hearing this, some of the students present breathed a sigh of relief, while others were secretly surprised. [[2128 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing thought to himself, "This still doesn't meet the requirements? Just how powerful of a disciple does this Master Xinghuo want?" [[2129 赵天行 neutral]]
On the other side, Bai Zhenzhen secretly breathed a sigh of relief. [[2130 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't expected to trigger the change in the Martial Arts Diagram so suddenly. She thought she had succeeded and, in a moment of panic, almost spoke up to refuse Master Xinghuo's offer. [[2131 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "Good thing I didn't say it, or I would have been so embarrassed. I knew something was missing." [[2132 白真真 neutral]]
After Bai Zhenzhen's attempt, others went up to try and practice the nine sets of martial arts, but no one could trigger a change in the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram again. [[2133 旁白 neutral]]
On the contrary, Lian Tianji, who had been overflowing with confidence, hesitated to go up and try again. He seemed to be pondering the reason for Bai Zhenzhen's failure, wondering what they were all missing. [[2134 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, the entire scene fell silent. Unconsciously, no one else went forward to try. [[2135 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Li Xuelian was thinking that this was the end of it, she saw Zhang Yu walk up with his phone. [[2136 旁白 neutral]]
"Hm?" Li Xuelian suddenly became interested, thinking to herself, "After seeing so many people fail, he still has the confidence to go up. It seems he's certain about something." [[2137 李雪莲 neutral]]
But the next moment, she couldn't help but frown. [[2138 旁白 neutral]]
Because Zhang Yu actually started playing a video on his phone, and began to practice the martial arts by copying Bai Zhenzhen's movements from the video. [[2139 旁白 neutral]]
Apparently, he had just recorded Bai Zhenzhen practicing the martial arts. [[2140 旁白 neutral]]
And seeing Zhang Yu copying the video, move for move, Li Xuelian's frown deepened. [[2141 旁白 neutral]]
It was clear that besides the fist technique he had understood himself, Zhang Yu was unfamiliar with the other eight martial arts. Although he was copying Bai Zhenzhen's movements from the video, it only highlighted the gap in their understanding of the techniques. [[2142 旁白 neutral]]
From a distance, Zhao Tianxing watched Zhang Yu in his security guard uniform, clumsily imitating Bai Zhenzhen's moves under everyone's gaze. He felt his skin crawl, so embarrassed that his toes could carve out a three-bedroom apartment. [[2143 旁白 neutral]]
Just by watching, he could feel the looks from the crowd seemed to be full of contempt and ridicule. He couldn't imagine how the person actually standing there, doing that, must feel. [[2144 旁白 neutral]]
"Stop it, Zhang Yu!" Zhao Tianxing couldn't bear to watch anymore and just shouted in his mind, "This is too embarrassing, you're being seen as a clown!" [[2145 赵天行 sad]]
Zhang Yu, of course, couldn't hear Zhao Tianxing's thoughts, nor did he care what the people in the art gallery thought of him now. [[2146 旁白 neutral]]
He just seriously practiced the nine martial arts, move by move, following Bai Zhenzhen's actions in the video. [[2147 旁白 neutral]]
As he finished the last move, countless experiences and feelings suddenly flooded his mind, giving Zhang Yu an instant, different understanding of the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram, as if he had practiced it tens of thousands of times. [[2148 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, the moves of the nine martial arts gradually faded from his mind, replaced by nine different intents faintly appearing. [[2149 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Zhang Yu suddenly understood that the nine martial arts on the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram were about intent, not moves. [[2150 旁白 neutral]]
What a cultivator had to do was to grasp the artistic conception within each move while practicing the martial arts. [[2151 旁白 neutral]]
The killing intent to break an army, the unyielding fighting spirit, the dauntless courage... The nine martial arts cultivated martial intent to strengthen one's Dao Heart. [[2152 旁白 neutral]]
"This isn't a martial art for combat or body refining, but one that uses martial intent to temper the Dao Heart." [[2153 张羽 neutral]]
This was a martial art technique used to raise the level of the Dao Heart! [[2154 旁白 neutral]]
Martial intent was the collective term used by the Ten Great Sects for the powers of sword intent, fist intent, saber intent, and so on. [[2155 旁白 neutral]]
The most basic function of martial intent was to strengthen the spirit and fortify one's will, thereby raising a cultivator's Dao Heart level. [[2156 旁白 neutral]]
And for a Golden Core Master like Master Xinghuo, their martial intent could even remain in a painting and influence the consciousness of others. [[2157 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, a strong change occurred in Zhang Yu's aura. [[2158 旁白 neutral]]
Killing intent, fighting spirit, courage, valor... A powerful aura emerged from his body, as if about to condense into his own martial intent at any moment. [[2159 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, the man in the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram became clearer and clearer, even gradually taking on vivid colors, as if turning into a real person, staring intently at the changes in Zhang Yu. [[2160 旁白 neutral]]
The people present who noticed this were also shocked; this was definitely the biggest reaction from the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram today. [[2161 旁白 neutral]]
Lian Tianji, Qian Shen, Bai Zhenzhen... all stared intently at Zhang Yu. They all felt the change in him, and the same unbelievable thought arose in their minds. [[2162 旁白 neutral]]
"Is he really going to succeed?" [[2163 旁白 neutral]]
But the next moment, the change in Zhang Yu was abruptly cut off, and the martial intent that seemed about to condense a moment ago dissipated completely. [[2164 旁白 neutral]]
"What a pity, what a pity." A sentence appeared on the painting: "A peerless talent, but one step short." [[2165 旁白 sad]]
There was no surprise on Zhang Yu's face. [[2166 旁白 neutral]]
Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art Level 0 (1/1, 8.3/8 Mana, 0.85/0.8 Physical Strength, 1/3 Dao Heart) [[2167 旁白 neutral]]
A martial art called the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art appeared in the Feather Book. [[2168 旁白 neutral]]
This was the martial art that appeared in the Feather Book after Zhang Yu repeatedly studied the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram, carefully watched the other students' performances, and recorded and reviewed Bai Zhenzhen's video. [[2169 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike the martial arts Zhang Yu had learned before, this Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art had requirements for mana, physical strength, and Dao Heart. [[2170 旁白 neutral]]
"Besides practicing all the moves like the fist, palm, and leg techniques, it also requires 8 mana, 0.8 physical strength, and a level 3 Dao Heart." [[2171 张羽 neutral]]
"I've met all the other requirements, except for the level 3 Dao Heart..." [[2172 张羽 sad]]
My own Dao Heart is only at level 1. [[2173 张羽 neutral]]
As expected, this attempt got stuck at the final step. [[2174 旁白 neutral]]
"This Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art seems to be a technique for after reaching Dao Heart level 3, used to condense martial intent and then use that to strengthen the will and temper the Dao Heart." [[2175 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought to himself, "A requirement of Dao Heart level 3 is so high. How could a first-year high school student who's only been in school for three months achieve that?" [[2176 张羽 neutral]]
Looking at the failed Zhang Yu, Li Xuelian's eyes were shining brightly. [[2177 旁白 happy]]
Her original plan flashed through her mind; she hadn't expected any of these first-year students to succeed in the first place. [[2178 旁白 neutral]]
"According to the information just sent from the security company, this person is Zhang Yu, a first-year student at Songyang High School." [[2179 李雪莲 neutral]]
"For this person to get this far, he can truly be called a peerless talent." [[2180 李雪莲 happy]]
Recalling Zhang Yu's performance just now, she thought with emotion, "Amazing, I almost misjudged him." [[2181 李雪莲 happy]]
"His moves looked stiff, and every punch and kick was awkward, yet he was able to grasp the intent within." [[2182 李雪莲 happy]]
"This means he values intent over form and saw the mystery of the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art early on." [[2183 李雪莲 happy]]
"Good, good, good. Father will have another great disciple under his wing." [[2184 李雪莲 happy]]
In fact, as soon as Li Xuelian had checked the background of the participants, she felt that no one would likely succeed in this test. [[2185 旁白 neutral]]
After all, students who could master the martial arts in the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram on the spot were either from prominent families or were already in their second or third year of high school and had already been signed to contracts. It was unlikely they would come to become Master Xinghuo's disciple. [[2186 旁白 neutral]]
The possibility of finding a genius who could master the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art on the spot was extremely small. [[2187 旁白 neutral]]
But that didn't mean no one could become her father's disciple. [[2188 旁白 neutral]]
If any of the first-year students present could withstand the impact of the martial intent, learn all the moves on the spot, and comprehend the mystery of the martial intent from them, then even if they couldn't master it in the end, they were definitely a genius of outstanding talent. [[2189 旁白 neutral]]
If such a person came a year later, they would certainly be able to master the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art and would also meet her father's requirements. Now, it was like finding them a year early, before they had fully developed and signed a contract. [[2190 旁白 neutral]]
She believed her father would definitely be willing to accept such an excellent disciple. [[2191 旁白 happy]]
In that case, the fact that this first-year student couldn't master the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art wouldn't be a drawback. Instead, it would be more beneficial for Li Xuelian to press the price down a bit when negotiating the contract. [[2192 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, she was already smiling at Zhang Yu. [[2193 旁白 happy]]
"Young man, although you didn't truly master the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art, you have already understood its mystery. Mastering this martial art is only a matter of time for you." [[2194 李雪莲 happy]]
"I will ask my father in a moment to see if he is willing to accept you as his disciple." [[2195 李雪莲 happy]]
Hearing this, the crowd was once again in shock. [[2196 旁白 neutral]]
Lian Tianji looked towards Zhang Yu and secretly took a photo of him with his phone. He wanted to ask someone to find out who this powerful security guard was that had appeared out of nowhere. [[2197 旁白 neutral]]
Qian Shen looked at Zhang Yu in disbelief, shouting wildly in his mind, "Impossible! How could a person with a score of 550 be accepted as a disciple by a Golden Core Master? I must be dreaming. Is the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram still testing me!" [[2198 钱深 angry]]
Bai Zhenzhen: "Is Yu... cheating?" [[2199 白真真 neutral]]
Discovering that his good friend, who used to be inferior to him in every way and was in debt with him, had suddenly soared, Bai Zhenzhen felt very uncomfortable. [[2200 旁白 neutral]]
Yu, it's not that I don't wish you well. If you got into the top ten or top five in the grade, higher than before but lower than me, I would definitely congratulate you. [[2201 白真真 sad]]
But you had to surpass everyone, including me. [[2202 白真真 sad]]
However, seeing the people around him trying to get close to Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "After Zhang Yu signs with a Golden Core Master, he'll definitely be able to get a lot of investment. I have to fleece him for all he's worth and borrow money from him." [[2203 白真真 happy]]
But the next moment, another thought occurred to her, and she frowned: "But half of this Golden Core Master's cultivation was taken away, and he was laid off by a major sect. He has no resources and no background. If Zhang Yu really becomes his disciple, he'll be a workhorse for life." [[2204 白真真 sad]]
"Never mind, never mind. We're brothers. I should still remind him not to be blinded by the words 'Golden Core' and tell him to refuse the offer." [[2205 白真真 neutral]]
On the other side, Zhao Tianxing's eyes widened, his mind a complete blank. But soon he remembered how he had tried to persuade Zhang Yu, and he felt a wave of embarrassment, "So embarrassing." [[2206 赵天行 sad]]
"He's a real genius, and when I was saying those things to him, he must have thought I was a clown." [[2207 赵天行 sad]]
Just as Bai Zhenzhen was walking towards Zhang Yu, many other students also gathered around. [[2208 旁白 neutral]]
Some wanted to add Zhang Yu's contact information, some wanted to ask him about the mysteries of the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Diagram, and others wanted to take a photo with him. [[2209 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Li Xuelian had already stepped aside to call her father. [[2210 旁白 neutral]]
"Dad, I've found a good prospect here in Songyang City..." [[2211 李雪莲 happy]]
