Chapter 22: The Contract [[2213 旁白 neutral]]
After Li Xuelian explained Zhang Yu's situation, a soft laugh came from the other end of the phone. [[2214 旁白 neutral]]
"He is indeed good, but there's no need to accept him." [[2215 星火真人 neutral]]
Li Xuelian asked in confusion, "Why?" [[2216 李雪莲 neutral]]
Master Xinghuo laughed heartily, his voice full of joy, "I've already found a true genius." [[2217 星火真人 happy]]
"Also a first-year high school student, only 15 years old, and he mastered the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art in just half an hour." [[2218 星火真人 happy]]
"And he doesn't have any contracts." [[2219 星火真人 happy]]
At this point, Master Xinghuo couldn't help but laugh out loud again. [[2220 旁白 neutral]]
Li Xuelian said in surprise, "There's such a prodigy?" [[2221 李雪莲 neutral]]
Master Xinghuo chuckled, "I told you before, the first layer of Kunxu never lacks geniuses, only people to invest in them." [[2222 星火真人 neutral]]
"You know how brilliant the top scorers in each subject of the college entrance exam are, as well as the overall top scorer." [[2223 星火真人 neutral]]
"But there are many such geniuses on the first layer of Kunxu every year, and another group not far behind them, popping up year after year like leeks that can't all be harvested." [[2224 星火真人 neutral]]
"There are too many geniuses. It's just that I couldn't find them in the past and was always beaten to it by others. But now, I've finally found one first." [[2225 星火真人 happy]]
Li Xuelian glanced in Zhang Yu's direction with some regret and asked, "Shouldn't we sign this Zhang Yu as well?" [[2226 李雪莲 neutral]]
Master Xinghuo: "Forget it. From now on, our family's resources will be invested in the true genius. Let's not divide our attention." [[2227 星火真人 neutral]]
... [[2228 旁白 neutral]]
In a meeting room next to the art exhibition. [[2229 旁白 neutral]]
Li Xuelian looked at Zhang Yu with an apologetic expression and said, "I'm sorry, student. My father has other urgent matters to attend to and probably won't be able to take you as a disciple for now." [[2230 李雪莲 neutral]]
She said sincerely, "However, you can use the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art freely from now on. I'll give you the usage rights as a gift." [[2231 李雪莲 neutral]]
Li Xuelian looked at Zhang Yu with admiration in her eyes, "Finally, I'd like to give you ten thousand yuan in my own name." [[2232 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Don't be in a hurry to refuse. This gift is purely out of my appreciation for your talent." [[2233 李雪莲 neutral]]
"I hope that by the time we meet again, you will have been admitted to a prestigious university." [[2234 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Oh, right, about those videos you recorded, they also involve the distribution rights of the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art. You'll need to delete them..." [[2235 李雪莲 neutral]]
A moment later, watching Zhang Yu's departing figure, the smile on Li Xuelian's face gradually faded. [[2236 旁白 neutral]]
Although Master Xinghuo had no intention of taking him as a disciple, Li Xuelian didn't want to make an enemy of such a talented young man. [[2237 旁白 neutral]]
After all, giving away the usage rights to the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art and ten thousand yuan was a small matter for her. [[2238 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't even remember how many times she had given such small, casual gifts to young geniuses. [[2239 旁白 neutral]]
However, the vast majority of them eventually faded into obscurity and were long forgotten by her. [[2240 旁白 neutral]]
After settling this matter, Li Xuelian went to meet a few more important guests, and then she couldn't wait to find her father. [[2241 旁白 neutral]]
She was extremely curious about the peerless genius Master Xinghuo had mentioned. [[2242 旁白 neutral]]
... [[2243 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, at the art exhibition that had not yet officially ended. [[2244 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu, who had just come out of the meeting room, and asked, "How did it go? Did you reject Master Xinghuo? Li Xuelian didn't give you a hard time, did she?" [[2245 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu recalled Li Xuelian's admiring expression and shook his head, "She didn't give me a hard time." [[2246 张羽 neutral]]
"Before I could even speak, she rejected me, saying Master Xinghuo had other important matters..." [[2247 张羽 neutral]]
"But she did give me an extra 10,000 yuan at the end." [[2248 张羽 neutral]]
Hearing Zhang Yu's words, Bai Zhenzhen curled her lip, "A standard excuse." [[2249 白真真 neutral]]
"Maybe she checked your background and found out you're not that outstanding after all." [[2250 白真真 neutral]]
"For example, your monthly test scores are too low, you have no sterilization record, your muscles aren't well-developed, and you're deep in debt..." [[2251 白真真 neutral]]
Listening to Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu pursed his lips, "A-Zhen, you lost and you're still not convinced, so now you're resorting to personal attacks, huh?" [[2252 张羽 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu's smug look, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but grab his shoulder and demand, "Are you going to tell me what kind of cheat you used or not?" [[2253 白真真 angry]]
"Tell me now, did you borrow money to bribe the staff and study the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram in advance?!" [[2254 白真真 angry]]
Looking at Bai Zhenzhen's ugly, jealous expression, Zhang Yu chuckled. [[2255 旁白 neutral]]
Go on, A-Zhen. Watching the pathetic state of you losers after your defeat is my current pleasure. [[2256 张羽 neutral]]
Just as the two were talking, Qian Shen walked over from not far away. [[2257 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at Zhang Yu with a serious expression and asked, "Do you intentionally do poorly on your usual exams?" [[2258 钱深 neutral]]
The trial of the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram had increased Qian Shen's resistance to high-scorers. [[2259 旁白 neutral]]
But he was utterly shocked that a low-scorer could outperform him. [[2260 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu shake his head in denial, Qian Shen said, unwilling to accept it, "Impossible! If you didn't do it on purpose, why is there such a mismatch between your talent and your scores?" [[2261 钱深 angry]]
"Hmm?" Zhang Yu thought for a moment and said, "Exams can't possibly show a person's full potential..." [[2262 张羽 neutral]]
But Qian Shen cut him off, saying excitedly, "Impossible!" [[2263 钱深 angry]]
"The college entrance exam and the six major high school courses were designed by the Ten Great Sects. It's a system for evaluating high school students, verified and adjusted by countless experts and powerful individuals. It's the most optimal, scientific, and cultivation-oriented system for evaluating a person!" [[2264 钱深 angry]]
"Every subject, every point, perfectly reflects the all-encompassing gap between people, including the superiority and inferiority of bloodlines, regional backwardness, and incomplete evolution..." [[2265 钱深 angry]]
Looking at Qian Shen's incredibly serious expression, Zhang Yu realized he had misjudged him before. [[2266 旁白 neutral]]
This guy isn't just a score-discriminator, he's evolved from score-discrimination to bloodline, regional, and even racial discrimination. He's become a supporter of a score-based caste system. [[2267 张羽 neutral]]
In short, in Qian Shen's view, a high score means you're awesome, an elite, and you have the right to feel superior and confident, while a low score means you're trash. [[2268 旁白 neutral]]
This was the worldview he had built over many years, the source of his confidence as a top student, and it could even be said to be the rule in all key high schools. [[2269 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmph, forget it if you don't want to admit it." [[2270 钱深 angry]]
"But I will report the situation here to the school. I hope you'll show your true abilities in the next monthly exam and not get an 'incompletely evolved' score like 550 again." [[2271 钱深 angry]]
Watching Qian Shen walk away, Zhang Yu felt as if he had been insulted, but also as if he hadn't. [[2272 旁白 neutral]]
Beside him, Bai Zhenzhen nodded thoughtfully, "Out of all that nonsense he said, there's one thing you do need to pay attention to." [[2273 白真真 neutral]]
"The school will definitely find out what happened here, and they might try to sign a contract with you." [[2274 白真真 neutral]]
"A contract?" Zhang Yu looked at A-Zhen curiously. He had vaguely heard about it before, but he didn't know the details. [[2275 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen explained, "As you know, not everyone in high school is as rich as Qian Shen's family." [[2276 白真真 neutral]]
"For many students who are poor but have good grades and talent, they need someone to invest in them." [[2277 白真真 neutral]]
"And the school itself is one of the investors." [[2278 白真真 neutral]]
"Usually, after the second year of high school begins, they select a group of outstanding students based on their performance and grades in the first year and sign contracts with them, investing money in them." [[2279 白真真 neutral]]
"Of course, there are a very small number of students who are so outstanding, so dazzling, that the school will discuss contracts with them during their first year to prevent others from signing them first." [[2280 白真真 neutral]]
Speaking of which, Bai Zhenzhen puffed out her chest, "Like me." [[2281 白真真 happy]]
Zhang Yu: "Why didn't you tell me this before?" [[2282 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen rolled her eyes at Zhang Yu, as if to say, "Don't you know what you were like before?" [[2283 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen: "With your performance at the art exhibition, the school will definitely talk to you about a contract. As for whether to sign or not..." [[2284 白真真 neutral]]
Seeing the conflicted look on Bai Zhenzhen's face, Zhang Yu asked, "Is it that hard to choose?" [[2285 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen sighed, "It's not that it's hard to choose. Actually, based on your personal situation, it's an easy choice." [[2286 白真真 neutral]]
"The difficult part is whether a person's self-perception is right or wrong." [[2287 白真真 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu and asked seriously, "For example, what kind of cheat did you use to comprehend the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram this time?" [[2288 白真真 neutral]]
But halfway through, she waved her hand, "Forget it, a mother shouldn't ask about cheats. You don't have to tell me." [[2289 白真真 neutral]]
"Anyway, if you're really confident that you'll get into one of the top ten universities, then don't sign this contract now." [[2290 白真真 neutral]]
"On the other hand, if you're not confident about getting into the top ten and just want to go to a regular university, then just sign the contract as long as it's not too bad." [[2291 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was thoughtful upon hearing this and asked a few more details about the school and the contract. [[2292 旁白 neutral]]
After they talked for a while, someone else approached Zhang Yu. It was a charming and pretty young girl. [[2293 旁白 neutral]]
"Hi, you were so cool just now. Can I have your contact information?" [[2294 武青青 neutral]]
Similar things had happened many times since Zhang Yu comprehended the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram. Even Lian Tianji from Ziyun High School had asked for his contact information. [[2295 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was gradually getting used to it. He sighed inwardly and added her. [[2296 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh, even pretty girls are taking the initiative to contact me now?" [[2297 张羽 happy]]
Zhang Yu asked, "Which school are you from?" [[2298 张羽 neutral]]
The girl replied, "I'm Wu Qingqing from Saintess College, in the honors class." [[2299 武青青 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's face suddenly stiffened. In this world of Kunxu, someone who looked like a man might not be a man, but a student in the honors class of a girls' college... must have been a man before. [[2300 旁白 neutral]]
Wu Qingqing seemed to notice the change in Zhang Yu's expression and smiled slightly, "Oh, your thinking is quite old-fashioned." [[2301 武青青 neutral]]
"Do you think our class is full of people who took advantage of the system to get into a key high school and have terrible grades?" [[2302 武青青 neutral]]
"Let me tell you, the top students in my class are no worse than you. You'll see in the next city-wide exam." [[2303 武青青 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was speechless as he watched her walk away. [[2304 旁白 neutral]]
Wait, is that what I was thinking about? [[2305 张羽 neutral]]
Kunxu... in this damn place, even transgender people are judged by their scores. [[2306 张羽 neutral]]
"Congratulations." Zhou Tianyi walked over from the side, "Did you sign a contract with a Golden Core master?" [[2307 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked at Zhou Tianyi and suddenly remembered that he had been quite unnoticeable in front of the Celestial Martial Arts Diagram. [[2308 旁白 neutral]]
Next, Zhang Yu continued his security guard duty, chatting with guests he knew and didn't know. [[2309 旁白 neutral]]
As the security work for the day was completed, his savings increased by 1,600 and 10,000 yuan, soaring to 13,300. [[2310 旁白 neutral]]
After paying off the remaining 5,000 yuan loan for the month, Zhang Yu, with a balance of 8,300, was finally free from worrying about debt collection, at least for now. [[2311 旁白 neutral]]
