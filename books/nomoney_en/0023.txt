Chapter 23: The Talk [[2313 旁白 neutral]]
One in the morning. [[2314 旁白 neutral]]
Having finished his security guard work, Zhang Yu squeezed his way through the subway and bus to get back to his rented room in the suburbs. [[2315 旁白 neutral]]
As for why the subway and buses were still packed at one in the morning, it was because 1 a.m. was the evening rush hour for night shifts in Songyang City, with countless people commuting. [[2316 旁白 neutral]]
Back home, he took a shower first. Zhang Yu checked his account balance, wondering if he could afford an air conditioner. [[2317 旁白 neutral]]
After all, a deposit of 8,300 made him feel that his life this month was much more comfortable. [[2318 旁白 neutral]]
But thinking that next month was only two weeks away, when he would have to repay a 15,000 loan, he couldn't help but frown. [[2319 旁白 neutral]]
He recalled what Bai Zhenzhen had said. [[2320 旁白 neutral]]
He murmured to himself, "A contract from the school?" [[2321 张羽 neutral]]
If signing the contract could give him a large sum of money every month, he wouldn't have to worry about the loan. [[2322 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu also knew that overthinking was pointless. Whether it was his performance in the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Illustration test or the school's contract, everything ultimately depended on his own talent and strength. [[2323 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, he took out the neural filler he had bought at the stationery store by the school gate today and consumed it. [[2324 旁白 neutral]]
Then he sat cross-legged on the bed and began to circulate the Circadian Qi-Gathering Technique, feeling strands of spiritual energy from the world flowing into his body. [[2325 旁白 neutral]]
Although he had switched the Feather Book's specialization to the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art for today's test, he would have to wait 24 hours to switch back to the Circadian Qi-Gathering Technique to continue improving it quickly. [[2326 旁白 neutral]]
But he couldn't practice the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art anyway since his Dao Heart wasn't yet level 3, and he needed to prepare for the upcoming magic competition by increasing his mana. [[2327 旁白 neutral]]
Although the Circadian Qi-Gathering Technique couldn't be rapidly improved today, the level 4 technique itself could still effectively increase his mana. [[2328 旁白 neutral]]
And so, the rest of the night passed with Zhang Yu silently breathing and circulating his energy. [[2329 旁白 neutral]]
... [[2330 旁白 neutral]]
The next morning. [[2331 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as Zhang Yu entered the classroom, he noticed something was different. [[2332 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, most students at Songyang High School were focused on their own studies and cultivation, and wouldn't pay much attention to other ordinary students in the class. [[2333 旁白 neutral]]
Two classmates might go months without saying a word to each other. [[2334 旁白 neutral]]
Just like how normally, no one paid any attention to Zhang Yu when he entered the classroom. [[2335 旁白 neutral]]
Only someone like Zhao Tianxing would wonder if his classmates were looking at him when he walked in every day. [[2336 旁白 neutral]]
But today was different. Zhang Yu could clearly feel that after he entered the classroom, classmates would occasionally steal glances at him. [[2337 旁白 neutral]]
And as soon as Zhang Yu sat down, Zhou Tianyi patted his shoulder and said, "The news that you were accepted as a disciple by a Golden Core master has spread throughout the class." [[2338 周天翊 neutral]]
"It seems like the people who went to the art exhibition with Qian Shen mentioned it in the group chat." [[2339 周天翊 neutral]]
As everyone knows, schools are one of the places where gossip travels fastest. [[2440 旁白 neutral]]
And at a key institution like Songyang High School, with its high cultivation pressure, many sterile youths, and universal phone ownership, gossip spread even faster. [[2341 旁白 neutral]]
Never mind text messages; even a photo of Zhang Yu in his security guard uniform from yesterday was already circulating in the group chat. [[2342 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu chuckled at this. [[2343 旁白 happy]]
"Are they starting to tell my story in class? That's Songyang speed for you. Let them talk." [[2344 张羽 happy]]
In these days of being forced to cultivate bitterly, feeling the attention and discussion of others about his excellent performance was a rare pleasure for Zhang Yu. [[2345 旁白 neutral]]
But then he pouted, thinking of a problem. [[2346 旁白 neutral]]
Yesterday, Li Xuelian had secretly called him into a small meeting to reject him. [[2347 旁白 neutral]]
This meant that many people present didn't know he had actually been rejected by the Golden Core master. They still thought, as Li Xuelian had said on stage, that he was going to be taken as a disciple. [[2348 旁白 neutral]]
"It would be pretty stupid of me to go up to the podium and clarify things now." [[2349 张羽 neutral]]
"Forget it, let them gossip. They'll probably forget about it after a while." [[2350 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu closed his eyes and continued to circulate the Circadian Qi-Gathering Technique, breathing in spiritual energy. [[2351 旁白 neutral]]
The classmates' discussion was just temporary entertainment. [[2352 旁白 neutral]]
As planned, his main goal was still to increase his mana with all his effort to prepare for the city-wide magic competition. [[2353 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, Zhang Yu hadn't taken more than a few breaths before his head teacher, Su Haifeng, called him out. [[2354 旁白 neutral]]
... [[2355 旁白 neutral]]
He remembered the last time he was called for a talk by Su Haifeng was on his third day in this world. [[2356 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, he still didn't have a deep understanding of Songyang High School and its teachers. [[2357 旁白 neutral]]
He had even mistakenly thought Su Haifeng was a good teacher who cared about poor students. [[2358 旁白 neutral]]
But at this moment, outside the classroom, as Zhang Yu followed behind Su Haifeng, he could feel the terrifying pressure from this head teacher of the demonstration class and grade director. [[2359 旁白 neutral]]
Wherever Su Haifeng went, the classrooms instantly fell silent, and the students trembled. [[2360 旁白 neutral]]
Qian Shen didn't dare to move, concentrating on his breathing exercises. [[2361 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing, who had just stood up to go to the bathroom, quickly sat back down and picked up a book to read. [[2362 旁白 neutral]]
Even Bai Zhenzhen sat bolt upright like a primary school student, her eyes fixed on the textbook in front of her. [[2363 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone's nerves were tense, hoping that Su Haifeng's gaze wouldn't fall on them. [[2364 旁白 neutral]]
This was Su Haifeng, the head of the first-year grade at Songyang High School, a bastard in the hearts of countless Songyang students, and the author of the research paper "On the Application Prospects of Electric Shocks in High School Teaching." [[2365 旁白 neutral]]
This was a man so intimidating that even a dog passing by would have to read a few pages. [[2366 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu followed Su Haifeng through his "learning domain" to the office, where the demon smiled at him and said, "I heard that Master Starfire wants to take you as a disciple?" [[2367 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu had no intention of deceiving the school about becoming a Golden Core disciple. After all, such a lie would be easily exposed, putting him in a passive position. [[2368 旁白 neutral]]
So he told the truth, "No, I felt Master Starfire's conditions were a bit lacking, so I refused." [[2369 张羽 neutral]]
Su Haifeng's mouth twitched. [[2370 旁白 neutral]]
This Zhang Yu was already from a poor family and hadn't given him any gifts in the three months since school started. Now that he finally had a moment in the spotlight, he was starting to act arrogant. [[2371 旁白 neutral]]
"Is it about signing the contract... trying to raise your own value?" [[2372 苏海峰 neutral]]
As expected, these poor devils get inflated egos easily. [[2373 旁白 neutral]]
However, this meant that the contract might not be so easy to sign in a moment. [[2374 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes." After a moment of thought, he took out a document and said, "The school is aware of your performance at the art exhibition in the Central Building." [[2375 苏海峰 neutral]]
"Although your grades have been slipping recently, you've been criticized by the PE teacher, you're not proactive about buying medicine, and a debt collection company has even called me, the school still cares about talented students and has decided to offer you some help." [[2376 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's eyes narrowed. [[2377 旁白 neutral]]
Truly a recognized bastard of Songyang High School. The moment he opens his mouth, it's classic PUA, isn't it? [[2378 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought about what Bai Zhenzhen had said about the contract and guessed this was likely a prelude to negotiating the terms. [[2379 旁白 neutral]]
And just as he expected, Su Haifeng placed the document in front of him and continued, "The school has prepared a student aid contract for you. The terms are much better than the previous poverty assistance plan. Take a look and see if there are any problems." [[2380 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu glanced at it and saw that after signing the contract, the school would give him 10,000 yuan a month, but this money had to be repaid, though the interest rate was much lower than a loan. [[2381 旁白 neutral]]
In addition, it required him to work for ten years in a company under the school's education group, regardless of whether he got into university or not. [[2382 旁白 neutral]]
Songyang High School belonged to the Wanxing Education Group, which in turn was under the Myriad Laws Sect, one of the Ten Great Sects. [[2383 旁白 neutral]]
This meant that after signing this contract, Zhang Yu would have to work for the Wanxing Education Group for ten years. [[2384 旁白 neutral]]
Furthermore, during the university application process, Songyang High School would have the right to decide which university and major the student would apply for. [[2385 旁白 neutral]]
"Ten thousand a month for me to sign this kind of slave contract?" [[2386 张羽 angry]]
Even if Zhang Yu hadn't seen other students' contracts, he could tell this one was rather insulting. [[2387 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu put down the document and said with a frown, "Teacher, isn't this offer too low? I make 800 an hour as a security guard at the Central Building." [[2388 张羽 angry]]
"Can a temporary job last?" Su Haifeng first dismissed the idea, then changed the subject. "I know the terms of this contract are a bit low, but the school leaders have their reasons." [[2389 苏海峰 neutral]]
"After all, what was the content of the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Illustration assessment at the art exhibition? What were the selection criteria? What were the specific qualities of all the candidates? The school doesn't have firsthand information, so it can't make its own judgment, not to mention you didn't even master the martial art in the end." [[2390 苏海峰 neutral]]
"On the contrary, your academic performance has declined significantly this month." [[2391 苏海峰 neutral]]
"The school is ultimately a place that values grades. The six-subject, 700-point evaluation system is certainly more aligned with cultivation, more reasonable, and more valued by the school board than the Heavenly Being Martial Arts Illustration. The contract process can't escape that..." [[2392 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's frown deepened because what Su Haifeng said was not without reason. [[2393 旁白 neutral]]
At Songyang High School, grades and scores were ultimately the top priority. [[2394 旁白 neutral]]
Besides him, no one at the school knew the true difficulty and power of the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art, let alone that it required a level 3 Dao Heart. [[2395 旁白 neutral]]
And Zhang Yu didn't have the right to share the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art, nor did anyone vouch for him to make others believe his claims about it. [[2396 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu said, "There's no way I can accept this contract." [[2397 张羽 angry]]
Su Haifeng smiled slightly, thinking, is he going to ask for a higher price? [[2398 旁白 neutral]]
He said lightly, "Don't be hasty. I am your head teacher, after all. I can help you fight for a bit more." [[2399 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu asked, "Can it be as high as the terms you offered Bai Zhenzhen?" [[2400 张羽 neutral]]
Su Haifeng didn't answer directly, but laughed, the meaning of his laughter self-evident. [[2401 旁白 neutral]]
Then he said, "I'm not in charge of Bai Zhenzhen's contract, but I can give you a response. Bai Zhenzhen is the top student in the grade with a score of 650. What's your score?" [[2402 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu said, "Does that mean if I become the top student in the grade, anything is negotiable?" [[2403 张羽 neutral]]
Looking at Zhang Yu's serious face, Su Haifeng smiled and took the contract back. "How well you can score depends on your own ability." [[2404 苏海峰 neutral]]
"The contract mainly depends on grades. While there can be some fluctuation in the details, it's generally divided into four tiers: A, B, C, and D." [[2405 苏海峰 neutral]]
"The monthly exam is in two weeks. If you're not satisfied with the D-tier contract, we can talk again after your next exam results are out." [[2406 苏海峰 neutral]]
