Chapter 24: Spiritual Root [[2408 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving Su Haifeng's office, Zhang Yu walked back to his classroom. [[2409 旁白 neutral]]
Next week, he had to break into the top ten in mana for his grade to qualify for the cultivation tournament representing Songyang High School. [[2410 旁白 neutral]]
The week after that, the monthly exams would start. Only with excellent scores could he get a better contract from the school. [[2411 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was fully confident he could break into the top ten in mana within a week. After all, his Zhou Tian Qi Gathering Technique was already level 4. Its level would only get higher, and his mana would increase even faster. [[2412 张羽 neutral]]
But besides mana, the monthly exams also covered physical education, Dao Heart, martial arts, and cultivation techniques. Having to drastically improve in all four over the next two weeks, Zhang Yu suddenly felt immense pressure. [[2413 张羽 neutral]]
As for the general education exam? [[2414 张羽 neutral]]
Not only was it worth only 50 points, but almost everyone in the demonstration class scored nearly full marks on it, so it didn't create any real gap between students. [[2415 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu wasn't sure how well he would ultimately do on the monthly exams in two weeks. [[2416 张羽 neutral]]
"In short... I just have to grind." [[2417 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu felt a fire light up inside him. [[2418 旁白 neutral]]
Who says a hands-on cheat is still a cheat? [[2419 张羽 neutral]]
"Feather Book! For the next two weeks, show me your limits!" [[2420 张羽 neutral]]
So as soon as he returned to the classroom, Zhang Yu began to absorb spiritual energy, fully activating his Zhou Tian Qi Gathering Technique. [[2421 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, the first class ended. [[2422 旁白 neutral]]
"Sigh, I'm so tired." [[2423 张羽 sad]]
Just as Zhang Yu relaxed a little and wanted to rest, the chilling countdown timer appeared again, forcing him to keep pushing forward. [[2424 旁白 neutral]]
"Damn it!" [[2425 张羽 angry]]
"You stupid ritual... one day I'll kill you!" [[2426 张羽 angry]]
In another corner of the classroom, Zhao Tianxing looked at the message on his phone and sighed in relief. [[2427 旁白 neutral]]
Previously, the P.E. teacher Wang Hai had sent him to find out about Zhang Yu's supply channels. When asked about the results today, Zhao Tianxing told him about the art exhibition. [[2428 旁白 neutral]]
Wang Hai's reply was: "Got it. You don't need to follow Zhang Yu for now, just maintain a good relationship with him. Come to the training grounds after school tomorrow, and I'll give you a private body-strengthening lesson." [[2429 王海 neutral]]
Not having to probe Zhang Yu for information anymore was a great relief for Zhao Tianxing. [[2430 旁白 neutral]]
And the reward of an extra training session from Wang Hai made Zhao Tianxing secretly happy. [[2431 旁白 happy]]
After all, as a top teacher, the quality of Wang Hai's private lessons was unquestionable. They were not only expensive but also often hard to get. [[2432 旁白 neutral]]
As for maintaining a good relationship with Zhang Yu... [[2433 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing looked up towards Zhang Yu's seat and saw him absorbing energy. [[2434 旁白 neutral]]
"After what happened yesterday, I must be a complete clown in his eyes." [[2435 赵天行 sad]]
Thinking about how Zhang Yu might be laughing at his clumsy performance last night, Zhao Tianxing felt his cheeks burn again. [[2436 旁白 neutral]]
But thinking of Wang Hai's private lesson, he made up his mind to go talk to Zhang Yu when he was free after class. [[2437 旁白 neutral]]
But as the morning classes went by one by one, Zhao Tianxing couldn't find a single chance to say a few words to Zhang Yu. [[2438 旁白 neutral]]
"Is he still absorbing energy?" [[2439 赵天行 neutral]]
"He's absorbing during class." [[2440 赵天行 neutral]]
"He's absorbing during the break too." [[2441 赵天行 neutral]]
"He hasn't even gone to the bathroom once... what strong kidneys." [[2442 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's intense effort was starting to make Zhao Tianxing anxious. [[2443 旁白 neutral]]
He finally waited until lunchtime. Just as Zhao Tianxing got his food and was about to sit next to Zhang Yu, [[2444 旁白 neutral]]
he saw the guy devour his meal in two bites like a ghost and then run out of the cafeteria. [[2445 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen watched and cursed inwardly: "You even have to grind during lunch? Can't you let people eat in peace?" [[2446 白真真 angry]]
Lunchtime was the only time at Songyang High School with no grades, no supervision from vultures like Su Haifeng, and no interference from perverts like Wang Hai. [[2447 旁白 neutral]]
It was a rare moment for the top students to relax, take a short break, or even gossip a little. [[2448 旁白 neutral]]
It was Songyang High School's own mental spa time. [[2449 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen was very unhappy with Zhang Yu's demonic study habits, saving even his lunch break for cultivation. [[2450 旁白 neutral]]
"Dude, if you grind this hard, how are we supposed to eat with peace of mind?" [[2451 白真真 angry]]
"What if you actually surpass us?" [[2452 白真真 angry]]
"Is this an academic arms race?" [[2453 白真真 angry]]
And when Zhao Tianxing returned to the classroom, he saw Zhang Yu was already absorbing energy again. "As I thought," he muttered to himself. [[2454 赵天行 neutral]]
For the rest of the afternoon, Zhao Tianxing couldn't find a single opportunity to talk to him. Every time he looked over, Zhang Yu was either paying close attention in class or absorbing spiritual energy. [[2455 旁白 neutral]]
Watching him, Zhao Tianxing grew more and more anxious. [[2456 旁白 neutral]]
"He's already apprenticed to a Golden Core master and he's still working this hard? Is he trying to leave no path for us ordinary students?" [[2457 赵天行 sad]]
Finally, when school ended, Zhao Tianxing found a chance to follow him, thinking Zhang Yu would be looking for a temporary job again today. [[2458 旁白 neutral]]
But he heard him say, "Looking for a temp job?" [[2459 张羽 neutral]]
"Little Zhao, as high school students, we should prioritize our studies. How can we go to work every day?" [[2460 张羽 neutral]]
"Don't think you're so great just because you earned 800 an hour. That's temporary work; you can't find it every day." [[2461 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked at his balance of 8,300 yuan, feeling confident enough to stop working for now and focus on cultivation. [[2462 旁白 neutral]]
So he went home, took a neuro-filler, and continued to absorb energy until the next morning. [[2463 旁白 neutral]]
Other than going to the bathroom and switching the Feather Book's focus back to the Zhou Tian Qi Gathering Technique, Zhang Yu spent all his time absorbing energy. [[2464 旁白 neutral]]
And so, four days passed in the blink of an eye. [[2465 旁白 neutral]]
After four days of hard cultivation, Zhang Yu's Zhou Tian Qi Gathering Technique reached level 6 (45/120). [[2466 旁白 neutral]]
His mana also rose from 8.3 to 9.4, just two spots away from the top ten in his grade. [[2467 旁白 neutral]]
... [[2468 旁白 neutral]]
In the first-year hallway. [[2469 旁白 neutral]]
Su Haifeng strolled to the back door of the classroom and looked at the students during their self-study period. [[2470 旁白 neutral]]
As the head teacher of the demonstration class, he had no class but still made a point to wander by. Naturally, he was here to boost the students' morale with his cold stare, merciless taunts, and the authority of a grade director. [[2471 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Su Haifeng noticed that the students in the classroom were grinding even harder than usual today. [[2472 旁白 neutral]]
Fewer people were going to the bathroom. [[2473 旁白 neutral]]
No one was dozing off while pretending to absorb energy. [[2474 旁白 neutral]]
The students who were actually just staring blankly at their books to avoid being caught by him were gone. [[2475 旁白 neutral]]
The rate of mind-wandering in the class had dropped significantly. [[2476 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, Su Haifeng had noticed this trend starting a couple of days ago. [[2477 旁白 neutral]]
Through his observation, he discovered that the source of this trend was the student named Zhang Yu. With Zhang Yu's crazed energy absorption, his continuous 0% mind-wandering rate, and the recent explosion in his mana... Bai Zhenzhen, Qian Shen, Zhao Tianxing, and others were the first to be stimulated. [[2478 旁白 neutral]]
And the competitive spirit that erupted from them in turn stimulated even more students. [[2479 旁白 neutral]]
The 550-pointers are grinding, the 600-pointers are grinding, the 650-pointers are grinding. How can you still rest? [[2480 旁白 neutral]]
Su Haifeng even saw a report that the average mealtime for students in the demonstration class had decreased by more than 20%. [[2481 旁白 neutral]]
Su Haifeng looked at Zhang Yu, who was still absorbing energy, and thought to himself, "Is it because his pride was hurt by what I said before?" [[2482 苏海峰 neutral]]
"Maybe I can use this trick more often in the future." [[2483 苏海峰 neutral]]
Unconsciously, he had already come up with a topic for his next research paper: "An Exploration of Insulting Students in High School Pedagogy." [[2484 旁白 neutral]]
After another satisfied look at the study atmosphere in the classroom, Su Haifeng nodded and left. [[2485 旁白 neutral]]
Not long after Su Haifeng left, the bell rang, signaling the end of school. Zhang Yu immediately stood up and headed for the school's quiet room. [[2486 旁白 neutral]]
For being the student with the lowest mind-wandering rate in the entire grade last week, Zhang Yu not only received a 500-yuan bonus and a public commendation but also one hour of free use of a Heaven-grade Spiritual Root. [[2487 旁白 neutral]]
And today was the day to redeem that one hour. [[2488 旁白 neutral]]
Since the school scheduled both the Spiritual Root rental and the quiet rooms, the reward would be forfeited if he missed his slot. So, he rushed to the rental office without delay. [[2489 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing seized the opportunity, followed behind Zhang Yu, and said, "Are you going to rent a Heaven-grade Spiritual Root?" [[2490 赵天行 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu nod, Zhao Tianxing continued, "You didn't seem to rent them from the school very often before, did you?" [[2491 赵天行 neutral]]
"Do you want me to introduce you to the models of Heaven-grade Spiritual Roots we have at our school?" [[2492 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's eyes flickered. The original Zhang Yu, due to cost, had always rented Spiritual Roots from various tutoring agencies with promotional offers. He really wasn't familiar with the models at the school. [[2493 旁白 neutral]]
After all, with the development of the times, and especially after the research and organization by the Ten Great Sects, Spiritual Roots were no longer classified as crudely as in ancient times. [[2494 旁白 neutral]]
First, in terms of grade, the Ten Great Sects divided Spiritual Roots into five levels. [[2495 旁白 neutral]]
There was the lowest-grade Human Spiritual Root, the high-grade Earth Spiritual Root, and the even higher-grade Heaven Spiritual Root. These three grades could be bought as long as one had the money. [[2496 旁白 neutral]]
Higher up were the military-grade God Spiritual Root and the special-supply Immortal Spiritual Root, exclusive to the Ten Great Sects. [[2497 旁白 neutral]]
God Spiritual Roots could only be used by the military and some special government departments. [[2498 旁白 neutral]]
Immortal Spiritual Roots could only be used by those who joined one of the Ten Great Sects. [[2499 旁白 neutral]]
As for categories, the ancient classifications like Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth Spiritual Roots... had long since disappeared in Kunxu. [[2500 旁白 neutral]]
Because the design and manufacturing industries for Spiritual Roots had become increasingly advanced and prosperous, they were now categorized by function, such as study-type, combat-type, cultivation-type, and so on. [[2501 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing continued, "The most popular Spiritual Roots in our high school are definitely the study-type and cultivation-type." [[2502 赵天行 neutral]]
"For example, the Ji Spiritual Root..." [[2503 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's face changed dramatically. "Chicken Spiritual Root?" [[2504 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing said, "It's 'Ji' as in 'to entrust'. A 'Parasitic Root' can be temporarily lodged in a person's body, transferring the mana they refine through the root to yourself. It's a favorite among many rich people." [[2505 赵天行 neutral]]
"The Muscle-Growth Root is also a favorite for many. When absorbing energy, it can refine spiritual energy into a growth-type energy and inject it directly into the muscles, accelerating muscle growth. 24-hour muscle gain, greatly improving the effectiveness of body strengthening..." [[2506 赵天行 neutral]]
