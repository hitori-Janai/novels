Chapter 20: Insight [[2033 Narration neutral]]
With two identical chills and two identical countdowns, Zhang Yu's repeated attempts led him to discover that the two ritualistic forces were pushing him in different directions. [[2034 Narration neutral]]
One would stop counting down after he cultivated spiritual energy. [[2035 Narration neutral]]
The other would stop counting down after he comprehended the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram. [[2036 Narration neutral]]
Zhang Yu instantly grew more certain of one thing: one of the two countdowns was fake. [[2037 Narration neutral]]
"It's probably an effect from the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram." [[2038 张羽 neutral]]
"Confront the terror in my heart... so it's recreating the pressure of the ritual on me?" [[2039 张羽 neutral]]
"I just didn't expect the ritual's power, recreated by the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram, to contradict the real ritual power I'm under." [[2040 张羽 neutral]]
But of the two ritual powers, which one was the fake? [[2041 Narration neutral]]
"Is it the one that stops counting down after I cultivate?" [[2042 张羽 neutral]]
"Or the one that stops after I comprehend the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram?" [[2043 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was more inclined toward the latter but couldn't make a decision lightly. [[2044 Narration neutral]]
This was because the price of choosing wrong was death. [[2045 Narration neutral]]
"Which one do I choose?" [[2046 张羽 sad]]
Listening to the ever-changing countdown in his mind, Zhang Yu was in turmoil, unable to decide. [[2047 Narration neutral]]
"If I can't choose, then I just won't." [[2048 张羽 neutral]]
His gaze hardened as he made his decision: "I'll just treat both countdowns as real." [[2049 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu then sat down on the spot, began to practice the Circulatory Qi-Gathering Method, and absorbed the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth. [[2050 Narration neutral]]
As the countdown in his mind continued, from 10 to 5 and then to 3, Zhang Yu stood up again, turned back to the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram, and tried to comprehend the martial art it contained. [[2051 Narration neutral]]
Thus, under the pressure of two countdowns, Zhang Yu alternated between practicing the Circulatory Qi-Gathering Method and comprehending the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram, moving forward with both. [[2052 Narration neutral]]
Meanwhile, at the art exhibition, people gradually began to notice Zhang Yu's strange behavior. [[2053 Narration neutral]]
The Songyang City Director of the Xianyun Group looked at Zhang Yu with curiosity and said, "This kid is cultivating one moment and then standing up to comprehend martial arts the next. What did he see?" [[2054 仙韵集团总监 neutral]]
Beside him, Li Xuelian also glanced at Zhang Yu and said thoughtfully, "It looks as if someone is forcing him to cultivate." [[2055 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Perhaps it's out of reverence for a teacher in the real world." [[2056 李雪莲 neutral]]
Just then, they saw Zhang Yu change his actions again. He stopped cultivating and began practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[2057 Narration neutral]]
It turned out that Zhang Yu had a sudden realization. The countdown that stopped when he cultivated wasn't necessarily forcing him to cultivate, but rather forcing him onto the path of studying, training, getting into university, and earning money. [[2058 Narration neutral]]
So he started trying to practice martial arts while looking at the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram. [[2059 Narration neutral]]
After all, he had already mastered the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms to the point of muscle memory. If he could practice them while comprehending the diagram, he could focus most of his spirit on the diagram itself. [[2060 Narration neutral]]
His main goal at the moment was, after all, to comprehend the martial art on the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram. [[2061 Narration neutral]]
After this attempt succeeded, he started to feel that practicing and comprehending at the same time was still a bit troublesome. He simply took out his phone and tried to study his textbooks on it while looking at the diagram. [[2062 Narration neutral]]
Finding that studying from his phone was also fine, he played the textbook audio out loud, listening to the content while comprehending the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram. [[2063 Narration neutral]]
... [[2064 Narration neutral]]
Watching Zhang Yu cultivating, practicing martial arts, and studying, Li Xuelian sighed with genuine feeling, "This child must have an incredibly strict teacher behind him, pushing him to work so hard that it has gradually become a figure of immense fear in his heart." [[2065 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Next, we'll see if he can break through mentally under all this pressure..." [[2066 李雪莲 neutral]]
But before Li Xuelian could finish her sentence, Zhang Yu walked away from the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram, went straight to the buffet table, grabbed a large plate of seafood, and returned to the diagram to eat while comprehending. [[2067 Narration neutral]]
He had suddenly remembered that eating was probably something the ritual wouldn't prevent. [[2068 Narration neutral]]
Watching this scene, Li Xuelian was slightly surprised. "Oh? Such a quick breakthrough. Under all that pressure, has he adopted a mindset of slacking off? Only then can one face the terror in their heart and continue to comprehend the martial arts in the diagram." [[2069 李雪莲 happy]]
"Perhaps he hasn't even realized it himself, but he has already overcome the fear in his heart and passed this test of the martial diagram. All his actions are now normal." [[2070 李雪莲 happy]]
Seeing a security guard about to approach Zhang Yu to stop him, Li Xuelian waved her hand, dismissing him. She was now quite curious to see how much Zhang Yu could comprehend from the diagram. [[2071 李雪莲 neutral]]
As Zhang Yu ate lobster while looking at the martial diagram, he gradually began to see clearly what kind of martial art the figure was performing. [[2072 Narration neutral]]
"It looks like a set of fist techniques?" [[2073 张羽 neutral]]
The fist technique itself wasn't complicated. Zhang Yu had a rough idea after watching it a few times, but when he looked at his Feather Book, he saw no change. Clearly, he hadn't truly learned this martial art, let alone mastered it. [[2074 Narration neutral]]
Based on his experience learning the high school's basic swordplay and the Circulatory Qi-Gathering Method, a martial art like this should have appeared as level 0 in his Feather Book after watching it just once. [[2075 Narration neutral]]
"What's wrong?" [[2076 张羽 neutral]]
Just then, Lian Tianji let out a loud laugh, his face full of confidence as he said, "I have completely understood the martial art within. It is indeed an exquisite palm technique." [[2077 炼天极 happy]]
But before he finished speaking, Qian Shen, not far away, spoke up, "What palm technique? It's clearly a leg technique." [[2078 钱深 neutral]]
Normally, Qian Shen, with a total score of 600, would never dare to speak loudly in front of someone with a score of 670. [[2079 Narration neutral]]
But having just been tested by the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram, Qian Shen was at his boldest. [[2080 Narration neutral]]
Their words soon drew opposition from others. [[2081 Narration neutral]]
Someone argued, "No, no, the art hidden in the diagram is clearly a saber technique." [[2082 陌生男1 angry]]
Someone else began to mock everyone indiscriminately: "A bunch of blind fools. It's obviously a finger technique." [[2083 陌生男2 angry]]
Bai Zhenzhen frowned slightly. What she saw was a sword art. [[2084 Narration neutral]]
Apparently, while Zhang Yu was eating and comprehending, more and more students had completed their understanding of the martial diagram. [[2085 Narration neutral]]
Lian Tianji, hearing the discussion, simply turned his gaze to Li Xuelian and asked, "Ms. Li, I wonder what kind of martial art is hidden in this diagram?" [[2086 炼天极 neutral]]
Seeing that everyone was looking at her, Li Xuelian simply smiled and said, "As for what specific martial art it is, I have no comment." [[2087 李雪莲 neutral]]
"But let me give you all a hint. The diagram has its own mysteries. If anyone here masters the martial art within, there will be a clear sign." [[2088 李雪莲 neutral]]
Everyone understood. This meant that if someone mastered the martial art in the diagram, a prompt would naturally appear on it. [[2089 Narration neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lian Tianji stepped forward without hesitation. [[2090 Narration neutral]]
Lian Tianji from Ziyun High School already possessed the absolute confidence of a prodigy. [[2091 Narration neutral]]
And after the trial just now, his self-confidence had swelled to a peak. The moment he struck, he unleashed the palm technique he had just comprehended from the diagram. [[2092 Narration neutral]]
As he moved, the sound of wind and thunder erupted, and a surging force and killing intent burst from his body, as if he were about to blast the entire exhibition hall away. [[2093 Narration neutral]]
From a distance, Zhao Tianxing had been watching the results here. Seeing this scene, he was struck with amazement. [[2094 旁白 neutral]]
"Such high physical strength, such a terrifying palm technique. This is a killing art for combat." [[2095 赵天行 happy]]
However, while Lian Tianji's physical strength was impressive for a first-year high school student, many cultivators present had graduated long ago. They were more surprised by the proficiency with which Lian Tianji executed the technique. [[2096 Narration neutral]]
Someone thought in amazement, "Is that really the palm technique he just comprehended from the diagram? Every move is so polished. The top student from Ziyun High School is truly a genius among geniuses." [[2097 陌生男3 happy]]
But after Lian Tianji finished performing the entire palm technique, the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram remained motionless, without any reaction. [[2098 Narration neutral]]
"How is that possible?" Lian Tianji said in disbelief. "I've clearly mastered the martial art from the diagram, how can it not work?" [[2099 炼天极 angry]]
Qian Shen chuckled and walked up, standing before Lian Tianji. "I told you, it's a leg technique." [[2100 钱深 happy]]
He then performed the martial art he had comprehended from the diagram. Although he wasn't as fluid as Lian Tianji, his execution of the moves was already well-practiced. [[2101 Narration neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen watched this, her brow furrowing again. "This is a body-refining martial art? Specifically for training the legs." [[2102 白真真 neutral]]
And as Qian Shen finished his final move, the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram still remained motionless, showing no sign of change. [[2103 Narration neutral]]
"How is that possible?" [[2104 钱深 angry]]
Repeating the same words as Lian Tianji, Qian Shen also stared at the martial diagram in disbelief. [[2105 Narration neutral]]
Following him, students continuously came forward to demonstrate the martial arts they had comprehended. [[2106 Narration neutral]]
Including Lian Tianji and Qian Shen, 12 students successively demonstrated a total of nine different martial arts: fist, palm, leg, finger, claw, saber, sword, spear, and staff. [[2107 Narration neutral]]
Three of them had comprehended martial arts that were repeats of what others had shown. [[2108 Narration neutral]]
But after this series of demonstrations, not a single one could trigger a reaction from the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram. [[2109 Narration neutral]]
Lian Tianji couldn't help but turn to Li Xuelian and ask again, "Ms. Li, with so many of us, has really no one succeeded?" [[2110 炼天极 sad]]
Li Xuelian didn't answer, only shaking her head slightly, a hint of disappointment in her eyes. [[2111 Narration neutral]]
Just then, Bai Zhenzhen slowly walked up. Under everyone's gaze, she used her fingers as a sword and performed a set of sword techniques. [[2112 Narration neutral]]
Although the swordplay was incomparably sharp and Bai Zhenzhen's every move could be called masterful, the crowd lost interest after a few glances. [[2113 Narration neutral]]
After all, two others had already demonstrated sword techniques without causing any change in the martial diagram. [[2114 Narration neutral]]
But who would have thought that after finishing the swordplay, Bai Zhenzhen's style would suddenly change, and she would use her hand as a saber, performing a set of saber techniques. [[2115 Narration neutral]]
Then came fist techniques, palm techniques, leg techniques... [[2116 Narration neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing said in surprise, "Did Bai Zhenzhen learn all the martial arts everyone just demonstrated?" [[2117 赵天行 happy]]
Lian Tianji frowned at the scene, thinking, "In such a short time, she can replicate everyone's demonstrated techniques just by watching once. Which key high school is this top student from?" [[2118 炼天极 neutral]]
Watching Bai Zhenzhen, who moved as if she had practiced for a long time, Qian Shen's mind was also in turmoil. [[2119 旁白 neutral]]
On the one hand, he was amazed that Bai Zhenzhen could perform all nine martial arts. On the other hand, a question kept rising in his mind: "Will performing all nine martial arts that everyone comprehended really work?" [[2120 钱深 neutral]]
Just then, to the astonishment of the crowd, the man in the Heavenly Being Martial Diagram moved. He looked at Bai Zhenzhen with a smile in his eyes, and two words appeared on the scroll. [[2121 Narration neutral]]
Not bad. [[2122 Narration neutral]]
