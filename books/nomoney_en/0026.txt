Chapter 26: Signing Up for the Magic Competition and the Monthly Exam's Arrival [[2604 旁白 neutral]]
Songyang High School. [[2605 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, four days had passed since Zhang Yu rented the Sea of Qi Spiritual Root. [[2606 旁白 neutral]]
This was the day for Songyang High School's first-year students to be selected for the city-wide Magic Competition. [[2607 旁白 neutral]]
During Mana Class. [[2608 旁白 neutral]]
As the bell rang to end class, Zhang Yu stopped his meditation for once, opening his eyes to look toward the large screen. [[2609 旁白 neutral]]
After several more days of hard cultivation, his mana had continued to surge, jumping from 9.5 to 10.5. The rapid progress made many of his classmates stare in surprise. [[2610 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method had also advanced from Level 6 to Level 8 (3/160), but only he knew about this achievement. If his classmates and teachers found out, they would be more than just surprised. [[2611 旁白 neutral]]
After all, while Zhang Yu's mana increase was fast, it wasn't unheard of. Many rich people could achieve even faster progress by spending enough money. [[2612 旁白 neutral]]
But to advance a meditation technique to Level 8 in such a short time... at least at his current level, Zhang Yu didn't know anyone else who could do that. [[2613 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at the large screen, where the mana rankings for the entire grade had appeared. [[2614 旁白 neutral]]
First Place, Bai Zhenzhen, [[2615 旁白 neutral]]
Second Place, Qian Shen, [[2616 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu scanned down the list and quickly found his own name in eighth place. [[2617 旁白 neutral]]
Eighth Place, Zhang Yu, [[2618 旁白 neutral]]
"Eighth place, huh?" Zhang Yu nodded slightly, knowing that signing up for the Magic Competition would be no problem now. [[2619 张羽 neutral]]
But a chill quickly returned to his heart. Hearing the countdown timer, Zhang Yu had to close his eyes again and seize the moment to meditate. [[2620 旁白 neutral]]
On the platform, Teacher Yan brushed her hair back, glanced at the rankings with satisfaction, and said, "Over the past week, everyone's distraction rate has dropped by another 8%, and your mana has improved 12% more efficiently than last month. I am very pleased." [[2621 严老师 happy]]
She saw Zhang Yu grabbing the time to meditate again and nodded in approval. "I want to give special praise to one student, and that is Zhang Yu." [[2622 严老师 happy]]
"Not only has he maintained a 0% distraction rate for two consecutive weeks, but his mana has taken a huge leap in the past week, jumping from 16th place to 8th. That's truly remarkable. Let's give him a round of applause." [[2623 严老师 happy]]
A few scattered claps sounded. Teacher Yan then announced that the top ten students would participate in the Magic Competition. [[2624 旁白 neutral]]
"The competition starts next month. I will send you the specific schedule and rules as soon as I get them." [[2625 严老师 neutral]]
"Alright, class dismissed." [[2626 严老师 neutral]]
"Oh, and any students who want to buy Mana-Gathering Pills, remember to come to my office. There's a discount recently..." [[2627 严老师 neutral]]
Down below, Bai Zhenzhen looked a bit thinner, her cheeks slightly sunken. [[2628 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Teacher Yan's beaming face, she thought to herself, "The only reason everyone has been working so hard is because..." [[2629 白真真 neutral]]
At this thought, she subconsciously glanced toward Zhang Yu's seat, only to find him meditating again. [[2630 旁白 neutral]]
"You beast! Zhang Yu, you animal! Stop it! Stop dragging everyone into this insane competition!" [[2631 白真真 angry]]
After cursing him in her heart, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't bear to watch her good brother advance all by himself. She closed her eyes in pain and also began to meditate. [[2632 旁白 sad]]
Not far from Bai Zhenzhen, Qian Shen had been watching both her and Zhang Yu. Seeing them both use the break and the teacher's talking time to meditate, his heart sank. [[2633 旁白 neutral]]
As a student in Songyang High's model class, Qian Shen had never been afraid of competition. [[2634 旁白 neutral]]
But after the last eight days of competing with Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, his mindset had changed. [[2635 旁白 neutral]]
"They barely even go to the bathroom or scratch an itch. I really can't be as extreme as them!" [[2636 钱深 sad]]
"Compared to them, am I the one who isn't fully evolved?!" [[2637 钱深 sad]]
Staring at the two who were still meditating, Qian Shen finally closed his eyes, unwilling to be left behind. [[2638 旁白 neutral]]
Compete! I'll just have to grind harder! [[2639 钱深 angry]]
... [[2640 旁白 neutral]]
During PE class. [[2641 旁白 neutral]]
Students were either injecting themselves with stimulants or doing physical training. The sound of beast-like roars filled the air, and the floor was slick with the strong smell of sweat. [[2642 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen wiped the sweat from her forehead and glanced at the small, dark room in the corner. [[2643 旁白 neutral]]
Because PE teacher Wang Hai had led others to isolate him, Zhang Yu had been training alone in that small room during recent PE classes. [[2644 旁白 neutral]]
But today, Zhang Yu wasn't meditating as he had been for the past few days. Instead, he had started practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[2645 旁白 neutral]]
With a series of cracking sounds, Zhang Yu's muscles bulged, erupting with ferocious power as he lifted and lowered the workout equipment, again and again... [[2646 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, he switched the specialty on his Feather Book from the Level 8 Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method to the Level 3 Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[2647 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu had his reasons for doing this. [[2648 旁白 neutral]]
First, because he lacked a matching Spiritual Root, the amount of spiritual energy he could absorb was limited, and continuing to upgrade his Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method was becoming less effective. [[2649 旁白 neutral]]
Second, he had already qualified for the Magic Competition, so his next goal was the monthly exam in nine days. [[2650 旁白 neutral]]
"My mana has improved a lot recently. Even without active meditation, the passive effect of the Level 8 Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method is still 65% as effective." [[2651 张羽 neutral]]
"My mana score on the monthly exam will be good. Continuing to invest heavily in it... is not the most efficient way to raise my overall score." [[2652 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu calculated in his head, "So, to improve my monthly exam score, I need to focus on Dao Heart, PE, Martial Arts, and Dao Techniques." [[2653 张羽 neutral]]
"For Dao Heart... although I haven't mastered the Heavenly Martial Heart-Refining Art, I understand its principles. That should be enough to get a good score on the Dao Heart test." [[2654 张羽 neutral]]
"For Martial Arts, aside from the 20 points from theory, the other 80 points are from combat. For that, I'd need to hire a sparring partner, so improvement won't be fast." [[2655 张羽 neutral]]
"Dao Techniques are even harder. It's impossible to improve in a short time." [[2656 张羽 neutral]]
After thinking it over, Zhang Yu decided it was best to spend the next nine days improving his Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms and his Physical Strength. [[2657 旁白 neutral]]
And while practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, he discovered an unexpected benefit from his Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method. [[2658 旁白 neutral]]
As he exerted his strength and his muscles contracted and expanded, the mana cycle in his body continued to run, converting wisps of spiritual energy into mana. [[2659 旁白 neutral]]
During this process, as the mana flowed through his strained tendons and torn muscles, it began to nourish the damaged parts, heal his flesh and blood, speed up recovery, and enhance the effectiveness of his training. [[2660 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms could achieve a similar effect with mana once it reached Level 3. [[2661 旁白 neutral]]
But now, under the influence of the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method, a more complex and delicate mana circulation continuously covered his entire body, greatly improving his recovery and training results. [[2662 旁白 neutral]]
He felt that if he could normally only practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms twenty or thirty times a day, with the help of the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method, he could now practice it at least fifty or sixty times. [[2663 旁白 neutral]]
So, for the next few days, Zhang Yu planned to start grinding the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[2664 旁白 neutral]]
As these thoughts crossed his mind, a wave of emotion hit him. [[2665 旁白 neutral]]
"I think I'm getting more and more used to the grind." [[2666 张羽 sad]]
"Sigh, this broken Kunxu really turns people into monsters." [[2667 张羽 sad]]
But after practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms for 15 consecutive repetitions, Zhang Yu realized he was wrong. [[2668 旁白 neutral]]
He lay on the floor, drenched in so much sweat that you could almost see the outline of his body on the ground. [[2669 旁白 neutral]]
Even the PE teacher, Wang Hai, if he saw this diligent scene, would surely say: "Good work, take a rest." [[2670 旁白 neutral]]
But the one supervising Zhang Yu was not a person. It would only say... Ritual: You must continue training. [[2671 旁白 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill your wish. Do not deliberately slack off. 10." [[2672 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu sighed in despair, "You idiot! I'm at my limit." [[2673 张羽 sad]]
This is torture! [[2674 旁白 neutral]]
This physical grind was so much more painful than meditation. [[2675 旁白 sad]]
Zhang Yu felt like his lungs were working like a bellows, and every inch of his body screamed with a tearing pain. [[2676 旁白 neutral]]
"I was so naive to think I had already adapted to this broken world." [[2677 张羽 sad]]
Hearing the constant countdown in his ear, Zhang Yu remained lying on the floor like a dead fish. Only when the countdown was about to end did he suddenly jump up, enduring the pain and exhaustion, and continue his training. [[2678 旁白 neutral]]
Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 3 (22/30) [[2679 旁白 neutral]]
After forcing himself through another repetition, Zhang Yu collapsed into his own puddle of sweat again, listening to the chilling countdown and feeling the ritual's power threatening to tear his body apart. [[2680 旁白 neutral]]
"How can any human adapt to this world?" [[2681 张羽 sad]]
"Dammit... Before I'm driven to jump off a building, I have to break this stupid ritual!" [[2682 张羽 angry]]
That day at noon, Zhang Yu did something unusual. To the surprise of Bai Zhenzhen and Zhou Tianyi, he spent over 100 yuan on a huge bucket of food. [[2683 旁白 neutral]]
If the growth of mana required absorbing more spiritual energy, [[2684 旁白 neutral]]
Then the improvement of physical training required eating more nutritious food. [[2685 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm going to eat ten pounds!" [[2686 张羽 happy]]
Seeing the size of Zhang Yu's lunch, Bai Zhenzhen knew how hard he must have trained in PE class today. [[2687 旁白 neutral]]
"Has he had enough of the mana competition and is now starting on physical strength?" [[2688 白真真 neutral]]
When did this guy start trying so hard? [[2689 白真真 neutral]]
Could it be the extra competitiveness from not being neutered? [[2690 白真真 neutral]]
Watching Zhang Yu swallow a whole chicken leg and crunch the bones into pieces in a few bites, Bai Zhenzhen found herself eating faster too. [[2691 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi said helplessly, "Slow down, you two. No one is grading you on your eating speed." [[2692 周天翊 neutral]]
Not far away, Su Haifeng, also eating in the cafeteria, looked at some of the slow-eating students and thought, "The lunch break is still too long." [[2693 旁白 neutral]]
"I've been saying the school should install more security cameras in the cafeteria. Any student who takes more than 10 minutes to eat should be publicly criticized and fined." [[2694 旁白 neutral]]
With this in mind, he drafted a proposal to send to the principal, suggesting this valuable cafeteria improvement. [[2695 旁白 neutral]]
For the next few days, besides his regular classes, Zhang Yu spent every free moment practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. When he reached his physical limit, he was forced to meditate and absorb spiritual energy. [[2696 旁白 neutral]]
After days of this torture, the monthly exam finally arrived. [[2697 旁白 neutral]]
