Chapter 15: Central Tower [[1554 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing the words "Golden Core Master," Zhao Tianxing, who was in the car, was slightly startled, then said in disbelief, "How could the daughter of a Golden Core Master come to Songyang?" [[1555 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu also nodded from the side. He knew that above Qi Refining was Foundation Establishment, and above Foundation Establishment was Golden Core. [[1556 旁白 neutral]]
To reach the Golden Core realm, one had to graduate from a top high school, get into one of the ten great academies, and develop within a major sect, climbing who knows how high in Kunxu. [[1557 旁白 neutral]]
The daughter of such a person would be born on at least the second level of Kunxu or higher. How could she come to Songyang City on the first level? [[1558 旁白 neutral]]
The driver smiled upon hearing this, seemingly wanting to show off, and said slowly, "It's not just Ms. Li Xuelian who is coming to our Songyang City." [[1559 司机 neutral]]
"It's said that her father, Master Xinghuo, came from our Songyang City. He is retiring now, so he plans to return to Songyang to live out his years..." [[1560 司机 neutral]]
Zhang Yu found this strange as he listened. A mighty Golden Core expert returning to the beginner's village to retire? [[1561 旁白 neutral]]
The driver continued, "This art exhibition has more than just Ms. Li's paintings. There is also a 'Celestial Being Martial Demonstration Painting' by Master Xinghuo himself, which is said to hide a peerless martial art." [[1562 司机 neutral]]
"Among the people coming to this exhibition, besides those who want to befriend Ms. Li, many others want to comprehend this painting and learn the peerless martial art from it." [[1563 司机 neutral]]
... [[1564 旁白 neutral]]
Songyang Central Tower. [[1565 旁白 neutral]]
The 999th floor. [[1566 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, looking with shock at the sea of clouds below his feet. This was the first time he had ever stood at such a height to look down on the entire city. [[1567 旁白 neutral]]
Adjusting the new security guard uniform he was wearing, Zhang Yu sighed inwardly. [[1568 旁白 neutral]]
Since entering the Central Tower, Zhang Yu felt as if he had arrived in another, dreamlike world. [[1569 旁白 neutral]]
If the suburban environment where he lived was somewhat similar to his previous life, then the infrastructure of Songyang High School had already surpassed his last world in many aspects, and the Central Tower before him... [[1570 旁白 neutral]]
...was a fantastical scene, from its terrifying 999-story height to the various cultivation technologies inside, filled with the flow of mana. [[1571 旁白 neutral]]
Recalling how he had been pulled up to the 999th floor in just a few seconds by a formation array, yet remained completely unharmed, Zhang Yu couldn't help but feel amazed again. [[1572 旁白 neutral]]
"It's all Songyang City, but ordinary people live in the suburbs, cultivators gather in the city center, and this Central Tower is the territory of the truly wealthy." [[1573 张羽 neutral]]
"Three places, all within one city, yet they are like three different, separate worlds..." [[1574 张羽 neutral]]
Just then, Zhao Tianxing's voice came from behind him, "Zhang Yu, the captain told us to come over and patrol. Shouldn't we get going?" [[1575 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu turned around and looked at Zhao Tianxing, who was also wearing a security uniform. [[1576 旁白 neutral]]
But unlike Zhang Yu's calmness in the uniform, Zhao Tianxing was very uncomfortable and timid... looking as miserable as if he'd soiled his pants. [[1577 旁白 neutral]]
He felt like a clown in this security uniform, and that everyone who looked at him had a gaze filled with disdain, contempt, and scorn. [[1578 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhao Tianxing was overthinking it. After putting on the uniform, he was no longer an ordinary person; he became part of the background, his presence in most people's eyes barely higher than a potted plant. [[1579 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu clapped him on the shoulder and said, "Chest out, head up. We're security guards at the Central Tower now, not delivery boys. What are you afraid of?" [[1580 张羽 neutral]]
Feeling that the passersby were attracted by Zhang Yu's voice, Zhao Tianxing quickly said, "I know, Zhang Yu, please keep your voice down so we don't disturb others." [[1581 赵天行 neutral]]
The art exhibition was quite large, occupying a space of over a thousand square meters and offering drinks and a buffet. To Zhang Yu, it seemed more like a party than an art viewing. [[1582 旁白 neutral]]
The legendary 'Celestial Being Martial Demonstration Painting' was currently covered by a curtain, and it was said that Ms. Li Xuelian herself would unveil it. [[1583 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing were assigned to patrol a relatively remote area of the venue. [[1584 旁白 neutral]]
Since the exhibition hadn't officially started yet, the patrol was very relaxed and didn't trigger the ritual's backlash. [[1585 旁白 neutral]]
After all, the ritual's power was focused on fulfilling the wish. [[1586 旁白 neutral]]
His method to fulfill the wish was to study, cultivate, work hard to get into a university, and earn money... to ultimately fulfill the Evil God's wish. [[1587 旁白 neutral]]
Temporary jobs like this were part of earning money, and even part of studying and cultivating. The ritual's power wouldn't force him to do something else. [[1588 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, wandering around with nothing to do was much more relaxing for Zhang Yu than the strenuous cultivation of the past few days. [[1589 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, as the two approached the dining tables, they saw a group of waiters arranging plates and decorating the tables. [[1590 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu glanced over and was surprised by the dishes being laid out, "Is that... seafood?" [[1591 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing also looked over at the abalone and lobster on the plates... and nodded slightly, "They're marine creatures. I saw that one with the shell when I was out with my mom. I think it costs thirty or forty thousand a pound." [[1592 赵天行 neutral]]
"But this is the Central Tower, so it's normal to have these things." [[1593 赵天行 neutral]]
Seafood was not uncommon for Zhang Yu in his previous life; he had eaten it many times. [[1594 旁白 neutral]]
But here in Kunxu, at least on the first level, marine creatures were extremely rare. The original Zhang Yu had only ever seen them online; he had never eaten, or even seen, them in real life. [[1595 旁白 neutral]]
This was because in the entire 20 million square kilometers of Kunxu's first level... there was no ocean. [[1596 旁白 neutral]]
It was said that the marine life available in the market was either imported from the upper levels of Kunxu or farmed by organizations in artificial marine environments. [[1597 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Zhao Tianxing mention the price of tens of thousands per pound, Zhang Yu was secretly stunned, "That expensive?" [[1598 张羽 neutral]]
"What's the benefit of eating this? Does it increase mana?" [[1599 张羽 neutral]]
It was no wonder Zhang Yu thought this way. In the cultivation world he knew, both as the original Zhang Yu and now, everyone was striving unscrupulously to advance, doing everything possible to increase their mana, martial skills, techniques, physical strength, and Dao Heart... [[1600 旁白 neutral]]
Clothing, food, housing, transportation... everything in life was related to improving one's cultivation. [[1601 旁白 neutral]]
"Benefits?" Zhao Tianxing thought for a moment and finally shook his head, "I've never heard of any benefits from eating this. I think it's just for the taste." [[1602 赵天行 neutral]]
"Just for the taste?" Zhang Yu stared, stunned, at the plates of delicacies on the table. [[1603 旁白 neutral]]
As Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing were secretly observing the dining tables, a cold voice suddenly sounded from behind them. [[1604 旁白 neutral]]
"You two security guards, what are you doing snooping around here instead of patrolling properly?" [[1605 白真真 angry]]
Startled by the voice, Zhao Tianxing turned around and quickly explained, "We weren't doing anything..." [[1606 赵天行 neutral]]
But when he saw the person behind them, Zhao Tianxing froze on the spot. [[1607 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu, however, turned around calmly and looked at Bai Zhenzhen, saying, "Huh? It's Ah Zhen. What a coincidence, you came to see the art exhibition too?" [[1608 张羽 neutral]]
When the nearby Zhao Tianxing realized the person was a classmate, he felt his security uniform become even more ugly and awkward. His body twisted uncomfortably, as if he were about to defecate on the spot. [[1609 旁白 neutral]]
The thought that his job as a security guard might get back to his class, where he would be labeled as poor, a laborer, and short on money, causing his status and reputation to plummet, made Zhao Tianxing squirm even more. [[1610 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu with a blank expression and said, "I didn't expect you two to skip decades of struggle at such a young age and come here to work as security guards." [[1611 白真真 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing quickly waved his hands and explained, "No, that's not it, classmate Bai Zhenzhen. I'm just here with Zhang Yu." [[1612 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu slapped Zhao Tianxing on the shoulder forcefully, "What are you panicking about? You're a temporary security guard earning 800 an hour, enough to cover an ordinary person's food and drink for ten days. Countless people would be envious." [[1613 张羽 neutral]]
"Huh?" Zhao Tianxing was slightly stunned, having never thought that 800 an hour was a big deal. [[1614 赵天行 neutral]]
But as he looked at Bai Zhenzhen, who had suddenly gone silent, he felt a chill emanating from her. [[1615 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing had never been very familiar with this top-ranking genius girl. He only knew that she had always been cold and distant, only eating with Zhang Yu and Zhou Tianyi. [[1616 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, Zhao Tianxing's own circle had tried to invite her, but they never received a response. [[1617 旁白 neutral]]
In his mind, Bai Zhenzhen was a talented but very arrogant and unapproachable genius. [[1618 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing her expressionless and silent now, Zhao Tianxing thought she must be angry. [[1619 旁白 neutral]]
"Zhang Yu must have said something to make her angry." [[1620 旁白 neutral]]
As he was squirming and racking his brain for something to say to ease the tension, he heard Bai Zhenzhen ask coldly, "You make 800 an hour?" [[1621 白真真 neutral]]
"Yeah," Zhao Tianxing nodded foolishly, not understanding what she meant. [[1622 赵天行 neutral]]
Just then, a voice called from the other side of the tables. A waiter who was setting up called out, "Newbie, go get the dishes. What are you standing there for?" [[1623 侍者 angry]]
Bai Zhenzhen said to Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing, "I have to go get the dishes. We can talk later." [[1624 白真真 neutral]]
At the same time, she thought to herself, "Damn! Security guards make 800 an hour? I only make 500. I should have been a security guard." [[1625 白真真 angry]]
Only then did Zhao Tianxing notice that Bai Zhenzhen was wearing the same uniform as the other waiters. His face showed his shock, "Bai Zhenzhen is working here too?" [[1626 赵天行 neutral]]
"What's so strange about it? Who in this world isn't working?" Zhang Yu had recognized Bai Zhenzhen's uniform at first glance. To him, given her financial situation, it was perfectly normal for her to be working. [[1627 张羽 neutral]]
However, the thought that she could maintain her number one rank in the grade while working part-time secretly amazed him. [[1628 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah Zhen's talent is truly extraordinary. Among all the disciples of my Songyang Sect, she's probably only a little weaker than me." [[1629 旁白 neutral]]
