Chapter 6: Freedom [[674]]
"Damn it!" [[675 张羽 angry]]
Thump! [[676 旁白 neutral]]
"Damn it!" [[677 张羽 angry]]
Thump! [[678 旁白 neutral]]
"Damn it!" [[679 张羽 angry]]
Thump! Thump! [[680 旁白 neutral]]
In the pitch-black concrete room, amid low grunts and thudding sounds, Zhang Yu finally finished his second round of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, enduring the intense pain that wracked his body. [[681 旁白 neutral]]
He collapsed to the ground with a thud, gasping for air. [[682 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling his limbs still trembling slightly, Zhang Yu felt that his body had reached its absolute limit; every inch of him refused to move. [[683 旁白 neutral]]
But just then, the chilling sensation and the voice in his mind returned. [[684 旁白 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill your wish. Do not be lazy or procrastinate. 10." [[685 邪神 angry]]
"Damn it!" Zhang Yu cursed in his heart. "I'm already at my limit!" [[686 张羽 angry]]
"I really can't train anymore!" [[687 张羽 sad]]
"I have school tomorrow!" [[688 张羽 sad]]
But no matter what he said or how he explained, the countdown continued without any pause or hesitation. [[689 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the countdown nearing its end, Zhang Yu could only curse as he stumbled back to his feet and resumed his training. [[690 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, when people exercise alone, it's difficult for them to push themselves to their true limits. [[691 旁白 neutral]]
Only with a master, teacher, or coach supervising and making strict demands can a person truly push their limits again and again. [[692 旁白 neutral]]
It was the same for Zhang Yu. If he had been alone, he probably would have done the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms once or twice and then rested, too tired to move. [[693 旁白 neutral]]
But now, the ritual's power was like a devil coach, constantly watching him and using death as a threat to push him to train without a hint of laziness. [[694 旁白 neutral]]
The third time... [[695 旁白 neutral]]
The fourth time... [[696 旁白 neutral]]
The fifth time... [[697 旁白 neutral]]
All the way to the tenth time! [[698 旁白 neutral]]
Under the repeated threats of the ritual, Zhang Yu completed the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms a full ten times! [[699 旁白 neutral]]
During this time, the feeling in his muscles went from a tearing sensation to a sharp, stabbing pain, and finally to a growing numbness. He even felt as if his hands and feet were disappearing. [[700 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, every bit of his mana was forced out and channeled into his damaged muscles. [[701 旁白 neutral]]
After finishing the ten rounds, Zhang Yu felt as if both his body and his mana had been completely squeezed dry, like a rag that had been wrung out thousands of times with not a single drop left. [[702 旁白 neutral]]
Now, Zhang Yu just wanted to lie on the floor, unwilling to move even a muscle. [[703 旁白 neutral]]
To his relief, the death-chasing voice didn't sound again. It seemed to believe that he had truly given his all and reached his absolute limit. [[704 旁白 neutral]]
During his training, Zhang Yu had also started to understand the nature of the ritual's power. [[705 旁白 neutral]]
"This thing is a bit like a dumb AI. It doesn't have real intelligence, it just operates on a set of rules..." [[706 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu had seen similar things in movies, TV shows, and news reports in Kunxu. [[707 旁白 neutral]]
Powerful magic tools contained spirits, and these spirits were like artificial intelligences, possessing some wisdom to handle various problems. The most powerful ones even had intelligence equal to humans. [[708 旁白 neutral]]
Now, certain that the ritual's power wasn't going to force him to train anymore, Zhang Yu could finally relax and feel the effects of upgrading the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[709 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, as soon as he completed the tenth round, he could feel that the martial art had leveled up. [[710 旁白 neutral]]
In that instant, his knowledge and understanding of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms became much deeper. [[711 旁白 neutral]]
Many details he hadn't noticed or understood before now flashed through his mind like lightning. [[712 旁白 neutral]]
And on the Feather Book, the initial 'Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Lvl 1 (0/10)' had changed to 'Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Lvl 2 (0/20)'. [[713 旁白 neutral]]
"I just need to practice 20 more times to get it to level 3?" [[714 张羽 neutral]]
"If I keep training like this, won't I get it to level 10 soon?" [[715 张羽 happy]]
Zhang Yu knew that in the Qi Refining realm, the maximum level for martial arts and techniques was 10. [[716 旁白 neutral]]
"At that point, even without injections or pills, my training results won't be any worse than Bai Zhenzhen's... No, they might even be far better." [[717 张羽 happy]]
"If this keeps up, it's not impossible for my physical strength to become number one in the grade." [[718 张羽 happy]]
At this thought, Zhang Yu felt a surge of excitement, and the pain in his body seemed to lessen. [[719 旁白 neutral]]
"Incredible. My potential is truly incredible. Once it's unleashed by the Evil God, I'm going to soar." [[720 张羽 happy]]
With beautiful visions of the future, the physically exhausted Zhang Yu gradually felt sleepy and drifted off without realizing it. [[721 旁白 neutral]]
He slept until five the next morning, waking up instinctively, just as he had countless times before. [[722 旁白 neutral]]
But today, his limbs were sore and weak, and even opening his eyes was a struggle. [[723 旁白 neutral]]
Although he was awake, Zhang Yu had no desire to get up. He just wanted to sleep a little longer, even if it was on the concrete floor of an abandoned building. [[724 旁白 neutral]]
"Five more minutes... just five more minutes..." [[725 张羽 sad]]
But just as Zhang Yu tried to sleep in, a chilling voice echoed in his mind again. [[726 旁白 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill your wish. Do not be lazy or procrastinate. 10." [[727 邪神 angry]]
"Damn it!" Zhang Yu's eyes flew open. After listening to the voice continue and confirming it wasn't a hallucination, he could only curse as he sat up. [[728 张羽 angry]]
At that moment, Zhang Yu suddenly realized that things might be more serious than he had imagined. [[729 旁白 neutral]]
"From now on, for anything related to studying, cultivating, getting into college, or working—anything related to fulfilling my second wish... I can't slack off even a little bit?" [[730 张羽 sad]]
"A 24-hour supervisor, is that it?" [[731 张羽 angry]]
Exhausted and weary, Zhang Yu could only hurry back to his rented room. [[732 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling greasy and sweaty, he quickly paid 323.4 for water, took a five-minute shower, and then rushed to the bus stop. [[733 旁白 neutral]]
Looking up at the display at the stop, Zhang Yu thought, "The next bus arrives in ten minutes?" [[734 张羽 neutral]]
Leaning against a pole, he thought to himself, "I'll rest for a bit. Good thing that damn thing isn't telling me to use this time to train." [[735 张羽 neutral]]
The moment he had that thought, he regretted it. [[736 旁白 neutral]]
A chill ran through him, and the nightmare-like voice sounded again. [[737 旁白 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill your wish. Do not be lazy or procrastinate. 10." [[738 邪神 angry]]
"What the..." Zhang Yu cursed internally. "Is this thing monitoring my thoughts? If I think of a way to work hard and don't do it... it's going to kill me?" [[739 张羽 sad]]
And so, as the countdown continued, Zhang Yu, despite his exhaustion, began practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, surrounded by the surprised, confused, admiring, or indifferent gazes of the people around him. [[740 旁白 neutral]]
"Hah!" [[741 张羽 neutral]]
Thump! [[742 旁白 neutral]]
With a final punch, a sweaty Zhang Yu collapsed to the ground again. [[743 旁白 neutral]]
Watching the bus approach in the distance, he felt a wave of relief. "It's finally here." [[744 张羽 happy]]
And today, he even found a seat on the bus, which made him even happier. [[745 旁白 neutral]]
"Finally, I can get some proper rest." [[746 张羽 happy]]
"I'll just close my eyes for a bit. It can't possibly force me to train on the bus, can it? Unless it's breathing exercises..." [[747 张羽 neutral]]
The moment he thought of breathing exercises, he had a bad feeling. [[748 旁白 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill your wish. Do not be lazy or procrastinate. 10." [[749 邪神 angry]]
As expected, the countdown started again, forcing Zhang Yu to practice his basic breathing exercises while riding the bus. [[750 旁白 sad]]
Practicing breathing exercises on the bus sounded simple and efficient, but even the old Zhang Yu had given up after a few tries. [[751 旁白 neutral]]
First, the environment on the bus was too noisy, making it difficult to concentrate. [[752 旁白 neutral]]
Second, and most importantly, Zhang Yu, who woke up early every day, was too tired. [[753 旁白 neutral]]
When he was lucky enough to get a seat, he just wanted to take a short nap and couldn't find the energy to practice. [[754 旁白 neutral]]
The few times he had tried, he would usually start to feel drowsy and fall asleep after a short while. [[755 旁白 neutral]]
But now, forced by the ritual's power, Zhang Yu had to push himself to practice, fighting off sleepiness as he tried to absorb the spiritual energy from the world with each breath. [[756 旁白 neutral]]
At this point, he fully understood that the situation was far more serious than he had thought. [[757 旁白 neutral]]
"This isn't just a 24-hour supervisor. This is pushing me to my death at every moment." [[758 张羽 sad]]
"As long as this thing is on me, all laziness, slacking, entertainment, enjoyment, and relaxation... will be gone from my life." [[759 张羽 sad]]
"There will be no more weekends, no more holidays. My life will have no more joy. Every minute and every second will be dedicated to studying, cultivating, and working... until the second wish is fulfilled." [[760 张羽 sad]]
Zhang Yu unconsciously clutched his head. "I will become a complete learning machine, a workhorse, with no leisure time at all. I will have to be a grinder for the rest of my life... until I'm finally crushed by the pressure!" [[761 张羽 sad]]
He lamented in his heart, "If my whole life is going to be like this, then what's the point of succeeding in cultivation and living a few hundred more years? More years of life just means more years of suffering." [[762 张羽 sad]]
"Oh, heavens!" [[763 张羽 sad]]
The other passengers looked at Zhang Yu, who was holding his head in agony. [[764 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu could no longer care about them. As the "Please abide by the ritual's agreement..." countdown began again, he sat up straight, suppressed the sorrow in his heart, and continued his basic breathing exercises. [[765 旁白 sad]]
But at the same time, a new resolve began to grow within him. [[766 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, until this morning, the Zhang Yu who had arrived in this world had been somewhat lost. [[767 旁白 neutral]]
Although he thought about getting into a famous university, joining a great sect, and succeeding in cultivation, it was hard to say how much of that was the influence of the original owner's memories, a choice made by following the inertia of life. [[768 旁白 neutral]]
But at this moment, Zhang Yu finally had a goal, something he was determined to achieve, no matter the setbacks. [[769 旁白 neutral]]
That was to become strong enough—strong enough to completely remove the ritual's power that was forcing him. [[770 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu wanted... freedom! [[771 旁白 happy]]
