Chapter 2: School [[194 旁白 neutral]]
The ticking of the clock echoed endlessly as Zhang Yu sat in the classroom, seriously working on the exam paper in front of him. [[195 旁白 neutral]]
But the exam paper seemed endless. No matter how hard he worked or how much he filled in, he could never finish it. [[196 旁白 neutral]]
His seat seemed to move further and further away from his classmates until he could no longer see them, as if he were being swallowed by the darkness behind him. [[197 旁白 sad]]
Cold sweat dripped from his forehead and panic rose in his heart. The hand that had been writing nonstop grew weak and lost its strength. [[198 旁白 sad]]
Just as he fell into a bottomless darkness along with countless books and exam papers, Zhang Yu suddenly woke up in his bed. [[199 旁白 neutral]]
"Was I dreaming?" [[200 张羽 neutral]]
"It feels like these are all Zhang Yu's past memories." [[201 张羽 neutral]]
He rubbed his head, feeling countless fragmented memories from the original owner of the body rising and falling in his mind. [[202 旁白 neutral]]
Although the current Zhang Yu had control of this body, he hadn't fully integrated the original memories. He had to concentrate to recall many of the details. [[203 旁白 neutral]]
Especially the memories of yesterday's strange ritual. Whenever Zhang Yu tried to think about it, he felt dizzy and couldn't remember what happened at all. [[204 旁白 neutral]]
He checked his phone and saw it was only five in the morning. He wanted to go back to sleep, but his body wouldn't let him. [[205 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if waking up at five every day for school had become an instinct for this body. [[206 旁白 neutral]]
"Why do I feel a sense of guilt just lying here?" [[207 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu sat up, thinking this was probably an effect of the original owner's memories. [[208 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling his empty stomach, Zhang Yu stood up. "Forget it, I'll just go to school. At least I can get a full meal there." [[209 张羽 neutral]]
He remembered that Songyang High School provided three meals a day, and this month's meal fees were already paid. [[210 旁白 neutral]]
Now, with a massive debt of 700,000 and only about fifty yuan to his name, he couldn't afford to eat out. [[211 旁白 sad]]
So he left the stuffy apartment, walked through an alley filled with dirty water, and squeezed onto a bus with a crowd of people. [[212 旁白 neutral]]
Packed in a bus filled with the mixed smells of sweat and food, the air conditioning felt useless. Zhang Yu felt like a deformed takeout box being jiggled towards the city center. [[213 旁白 neutral]]
After an hour and a half and two bus transfers, a sweat-drenched Zhang Yu finally squeezed off the bus. [[214 旁白 neutral]]
Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Zhang Yu thought, "Why am I a day student, anyway?" [[215 张羽 neutral]]
"Oh, right. It's because I couldn't afford the dorm fees." [[216 张羽 sad]]
Unlike the area where Zhang Yu lived, the place he got off was in the city center. All he could see were skyscrapers and clean, wide roads. Even the air felt much fresher. [[217 旁白 neutral]]
The men and women on the streets were mostly well-dressed, looking like urban elites. [[218 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, he finally reached the school gate and saw the large characters for "Songyang Advanced Cultivation High School" from a distance. [[219 旁白 neutral]]
On the electronic screen at the school gate, there was a list of the top ten students from all three high school grades for the previous month. [[220 旁白 neutral]]
This showed that Songyang High School was a school that placed great importance on academic performance. [[221 旁白 neutral]]
If Zhang Yu were to summarize it based on his memories, Songyang High School was a place where grades were everything. It was a world where everyone judged others based on their scores. [[222 旁白 neutral]]
Studying and taking exams were as natural as breathing here, and almost everyone had an extreme prejudice based on scores. [[223 旁白 neutral]]
"Your score is so low, no wonder it takes you so long to queue in the cafeteria." "Your score is so low, you're not qualified to eat at the same table as us." "Top students should definitely insult the underachievers"... This was all considered positive energy on campus. [[224 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a world completely obsessed with scores, a hell for underachievers." [[225 张羽 sad]]
Zhang Yu looked at the screen showing 'First Year, 10th Place: Zhang Yu' and sighed. "Good thing I'm one of the high-scorers." [[226 张羽 neutral]]
"Although my ranking might not be well-deserved right now, at least it hasn't been exposed yet. I should still be able to live a decent life at school, right?" [[227 张羽 neutral]]
The cafeteria at Songyang High School served breakfast, so Zhang Yu followed his memories there. [[228 旁白 neutral]]
Along the way, he noticed that although there were many students queuing for food, it was completely silent. Almost everyone queued quietly, got their food quietly, and found a seat to eat quietly, like interlocking gears, each step running with precision. [[229 旁白 neutral]]
Some students were even reading books while eating, using every minute to study. [[230 旁白 neutral]]
After finding a random seat, Zhang Yu had just taken a bite of a meat bun when someone sat down in the empty seat opposite him. [[231 旁白 neutral]]
It was a girl with long, dark hair and a pale face. [[232 旁白 neutral]]
Her name appeared in Zhang Yu's mind. [[233 旁白 neutral]]
"Bai Zhenzhen." [[234 张羽 neutral]]
"To be precise, the top-ranked student in the first year, Bai Zhenzhen. The woman at the top of the first-year food chain." [[235 张羽 neutral]]
Looking at the girl drinking porridge in front of him, Zhang Yu wondered, "Is she my friend?" [[236 张羽 neutral]]
"Because I'm in the top ten? Is this the so-called 'top student circle'?" [[237 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen was the kind of person who looked like she was sulking if she wasn't smiling. Even ordinary words from her could sound distant and unapproachable. [[238 旁白 neutral]]
Just sitting in front of Zhang Yu without saying a word made him feel as if she had some problem with him. [[239 旁白 neutral]]
As Zhang Yu was trying to recall his memories of Bai Zhenzhen to figure out their relationship, [[240 旁白 neutral]]
the girl spoke, "After you finish eating, meet me in the small garden. I'll wait for you there." [[241 白真真 neutral]]
Watching her leave, a thoughtful look flashed in Zhang Yu's eyes. [[242 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, after he had eaten his fill, he left the cafeteria and went to the small garden behind the school. [[243 旁白 neutral]]
This was a quiet place behind the dormitory building. Since most students were rushing to the academic buildings, there was almost no one around. [[244 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen was standing in front of a flower bed. Hearing Zhang Yu's footsteps, she turned and walked quickly towards him. [[245 旁白 neutral]]
"Dad!" [[246 白真真 sad]]
She knelt on the ground with a thud, hugging Zhang Yu's leg. "There were too many people in the cafeteria just now, I was too embarrassed to say it." [[247 白真真 sad]]
"Please lend me some money. My microloan is almost a month overdue! I'm begging you..." [[248 白真真 sad]]
Witnessing this scene, Zhang Yu cursed inwardly, "What kind of broken school is this? The first and tenth-ranked students are both borrowing money to show off?" [[249 张羽 angry]]
Zhang Yu now remembered. He and Bai Zhenzhen knew each other not because of some top student circle, but because she was his 'upline' who had promoted microloans to him. [[250 旁白 neutral]]
Let me reintroduce her: Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu's classmate and a good buddy who shared information about various lending platforms, bonded by a strong friendship of borrowing money from everywhere. [[251 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking about how she was constantly scheming to borrow money from him behind that cold, poker face in the cafeteria, Zhang Yu shook his head helplessly. "Let go of me first. How could I have money to lend you?" [[252 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen shook her head. "You're only tenth in the grade, how much could you possibly spend? The loans you applied for must be much smaller than mine, right?" [[253 白真真 neutral]]
Then, she said stiffly and shyly, "As long as you help me pay off my debt, you can do whatever you want." [[254 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's eyes lit up. Seeing the usually cold Bai Zhenzhen now blushing like a peach blossom, he found her exceptionally charming. [[255 旁白 neutral]]
He looked her up and down and asked, "Really, anything?" [[256 张羽 happy]]
Bai Zhenzhen bit her lip and nodded. "Yes." [[257 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Can I use you as collateral?" [[258 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen let go of him and stared. "Yu, are you really broke?" [[259 白真真 angry]]
Zhang Yu showed her his phone's balance and overdue notifications. [[260 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen stood up, dusted off her pants, and looked at Zhang Yu in disbelief. "You owe seven hundred thousand? Even after graduating from university, you'd have to work for a long time to pay that off." [[261 白真真 angry]]
"You're only in your first year of high school and you're already spending so much?" [[262 白真真 angry]]
Bai Zhenzhen shook her head repeatedly. "Zhang Yu, how on earth did you spend all that money?" [[263 白真真 angry]]
Zhang Yu rubbed his head. "I forgot... Let me think." [[264 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen looked at him suspiciously. "You didn't invest it in something, did you? Were you scammed?" [[265 白真真 angry]]
As Zhang Yu tried to remember, he became uncertain. "Probably... not?" [[266 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen's expression turned serious. The more she thought about it, the more she felt something was wrong with how Zhang Yu spent the 700,000. "Let me see your phone." [[267 白真真 angry]]
Zhang Yu knew she was worried about him. After all, investment, fraud, gambling, sudden death, and cultivation deviation were the top five causes of death in Songyang City, with cultivation deviation ranking fifth. [[268 旁白 neutral]]
He also had his own doubts about the original owner of the body, so he handed over his phone. "Good, I also want to review how this money was spent. Let's look at the transactions together." [[269 张羽 neutral]]
The two looked at the phone screen, seeing every expense made by the original Zhang Yu. [[270 旁白 neutral]]
As Zhang Yu saw these, details of related memories flooded his mind. [[271 旁白 neutral]]
Danding Pharmacy [[272 旁白 neutral]]
Danding Pharmacy [[273 旁白 neutral]]
Time Waits for No One Meditation Room [[274 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu explained as he looked, "This is when I bought pills from the school pharmacy and then rented a meditation room for breathing exercises..." [[275 张羽 neutral]]
Besides general courses like language, math, physics, and history, Songyang High School's curriculum included cultivation-related courses. [[276 旁白 neutral]]
The so-called path of cultivation was the journey from being a human to becoming an immortal step by step. This was the most important part of the high school curriculum, with the highest score weight, and the key to getting into a prestigious university. [[277 旁白 neutral]]
Breathing exercises were the most basic skill in cultivation. By gathering spiritual energy from the atmosphere through these exercises, a cultivator could accumulate mana in their body. [[278 旁白 neutral]]
Only with enough mana could one achieve greater combat power and reach higher realms. Mana was the foundation for all cultivation techniques. [[279 旁白 neutral]]
For example, to break through from the Qi Refining realm to the Foundation Establishment realm, one needed over 60 points of mana. The maximum mana a Qi Refining cultivator could have was 100 points. [[280 旁白 neutral]]
In the system built by the Ten Great Sects, everything was standardized and digitized as much as possible, even mana. The current mana tests in school were accurate to one decimal place. [[281 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen nodded slightly and continued to scroll. [[282 旁白 neutral]]
Shuixiu Catering Services Co., Ltd. [[283 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu said, "This is for nutritional supplementation meals in the cafeteria. It cost quite a bit." [[284 张羽 neutral]]
In cultivation, physical strength was also crucial. Consuming large amounts of food rich in spiritual energy and cultivation elements was a daily routine for cultivators, known as nutritional supplementation. [[285 旁白 neutral]]
Longxiang Education Services Co., Ltd. [[286 旁白 neutral]]
Longxiang Education Services Co., Ltd. [[287 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu recalled for a moment and said, "Hmm... this is for the last tutoring session, and the fee for renting a Spiritual Root." [[288 张羽 neutral]]
A Spiritual Root was a special talent that only a few geniuses possessed, greatly increasing a cultivator's training efficiency and combat power. [[289 旁白 neutral]]
As the most famous barrier to entry in cultivation, even Zhang Yu and his mother in middle school had heard legends about Spiritual Roots. The original Zhang Yu even used renting a Spiritual Root as an excuse to get money from his mother to pay for his tutoring and loans. [[290 旁白 neutral]]
However, with the advancement of cultivation technology, ordinary people like Zhang Yu who didn't have a Spiritual Root could now pay to rent one to improve their training efficiency. [[291 旁白 neutral]]
As they continued scrolling, besides the initial explanations from Zhang Yu, the subsequent expenses were mostly similar, almost all related to cultivation practice. [[292 旁白 neutral]]
After quickly reviewing Zhang Yu's expenses from the last few months, Bai Zhenzhen looked at him with pity. "You really spent all this money on your own cultivation?" [[293 白真真 sad]]
"And you only managed to get to tenth place after owing over seven hundred thousand?" [[294 白真真 sad]]
"It's only been three months since school started, right? What are you going to do now?" [[295 白真真 sad]]
As someone who had just transmigrated to another world a day ago, Zhang Yu was naturally lost about the future. He shrugged and said, "I'll just take it one step at a time and figure something out." [[296 张羽 neutral]]
Seeing it was almost time for class, the two walked towards the academic building while talking. [[297 旁白 neutral]]
"How come you, who owes over seven hundred thousand, seem more relaxed than me, who owes over two hundred thousand?" [[298 白真真 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu's calm expression, Bai Zhenzhen reminded him, "You won't have any money to spend on your studies from now on!" [[299 白真真 angry]]
"Do you know the consequences of not having money for studying? Do you know how dangerous our situation is right now?" [[300 白真真 angry]]
Zhang Yu: "What consequences?" [[301 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen said, "The monthly exam is in three weeks. For three weeks, you won't have money to rent a Spiritual Root, buy pills, attend tutoring, or even buy your daily supplements... While everyone else is improving every second, it'll be normal for your rank to drop by dozens. Then you'll be kicked out of the demonstration class!" [[302 白真真 angry]]
As Bai Zhenzhen spoke, more related memories flooded Zhang Yu's mind. [[303 旁白 neutral]]
There were ten classes in the first year, from Class 1 to Class 10, assigned based on monthly exam results. [[304 旁白 neutral]]
According to his ranking, Zhang Yu was naturally assigned to Class 1, the one with the best resources, also known as the demonstration class. [[305 旁白 neutral]]
And the monthly exam results were not just about the general knowledge tests; the most important factor was the cultivation score. [[306 旁白 neutral]]
After all, general education only accounted for 50 points, while the cultivation subjects added up to a total of 650 points. [[307 旁白 neutral]]
Especially since they were all first-year students who had just started cultivating after school began, their cultivation levels were actually quite similar. [[308 旁白 neutral]]
Although he seemed to be in tenth place, if he couldn't maintain his previous rate of progress for the next few weeks, he could easily fall dozens of places. [[309 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen continued, "If you keep having no money, your ranking will get worse, your treatment will get worse, and in this vicious cycle, you'll be kicked from Class 1 all the way down to Class 10!" [[310 白真真 sad]]
Her face was grim. "No money, no grades, you'll become flammable trash in the eyes of the teachers, a joke to the demonstration class students, and an object for the cheap self-superiority of the ordinary class nobodies!" [[311 白真真 sad]]
Bai Zhenzhen held her head. "In that situation, forget about cultivation resources, it'll be hard to even maintain a stable Dao Heart. Your grades will only get worse, and you'll eventually fall below the elimination line, kicked out of Songyang High School with injuries and a mountain of debt." [[312 白真真 sad]]
As if seeing that tragic future in her mind, Bai Zhenzhen looked up at the sky and lamented, "Do you want to live at the bottom of the school's food chain, constantly insulted! And eventually become a high school dropout, a piece of social scum?" [[313 白真真 sad]]
Zhang Yu's mouth twitched. "So what do you suggest I do?" [[314 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen was silent for a moment, then turned her head. "Brother, to be honest... spending seven hundred thousand to only get to tenth place, you might really not be suited for cultivation." [[315 白真真 sad]]
"I don't know how you got into Songyang, but my advice is... drop out and go work. Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll only sink deeper." [[316 白真真 sad]]
Zhang Yu didn't respond, but sighed inwardly, "The only good thing about this damn world is that I can cultivate, and on my first day, you're telling me I have no talent for it?" [[317 张羽 sad]]
Shortly after returning to the classroom, Zhang Yu's phone vibrated. He saw that Bai Zhenzhen had transferred him 500 yuan and sent a message. [[318 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen: Pay your utility bills first. [[319 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was stunned for a moment, then sniffed his clothes and immediately understood that Bai Zhenzhen had smelled that he hadn't showered in days. [[320 旁白 neutral]]
Although he had gotten used to the smell, it must have been quite noticeable to others. [[321 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking about how she sent him money despite her own poor financial situation, Zhang Yu sighed, typed a long message on his phone, then deleted it all and simply replied: Thanks. [[322 张羽 neutral]]
After replying, Zhang Yu looked at his palm and saw that the symbol on it was now half-filled with black. [[323 旁白 neutral]]
On his way to school and into the classroom, Zhang Yu had realized that only he could see the symbol on his palm. [[324 旁白 neutral]]
He calculated the time and estimated that the symbol would be completely filled with black by tonight. He just didn't know what would happen when it was full. [[325 旁白 neutral]]
