Chapter 18: The Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram [[1822 旁白 neutral]]
Under the gazes of the guests, a tall woman slowly approached, surrounded by a crowd. [[1823 旁白 neutral]]
Her long, silver hair reflected a metallic sheen. [[1824 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu wondered if her beautiful hair was a magical relic, thinking about how much a single strand might be worth. [[1825 张羽 neutral]]
The woman's red evening gown was covered in flowing traces of firelight, as if flames were dancing within it, emitting powerful fluctuations of magical power. [[1826 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing thought that the dress itself seemed to be a magical treasure, likely priceless. [[1827 赵天行 neutral]]
Meanwhile, the director of the Xianyun Group, who looked as if he were covered in gold leaf, took the initiative to greet Li Xuelian. [[1828 旁白 neutral]]
Then, two other wealthy individuals at the Foundation Establishment stage also joined [[1829 旁白 neutral]]
their conversation. [[1830 旁白 neutral]]
They were surrounded by wealthy and famous people, all eager to chat with the four and become familiar faces. [[1831 旁白 neutral]]
But Li Xuelian didn't give them much of a [[1832 旁白 neutral]]
chance. After a brief chat with the three, she came to the curtain covering the Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram. [[1833 旁白 neutral]]
"Everyone, thank you for attending the art exhibition today." [[1834 李雪莲 happy]]
Amid the applause, Li Xuelian smiled slightly and continued, "In this moment filled with creativity and inspiration, we gather here..." [[1835 李雪莲 happy]]
Listening to Li Xuelian's speech, Zhang Yu yawned out of boredom, wondering if he should just use this time to practice his breathing exercises. [[1836 张羽 neutral]]
Suddenly, his gaze shifted as he thought to himself that he had been cultivating more diligently lately. He wasn't sure if it was because the ritual's power had forced him into the habit, or if it was the subtle influence of this world and society. [[1837 张羽 neutral]]
Fortunately, Li Xuelian's speech wasn't long. While Zhang Yu was lost in thought, she had already moved on to the topic that most interested the many cultivation geniuses present. [[1838 旁白 neutral]]
Li Xuelian: "For the past few years, my father has been searching for a disciple to inherit his legacy and pass on his martial arts and cultivation techniques." [[1839 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Unfortunately, his standards are quite high, and after searching for many years, he has yet to find a truly suitable disciple." [[1840 李雪莲 sad]]
"So, he personally painted this Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram and hid a set of martial arts techniques within it." [[1841 李雪莲 neutral]]
"If any young hero under the age of 18 can master the martial arts within, my father is willing to take them as a disciple and fully support their cultivation until they reach a top university." [[1842 李雪莲 neutral]]
"However, this painting contains a trace of my father's martial intent. Viewing it will expose you to the impact of this intent, which carries the risk of damaging your Dao Heart." [[1843 李雪莲 neutral]]
"During the comprehension process, please act according to your own abilities to avoid being injured by the martial intent within..." [[1844 李雪莲 neutral]]
Following Li Xuelian's introduction, she slowly pulled back the curtain, revealing the Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram behind it. [[1845 旁白 neutral]]
Within a frame more than two meters high, a blurry human figure slowly emerged. [[1846 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the diagram drawn by a Golden Core master?" Zhang Yu looked at the painting, feeling it was just a simple human shape scribbled randomly, no better than a primary school student's doodle. [[1847 张羽 neutral]]
Just as Zhang Yu thought this, someone shouted, "What a masterpiece!" [[1848 陌生男1 happy]]
"The painting is so vivid and spirited, the brushwork is masterful! Master Xinghuo's work is truly at its peak, it puts us to shame." [[1849 陌生男1 happy]]
Someone else quickly chimed in with flattery, "It's so beautiful! The painting seems simple, but it holds a deep meaning. The more you look, the more profound it becomes." [[1850 陌生男2 happy]]
As more and more people began to praise the Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram, Li Xuelian coughed lightly to interrupt them. Then she explained, "Everyone, to prevent this painting from unintentionally harming anyone, my father has placed a special restriction on it. Only when you are within five meters can you see its true content, but you will also be affected by the martial intent within." [[1851 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Any young heroes who wish to comprehend it, please step forward to view the painting." [[1852 李雪莲 neutral]]
Hearing Li Xuelian's words, the few who had just been flattering her immediately blushed and fell silent in embarrassment. [[1853 旁白 neutral]]
But someone had already taken a step toward the Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram. It was Lian Tianji from Ziyun High, the one who had been talking to 'Ashtray' earlier. [[1854 旁白 neutral]]
"Haha, let me, Lian Tianji, see just how mysterious this Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram really is." [[1855 炼天极 happy]]
Lian Tianji laughed as he walked briskly towards the diagram. [[1856 旁白 neutral]]
Watching this, Qian Shen's eyes flickered as he thought to himself, "It's Lian Tianji from Ziyun High. A formidable character who scored 670 on last month's exam. He's one of the opponents I must challenge after I defeat Bai Zhenzhen." [[1857 钱深 neutral]]
As Lian Tianji approached the diagram step by step, the figure in the painting grew clearer in his eyes, revealing a middle-aged man slowly demonstrating a profound martial art. [[1858 旁白 neutral]]
Lian Tianji's mind was gradually drawn in, until he saw the man in the painting throw a punch at him from across the space. [[1859 旁白 neutral]]
Bang! [[1860 旁白 neutral]]
A muffled sound seemed to echo in the air. [[1861 旁白 neutral]]
Lian Tianji stopped abruptly, his eyes wide with anger, staring intently at the Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram. [[1862 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing him standing frozen, everyone assumed Lian Tianji was completely absorbed in comprehending the mysterious martial art within the diagram. [[1863 旁白 neutral]]
Not far away, Li Xuelian explained faintly, "To select a disciple with a tenacious will and extraordinary spirit... when comprehending the Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram, one will directly face the fears in their heart." [[1864 李雪莲 neutral]]
"Only by strengthening one's spirit and overcoming inner weakness can one comprehend the mysteries of the painting." [[1865 李雪莲 neutral]]
Hearing this, the crowd was once again astonished, looking curiously at the motionless Lian Tianji, wondering what he was seeing. [[1866 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, in Lian Tianji's eyes, the world had changed. He had unknowingly returned to his classroom, as if the art exhibition, Li Xuelian, and the diagram... were all forgotten. [[1867 旁白 neutral]]
The class teacher was at the podium, announcing the results of the last monthly exam. [[1868 旁白 neutral]]
But starting from first place, he never heard his own name. [[1869 旁白 neutral]]
Not in the top 10... [[1870 旁白 neutral]]
Not in the top 20... [[1871 旁白 neutral]]
Still not in the top 50... [[1872 旁白 neutral]]
As the announced scores got lower and lower, Lian Tianji's heart grew more and more anxious... [[1873 旁白 neutral]]
At the exhibition, looking at Lian Tianji who was still comprehending the diagram, Li Xuelian said, "The Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram can be comprehended by multiple people at once. Are there any other young heroes interested in coming to the front?" [[1874 李雪莲 neutral]]
Qian Shen exchanged a look with a few classmates around him, and they all walked towards the diagram. [[1875 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, other young people who had come to comprehend the diagram also went forward. [[1876 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked at Zhou Tianyi beside him and asked curiously, "Aren't you going to give it a try?" [[1877 张羽 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi chuckled and shrugged, "I'm just here to watch the show. I'd rather not go up and embarrass myself." [[1878 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu then turned to Bai Zhenzhen and asked, "What about you? You're not going either?" [[1879 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen glanced towards the diagram and said flatly, "I'm still hesitating." [[1880 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu asked curiously, "Hesitating about what?" [[1881 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen: "I don't want to find a master for myself." [[1882 白真真 neutral]]
She thought to herself, "Becoming a disciple will definitely mean signing a contract with that Master Xinghuo, basically a contract of servitude." [[1883 白真真 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen sighed internally, "Forget everything else... just choosing a university and a major would probably be controlled by him, and I'd end up in a huge amount of debt. Who knows what the interest rates would be..." [[1884 白真真 sad]]
Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's hesitation, Zhang Yu immediately said, "Well, if you don't master this martial art, you won't have to be Master Xinghuo's disciple." [[1885 张羽 happy]]
Zhang Yu looked towards the Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram and smiled slightly, "A martial art left by a Golden Core master, even one for the Qi Refining stage, would cost us tens of thousands to buy the usage rights. Why pass up a chance to learn it for free?" [[1886 张羽 happy]]
"If you don't want to be Master Xinghuo's disciple, you just have to make sure you don't fully master it today." [[1887 张羽 happy]]
Nearby, Zhao Tianxing heard this and secretly sneered, thinking that Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were both getting ahead of themselves. He also moved a few steps away, afraid that someone might look over and lump him in with these arrogant and ignorant people. [[1888 赵天行 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu speechlessly, thinking, "To have pushed Yu-zi into this mental state... just how aggressive are the collectors from those small loan platforms?" [[1889 白真真 sad]]
Zhou Tianyi smiled, "That makes sense. It doesn't cost anything to try and comprehend it anyway. Let's go try it together." [[1890 周天翊 happy]]
But Zhao Tianxing refused Zhang Yu and Zhou Tianyi's request. Just the thought of himself comprehending the diagram in front of everyone while wearing a security or waiter uniform was too humiliating. [[1891 赵天行 neutral]]
But watching Zhang Yu walk away, he suddenly admired the guy's thick skin. [[1892 赵天行 neutral]]
Just then, the walkie-talkie on Zhao Tianxing's waist buzzed. The security captain yelled, "What are you doing? You're security! Who let him leave his post to comprehend the diagram? Get him back here now!" [[1893 保安队长 angry]]
Zhao Tianxing broke out in a cold sweat from the scolding. He quickly ran forward, shouting, trying to pull Zhang Yu back. [[1894 赵天行 neutral]]
And as Zhao Tianxing got closer to the Deva-Human Martial Arts Diagram, the figure in the painting gradually became clear, and sounds of laughter echoed around him. [[1895 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing turned to look and saw that everyone at the exhibition was staring at him, pointing and criticizing, mocking him for overestimating his abilities—a mere security guard daring to comprehend the diagram. [[1896 旁白 neutral]]
Amid the countless jeers, Zhao Tianxing slowly stopped, frozen in awkward uncertainty. He scratched his head, then his ear, not knowing how to even stand anymore. [[1897 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu and the other two approached the diagram, the blurry figure in the painting grew clearer, transforming into a resolute-faced middle-aged man who finally threw a punch at them through the air. [[1898 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen felt her vision go dark as her phone began to vibrate wildly. [[1899 旁白 neutral]]
She picked it up and saw a collection message from a loan platform. [[1900 旁白 neutral]]
"Regarding your overdue 'Owe-it' loan, due to multiple failed collection attempts, the situation is severe. Please settle the payment within three days of receiving this message. If you continue to be overdue, we will proceed according to relevant laws..." [[1901 催收短信 neutral]]
"Continued non-payment will result in a background check of your location..." [[1902 催收短信 neutral]]
"Deadbeat, you've lost all face over this small amount of money. How about your whole family helps you by collecting bottles..." [[1903 催收短信 angry]]
More and more collection messages appeared, their content becoming more and more shameless, escalating from simple reminders to all-out insults, curses, and threats... [[1904 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen stared at the endless stream of messages on her phone, covered in a cold sweat, her body tense, until her phone started ringing. [[1905 旁白 neutral]]
But looking at the constantly ringing phone, Bai Zhenzhen didn't dare to answer. [[1906 旁白 neutral]]
But even though she did nothing, the phone answered automatically. [[1907 旁白 neutral]]
To her horror, a cold male voice came from the phone. [[1908 旁白 neutral]]
"Due to loan fraud and overdue payment, you have committed a serious breach of contract. Your location has been locked via the Skynet system. If the debt is not cleared within three days, a lightning tribulation will be sent down..." [[1909 催收电话 angry]]
A clap of thunder rumbled. [[1910 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen shot her head up and saw the faint flicker of lightning in the sky above. [[1911 旁白 neutral]]
