Chapter 27: The Pre-Exam Sprint [[2699 旁白 neutral]]
Three in the morning. [[2700 旁白 neutral]]
Inside an office at Songyang High School. [[2701 旁白 neutral]]
Su Haifeng looked at the list on his computer screen and spoke into the phone, "Yes... his Dao Heart score hasn't changed." [[2702 苏海峰 neutral]]
"His mana saw a rapid increase a while ago. It seems he spent most of his time and money on breathing exercises, which is how he broke into the top 10." [[2703 苏海峰 neutral]]
"His Physical Strength hasn't been tested for three weeks because he's been isolated, but it had already dropped to 19th place. Now that he's focusing on mana, he'll be lucky to even stay at 19th." [[2704 苏海峰 neutral]]
"There's no obvious progress in martial arts or Dao techniques either. It's possible he'll drop below 30th place in these two subjects on this monthly exam." [[2705 苏海峰 neutral]]
Looking at Zhang Yu's recent academic records, Su Haifeng shook his head. "In short, I'm not optimistic about him making any significant progress on this monthly exam." [[2706 苏海峰 neutral]]
"The school will probably still offer him a Grade D contract." [[2707 苏海峰 neutral]]
"I understand. I'll do my best to persuade him to sign the contract." [[2708 苏海峰 neutral]]
"I don't know how he managed to get Li Xuelian's approval, but after taking the exam, he should understand his own situation." [[2709 苏海峰 neutral]]
After hanging up, Su Haifeng casually closed Zhang Yu's record and looked at the next document. [[2710 旁白 neutral]]
To him, Zhang Yu was just a minor issue among many. There were more important matters and more important students at Songyang High School that needed his attention. [[2711 旁白 neutral]]
... [[2712 旁白 neutral]]
Four in the morning. [[2713 旁白 neutral]]
In the abandoned building. [[2714 旁白 neutral]]
Today was the day of Songyang High School's monthly exam. [[2715 旁白 neutral]]
Although Zhang Yu's strength had improved significantly after nine days of torment, he was still seizing every moment to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, trying to boost his power a little more before the exam officially began. [[2716 旁白 neutral]]
His panel in the Feather Book's prologue now looked like this: [[2717 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu [[2718 旁白 neutral]]
Dao Heart Level 1 [[2719 旁白 neutral]]
Mana [[2720 旁白 neutral]]
Physical Strength Level 1.05 [[2721 旁白 neutral]]
His mana had increased from 10.5 to 11.7, thanks to his passive breathing exercises mixed with occasional active sessions. [[2722 旁白 neutral]]
His Physical Strength, through his intense training, had risen from level 0.85 to 1.05. [[2723 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, the biggest improvement in these nine days was the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, which was now at Level 9 (89/90). [[2724 旁白 neutral]]
As Zhang Yu threw his final punch, the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms finally reached Level 10, the maximum limit for the Qi Refining realm. [[2725 旁白 neutral]]
The moment he raised the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms to Level 10, countless memories seemed to flow through his mind—images of him practicing the forms over and over, and his deeper, more profound understanding of his own body. [[2726 旁白 neutral]]
After countless sessions of careful refinement, his body finally underwent a qualitative change and began to adjust itself in a more rational way. [[2727 旁白 neutral]]
A roaring sound seemed to echo in his mind! [[2728 旁白 neutral]]
As his heart pumped waves of Qi and blood to his limbs, Zhang Yu's entire body felt like it was undergoing a transformation. [[2729 旁白 neutral]]
His muscles contracted and expanded, and cracking sounds came from his joints. The outline of his body seemed to grow slightly larger. [[2730 旁白 neutral]]
His muscles were now better distributed for exerting force, and his bone structure became more solid and stable. His entire body seemed more balanced and coordinated. [[2731 旁白 neutral]]
This was a physical optimization that should have happened gradually while leveling up the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms to Level 10, but now it was completed in an instant. [[2732 旁白 neutral]]
Physical Strength Level 1.05 → 1.25 [[2733 旁白 neutral]]
With the optimization of his body structure, Zhang Yu's Physical Strength increased by 0.2 levels, a 20% jump. [[2734 旁白 neutral]]
More importantly, Zhang Yu could feel that this structural optimization was more than just a one-time boost. The more balanced and coordinated body he had now would help him progress faster and better on his body-refining path in the future. [[2735 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu smiled, feeling a surge of excitement. "Reaching Level 10 in the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms actually optimized my body structure." [[2736 张羽 happy]]
"Does every skill give such a big boost when it reaches Level 10?" [[2737 张羽 happy]]
This was something the teachers had never taught in class. [[2738 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu figured that Level 10 skills, even for a basic martial art like the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, were too far out of reach for first-year high school students. It was normal that the teachers wouldn't mention it. [[2739 旁白 neutral]]
"Next, I'll get the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method to Level 10 and see what happens." [[2740 张羽 neutral]]
Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method Level 8 (3/160) [[2741 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu estimated it would take him a week at most to get this breathing method to Level 10 as well. [[2742 旁白 neutral]]
However, despite this thought, he didn't immediately switch the Feather Book's specialization to the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method, because he had other plans for today. [[2743 旁白 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement. Work hard to fulfill the wish. Do not intentionally slack off or delay. 10." [[2744 邪神 neutral]]
Just as Zhang Yu was feeling excited and appreciating his progress, the damned countdown sounded again. [[2745 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu cursed a few times, but the thought that this thing had no will or intelligence left him with a feeling of emptiness, like punching cotton. [[2746 旁白 neutral]]
So he sat down cross-legged, meditating and breathing while resting his body, which was exhausted from another night of work, to recover his stamina. [[2747 旁白 neutral]]
Getting ready... to face the monthly exam. [[2748 旁白 neutral]]
... [[2749 旁白 neutral]]
Songyang High School. [[2750 旁白 neutral]]
The hurrying students had a trace of anxiety on their faces. [[2751 旁白 neutral]]
The campus today seemed to be tinged with a grim atmosphere. [[2752 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked up and saw that the original banner, "Live to die, learn to die," had been replaced with an anti-suicide slogan: "If one person jumps, the whole family pays." [[2753 旁白 neutral]]
Even the rooftop had been fenced off with barbed wire, making it harder for students to jump. [[2754 旁白 neutral]]
Beside him, Bai Zhenzhen commented with approval, "Looks like those beastly school leaders finally care about the students. They know the monthly exam can lead to suicides, so they've taken some precautions." [[2755 白真真 neutral]]
But as soon as she arrived at the cafeteria for breakfast and saw the notice that some food prices had increased, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but get angry. [[2756 旁白 neutral]]
"The prices went up again? How many times has it been since the semester started?" [[2757 白真真 angry]]
"A bunch of parasites can't even run a cafeteria properly. How can they run a school?" [[2758 白真真 angry]]
Zhang Yu tried to calm her down. "Sigh, being inhuman is normal for them. Just stay calm and don't let it affect your exam today." [[2759 张羽 sad]]
But a moment later, after hearing the new rule from the cafeteria lady, Zhang Yu shouted angrily, "Why is the 5-yuan meal limited to one per person per day? I could buy ten yesterday! Why can't students even get a full meal?!" [[2760 张羽 angry]]
"Alright, alright, Yu-zi." Bai Zhenzhen patted Zhang Yu's shoulder and comforted him, "Don't be rash, a teacher is looking over. I'll just buy an extra 'poor-man's meal' for you." [[2761 白真真 neutral]]
After getting their food and finding a seat, Zhang Yu checked his bank balance. [[2762 旁白 neutral]]
Although he had received another 500-yuan reward for 0% distraction, his savings had dropped to 6,000 due to the high cost of food for his recent body training, continuous use and purchase of neuro-fillers, and other miscellaneous expenses like transportation. [[2763 旁白 neutral]]
A new month was about to begin, which meant new loan payments, and new rent and utility bills to pay... [[2764 旁白 neutral]]
And then there was the cost of food. After starting his high-intensity body training, Zhang Yu felt his appetite growing larger and larger. Eating ten pounds a day was normal, which meant his daily food expenses were several hundred yuan, adding up to over ten thousand a month. [[2765 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu felt more and more that cultivation was something that cost more money the further you went. [[2766 旁白 neutral]]
"I hope I can get a good score on the monthly exam and get a good contract." [[2767 张羽 sad]]
"Otherwise, I'll have to go back to working part-time." [[2768 张羽 sad]]
Just then, Zhou Tianyi sat down next to them with his food tray and shook his head helplessly. "Do you guys know why the cafeteria raised its prices?" [[2769 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen both looked up sharply at Zhou Tianyi, waiting for him to continue. [[2770 旁白 neutral]]
"The city government, in order to promote Oasis Company's synthetic food, has raised the tariffs on ingredients imported from other cities. In the future, the prices of all food in Songyang City, except for synthetic food, will probably keep rising." [[2771 周天翊 sad]]
"I heard the principal is also considering switching the cafeteria's pre-made meals to synthetic food." [[2772 周天翊 sad]]
Before he started cultivating, the original Zhang Yu had eaten a lot of synthetic food, since it was much cheaper. [[2773 旁白 neutral]]
Fried insects, plant-based protein, plus recycled water and oil—it tasted so bad that even a pig wouldn't eat it. [[2774 旁白 neutral]]
"We won't even be able to get pre-made meals anymore?" [[2775 张羽 sad]]
Hearing this, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen sighed again, cursing Oasis Company and the city government for being so inhuman. [[2776 旁白 neutral]]
After breakfast, because it was the monthly exam, the three of them didn't go back to the classroom as usual, but went to their respective exam halls. [[2777 旁白 neutral]]
The morning consisted of the general education exam and the martial arts theory exam, both of which were written tests. The former was worth 50 points, the latter 20 points. [[2778 旁白 neutral]]
The afternoon was for the Dao techniques exam, worth 100 points, and the martial arts practical exam, worth 80 points. [[2779 旁白 neutral]]
The 80 points from the practical exam, combined with the 20 from the theory exam, made up the 100 points for the martial arts course. [[2780 旁白 neutral]]
The morning exams were all written, and the original Zhang Yu had already mastered this material. [[2781 旁白 neutral]]
After the exam, Zhang Yu didn't bother checking answers with other students. Instead, he quickly ate lunch and hurried to the small garden to start training. [[2782 旁白 neutral]]
Sanshou Level 1 (0/10) [[2783 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu switched the Feather Book's specialization to Sanshou, which was why he hadn't switched to the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method earlier. [[2784 旁白 neutral]]
After maxing out the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms yesterday, no matter how much he practiced the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method, he couldn't make much progress in the remaining time. [[2785 旁白 neutral]]
But if he used the daytime break to improve his Level 1 Sanshou, Zhang Yu estimated he could at least raise it to Level 2. [[2786 旁白 neutral]]
This would surely give him a significant boost for the afternoon's martial arts practical exam. [[2787 旁白 neutral]]
With this in mind, Zhang Yu practiced even more diligently. [[2788 旁白 neutral]]
As he moved, propelled by his Level 1.25 Physical Strength, his muscles and bones sang in unison. Each punch and palm strike carried the sound of wind and thunder. [[2789 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, with each move, a trace of mana was circulated to different parts of his body, enhancing the power of the strike. [[2790 旁白 neutral]]
Sanshou was a basic practical martial art. Although it had only 15 moves, including punches, palms, kicks, and throws, it not only covered various combat situations but each move also had a corresponding mana circulation route. [[2791 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was now repeatedly practicing these 15 moves. [[2792 旁白 neutral]]
As a practical martial art, the training intensity of Sanshou was far lower than that of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[2793 旁白 neutral]]
Coupled with his Level 1.25 Physical Strength, the mana circulation from his Level 8 Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method, and the body optimization from his Level 10 Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, he was able to practice the Sanshou moves at a rapid pace. After just over fifty minutes, he had raised Sanshou to Level 2. [[2794 旁白 neutral]]
Sanshou Level 1 (0/10) → Sanshou Level 2 (0/20) [[2795 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, Zhang Yu felt the 15 Sanshou moves flash through his mind, becoming deeply ingrained in his memory. [[2796 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu didn't stop. Although he felt some fatigue, he decided to continue practicing this martial art. [[2797 旁白 neutral]]
"There are two and a half hours until the afternoon exam starts." [[2798 张羽 neutral]]
"I'll see if I can push Sanshou to Level 3 before the exam." [[2799 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu continued to practice the 15 moves of Sanshou over and over, dripping with sweat. [[2800 旁白 neutral]]
His body grew more and more tired, his hands and feet gradually became sore, and his movements started to lose their form slightly. [[2801 旁白 neutral]]
But whenever Zhang Yu thought about the mountain of debt he was under and his ever-increasing expenses, he gritted his teeth and persevered. [[2802 旁白 neutral]]
Two hours later, a large drop of sweat splattered on the ground. [[2803 旁白 neutral]]
Steam was rising from Zhang Yu's body, and his muscles were intensely hot from more than three hours of high-intensity exercise. [[2804 旁白 neutral]]
But a smile appeared on Zhang Yu's face. He had finally succeeded in pushing this martial art to the third level. [[2805 张羽 happy]]
