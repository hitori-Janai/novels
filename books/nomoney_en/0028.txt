Chapter 28: Dao Arts and Combat [[2807 旁白 neutral]]
Unarmed Combat Level 2 (0/20) → Unarmed Combat Level 3 (0/30) [[2808 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, the fifteen unarmed combat moves became much more familiar in his mind. Even the follow-up variations and connections between each move became incredibly clear. [[2809 旁白 neutral]]
The mana flow for each move felt like instinct. Zhang Yu felt that if he were to execute a move now, the mana in his body would shift on its own, naturally flowing to his hands and feet. [[2810 旁白 neutral]]
"The passive breathing of the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method also helped in this process." [[2811 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu felt the mana circulating in his body. Because the mana was constantly flowing everywhere, it made channeling it for his unarmed combat techniques much smoother. [[2812 旁白 neutral]]
He was impressed by how much the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method helped beginners. It wasn't just for breathing and body strengthening; even his combat skills benefited greatly. [[2813 旁白 neutral]]
But the exams were about to start, so Zhang Yu didn't have much time to feel emotional. [[2814 旁白 neutral]]
He did some breathing exercises to recover his stamina, then hurried to the examination hall. [[2815 旁白 neutral]]
The first exam in the afternoon was Dao Arts, and the second was Martial Arts Combat. [[2816 旁白 neutral]]
The Dao Arts exam was mainly about recognizing and using talismans. [[2817 旁白 neutral]]
After all, at the Qi Refining realm, one couldn't master true Dao Arts yet. They could only use their knowledge and mana to activate talismans, so the three years of Dao Arts courses in high school were mostly about talismans. [[2818 旁白 neutral]]
The "Fu" are incantations, and the "Lu" are registers. Talismans are the secret methods for communicating with deities and controlling divine power. [[2819 旁白 neutral]]
... [[2820 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the computer lab. [[2821 旁白 neutral]]
Having arrived at the exam hall, Zhang Yu sat in front of a computer, mentally reviewing everything he knew about talismans. [[2822 旁白 neutral]]
Nearby, Zhao Tianxing was quickly flipping through his textbook, repeatedly memorizing key points he was afraid of forgetting. [[2823 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen was taking a short nap on her desk, seeming not at all nervous about the upcoming exam. [[2824 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a bell rang. The students put everything not related to the exam on the table at the front of the classroom and returned to their seats. [[2825 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, the computer screens in front of them flickered, and the exam paper appeared. [[2826 旁白 neutral]]
Question 1: Which of the following talismans belongs to the Great Deity of Universal Transport from the Ministry of Transportation. [[2827 旁白 neutral]]
Relevant information instantly surfaced in Zhang Yu's memory. [[2828 旁白 neutral]]
The Ministry of Transportation, one of Kunxu's eight divine departments, was in charge of all roads, aviation, and waterway traffic within Kunxu, holding the power to monitor all transportation. [[2829 旁白 neutral]]
The Great Deity of Universal Transport was a true god in the Ministry of Transportation responsible for city roads. Zhang Yu remembered that one of its powers was to record all surveillance data from city roads and vehicles... [[2830 旁白 neutral]]
Through talismans, one could borrow the power of the Great Deity of Universal Transport to access various surveillance feeds within the city's road network, said to reveal every detail. [[2831 旁白 neutral]]
After the memory flashed through his mind, Zhang Yu looked at the options below. [[2832 旁白 neutral]]
There were four options, looking something like this: [[2833 旁白 neutral]]
A. !*★,°*:.☆(￣▽￣)/$:*.°★*。 [[2834 旁白 neutral]]
B. (o>ε(o>u(≧∩≦)(￣ー￣)X(^▽ [[2835 旁白 neutral]]
C. ´∀`)´∀`)*▍☼´∀`)*´∀`)(((´∀ [[2836 旁白 neutral]]
D. ～o(▽｀๑۩۩o)=▊=▋=▍ [[2837 旁白 neutral]]
"All four options are the beginning of a talisman, and based on the style, they all belong to the true gods of the Ministry of Transportation... Heh, trying to mess with my head right from the start?" [[2838 张羽 neutral]]
"It should be option D, the vehicle surveillance talisman, right?" [[2839 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought for a moment, chose D, and then the next multiple-choice question appeared. [[2840 旁白 neutral]]
"Among the following talismans, which one is not a Reporting Talisman?" [[2841 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. "A Reporting Talisman? I've never learned this. Another question that's beyond the curriculum?" [[2842 张羽 neutral]]
He frowned, randomly picked one that looked plausible, and moved on to the next question. [[2843 旁白 neutral]]
He went through all the multiple-choice questions like this, followed by fill-in-the-blanks and open-ended questions. The difficulty increased sharply. [[2844 旁白 neutral]]
Questions like, "Please write a Health-Check Talisman to respectfully request the Great Deity of Health and Vitality from the Ministry of Health to check your intestines for any tumors." [[2845 旁白 neutral]]
And, "What talisman can be used to quickly subdue three ordinary people without mana, located 30 meters to the north? Please draw the talisman. Here is the specific data for the three individuals and their surroundings..." [[2846 旁白 neutral]]
"Damn it... If there are just three ordinary people, can't I just beat them up? Why do I need a talisman for that?" [[2847 张羽 angry]]
Just as Zhang Yu was sweating over writing a detention talisman, he heard the sound of a chair scraping. [[2848 旁白 neutral]]
He looked up and saw that his classmate, He Dayou, had already finished the exam and was about to leave. [[2849 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu remembered that this He Dayou was third in the last monthly exam, another one of those filthy rich people like Qian Shen. [[2850 旁白 neutral]]
But unlike Qian Shen, who focused on his scores, He Dayou loved to show off his wealth. He usually had very little interaction with Zhang Yu. [[2851 旁白 neutral]]
Turning in his paper early like this was a way of showing off his wealth. [[2852 旁白 neutral]]
This was because talismans were a subject where you needed to spend a lot of money to truly succeed. It was the exam that most clearly separated the rich from the poor. [[2853 旁白 neutral]]
Many people even called talismans the language of the rich. [[2854 旁白 neutral]]
Specifically, drawing talismans allowed one to command the power of the eight divine departments to achieve incredible things. These eight departments were often referred to as the Eight True Gods. [[2855 旁白 neutral]]
But the school only taught the most basic methods of drawing talismans. To learn more advanced ones, including many not taught in school, you had to buy registers. [[2856 旁白 neutral]]
And besides the high cost of the registers, there were also membership fees, offerings to the gods, and faith level expenses, all of which were incredibly expensive. [[2857 旁白 neutral]]
The talismans provided by the registers were not just divided by the cultivator's realm level; the most important factor was money. [[2858 旁白 neutral]]
Only by spending enough money on a register could you gain a high enough faith level to unlock more permissions, master more advanced talisman drawing techniques, and access different types of talismans. [[2859 旁白 neutral]]
After meeting all these requirements, one was qualified to practice talismans diligently. This included one-on-one talisman conversations with the Eight True Gods, error corrections guided by the gods, and talisman optimization with divine guidance while practicing... Of course, this diligent practice was also very expensive. [[2860 旁白 neutral]]
You could say that learning talismans outside of school was a process built entirely on money. [[2861 旁白 neutral]]
And during this entire process, if you violated the rules set by the Eight True Gods, like sharing talismans privately or using them to break sect laws, you would be punished. The penalty could be a fine, or at worst, bankruptcy. [[2862 旁白 neutral]]
Every time Zhang Yu had a Dao Arts class to learn talismans, he couldn't help but feel that this was a completely unfair subject. It was the best way for the rich to boost their scores in the college entrance exams and widen the gap with the poor. It truly deserved to be called the language of the rich. [[2863 旁白 sad]]
But Zhang Yu had heard from Zhou Tianyi that talismans weren't even the most expensive part of Dao Arts. [[2864 旁白 neutral]]
Many of the Dao Arts that could only be learned after Foundation Establishment cost a fortune, enough to put a college student in massive debt. [[2865 旁白 neutral]]
After finally getting through the Dao Arts exam, Zhang Yu came out of the classroom and saw a large group of people crowded around He Dayou, checking their answers. [[2866 旁白 neutral]]
He Dayou smiled faintly, took out a jade-like tablet, and scribbled on it. [[2867 旁白 neutral]]
As his mana fluctuated, a golden, ethereal figure slowly emerged from the jade tablet. [[2868 旁白 neutral]]
He Dayou smiled and said, "This is the Answer Talisman from the Great Deity of Universal Knowledge. If you have any questions, just ask it." [[2869 何大有 happy]]
Many students gasped in amazement at this sight, looking at He Dayou with envy. [[2870 旁白 neutral]]
As Zhang Yu stared at the jade tablet in He Dayou's hand, he heard Bai Zhenzhen's voice from the side, "So that's a register, huh? He even got a jade-colored skin for it. That guy must have been planning to show off for a long time, right?" [[2871 白真真 angry]]
Zhang Yu turned his head and saw Bai Zhenzhen beside him, seething with jealousy. [[2872 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu asked, "How did you do on the exam?" [[2873 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen said with dissatisfaction, "How else could I have done? At least a quarter of the talismans were ones we never learned." [[2874 白真真 angry]]
"Two years ago, the college entrance exam went 20% beyond the curriculum, and this year it's 25%? If this keeps up, by the time we take the exam, will half of it be stuff they never taught? They have no shame at all." [[2875 白真真 angry]]
"I just hope I don't run into those filthy rich guys in the combat exam. Otherwise, I'll beat them so hard they fail." [[2876 白真真 angry]]
On the other side, He Dayou seemed to notice the stares from Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu. He turned his head and gave them a slight smile. [[2877 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen instantly put on a calm and composed expression and nodded back at him. [[2878 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, the next exam was about to begin. He Dayou and a few of his friends walked towards the martial arts combat examination hall. [[2879 旁白 neutral]]
He Dayou was the kind of person who could write a primary school essay titled "My Father, the School Director." [[2880 旁白 neutral]]
Because his father really was a director of Songyang High School. [[2881 旁白 neutral]]
But despite his privileged upbringing, he didn't feel his life was easy. He was just one of his father's thirty-something children. [[2882 旁白 neutral]]
He had also gone through numerous assessments, competitions, and met family KPIs to become one of only two high school students, one of only two cultivators, among the thirty-plus siblings. [[2883 旁白 neutral]]
As for his other non-cultivator siblings, they had long since gone to work at their father's company to pay off their upbringing debts. [[2884 旁白 neutral]]
"Although I'm the child of a wealthy family, the most important reason I've gotten this far is my own effort and talent." [[2885 何大有 neutral]]
"I earned my father's investment through my hard work. Why can't I show off my wealth?" [[2886 何大有 angry]]
"Those poor people just complain all day, thinking I only got to this point because I have a rich dad. What a bunch of naive and ridiculous fools." [[2887 何大有 angry]]
With these thoughts in mind, He Dayou had always looked down on those who were poor and had bad grades. [[2888 旁白 neutral]]
And after he entered Songyang High School as the son of a director and learned more about its unspoken rules, he gradually began to look down on the poor students with good grades as well. [[2889 旁白 neutral]]
"Good grades are only temporary. These poor people have no idea... from the moment they were born, they never had a chance to get ahead." [[2890 何大有 neutral]]
"Perhaps we and them can't even be considered the same species anymore." [[2891 何大有 neutral]]
With this mindset, He Dayou maintained his rank as third in the grade, showed off his wealth from time to time, and lived a peaceful school life, waiting for the moment he would be admitted to a top university. [[2892 旁白 neutral]]
Until one person's change shattered his inner peace. [[2893 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu's increasing efforts over the past half-month, which had even caused the entire class to become more competitive, disgusted him. [[2894 旁白 neutral]]
"This kind of poor person... counts his loan payments on his fingers every month, rushes off to a part-time job right after school to earn a few hundred or a thousand, saves every penny to cultivate, and dreams of getting rich overnight and achieving immortality." [[2895 何大有 angry]]
"They have no idea who their real competitors are in the college entrance exam." [[2896 何大有 angry]]
"And yet they still jump around at school." [[2897 何大有 angry]]
"So poor it's ugly." [[2898 何大有 angry]]
He Dayou couldn't stand the sight of Zhang Yu working so desperately, as if his efforts could actually let him win against the rich. [[2899 旁白 neutral]]
Especially after hearing the rumor that Zhang Yu had been accepted as a disciple by a Golden Core master, the director's son used his connections to confirm the news. [[2900 旁白 neutral]]
After confirming that Zhang Yu had not been taken as a disciple by a Golden Core master, his dislike for him reached a new peak. [[2901 旁白 neutral]]
"He's not clarifying it on purpose. Is he trying to ride on someone else's coattails?" [[2902 何大有 angry]]
So he planned to use the combat exam as an opportunity to teach this poor guy a lesson and make him understand his true place. [[2903 旁白 neutral]]
