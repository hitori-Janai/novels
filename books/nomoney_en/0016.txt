Chapter 16: Patrol [[1631 旁白 neutral]]
Looking back at Zhao Tianxing, who was still standing there dazed, Zhang Yu urged, "Get to work, Little Zhao. Are you just standing here slacking off?" [[1632 张羽 neutral]]
Only then did Zhao Tianxing hurry to catch up, but he couldn't help looking back a few more times at Bai Zhenzhen, who was serving dishes. He thought to himself, "If I tell them back at school, they'll never believe it. Bai Zhenzhen is actually working part-time? Did something happen to her family?" [[1633 赵天行 neutral]]
After another patrol round, Zhao Tianxing followed Zhang Yu into an empty emergency exit. He saw Zhang Yu suddenly sit down cross-legged and say, "Don't just stand there. Let's take a break together." [[1634 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing: "Huh? But the captain told us to keep patrolling. What if he finds out..." [[1635 赵天行 sad]]
Zhang Yu: "The art exhibition hasn't even started yet. What's there to patrol? Besides, we're in the central tower. Are you really worried something will happen?" [[1636 张羽 neutral]]
As he spoke, Zhang Yu smiled and added, "Besides, didn't you want to chat with me? It's a good chance for me to talk to you about the way of the security guard." [[1637 张羽 happy]]
Hearing this, Zhao Tianxing remembered Wang Hai's instructions. [[1638 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu, opposite him, had already made a shocking statement: "Being a security guard is all about slacking off!" [[1639 张羽 happy]]
Zhao Tianxing: "Huh?" [[1640 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu continued, "If you patrol a few more times or a few less times, does your pay change?" [[1641 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing hesitated for a moment and asked, "I guess... it doesn't?" [[1642 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu asked again, "With or without us here, will the security level of this venue decrease?" [[1643 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing scratched his head, "I guess... it won't either? But..." [[1644 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "But the time we steal is our own." [[1645 张羽 happy]]
"Alright, I'm going to rest for a bit. We'll go out later when the exhibition officially starts." [[1646 张羽 neutral]]
Watching Zhang Yu, who had closed his eyes and started breathing exercises, Zhao Tianxing became a little nervous, afraid of being caught slacking off by his superiors. [[1647 旁白 neutral]]
He glanced again at Zhang Yu, who was completely absorbed in his breathing exercises. Zhao Tianxing admired him for seizing every moment to cultivate, but also felt he was being far too bold... [[1648 旁白 neutral]]
"Wait, wasn't I supposed to talk to him about buying the medicine? How did I get dragged into a conversation about slacking off..." [[1649 赵天行 sad]]
Suddenly, a thoughtful look appeared in Zhao Tianxing's eyes as he reflected on what Zhang Yu had just said. [[1650 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing was the type who wasn't good at socializing but was thoughtful and sensitive, always caring about what others thought and prone to overthinking. [[1651 旁白 neutral]]
As he recalled Zhang Yu's words, he realized they seemed to apply perfectly to his own situation. [[1652 旁白 neutral]]
"If I ask him a few more questions, or a few less, will Teacher Wang Hai stop guiding me?" [[1653 赵天行 neutral]]
"Without me to gather information for him, will Teacher Wang Hai really not be able to find anything out?" [[1654 赵天行 neutral]]
"Could Zhang Yu have figured out what I was trying to do? Was he saying that to give me a hint, telling me to slack off too?" [[1655 赵天行 neutral]]
Thinking of this, when Zhao Tianxing looked at the meditating Zhang Yu again, he felt that even his breathing seemed profound and mysterious. [[1656 旁白 neutral]]
As his mana flowed through him, Zhang Yu silently circulated it for one cycle, advancing his Circadian Qi-Gathering Method to (13/80). After that, the art exhibition finally began. [[1657 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1658 旁白 neutral]]
"As expected of an exhibition held by Ms. Li, all the guests are either rich or noble." [[1659 赵天行 neutral]]
Looking at the guests attending the exhibition, Zhao Tianxing sighed with sincere admiration. [[1660 旁白 neutral]]
Although he didn't know who these people were, he could tell from their luxurious clothes and accessories that each one was incredibly wealthy. [[1661 旁白 neutral]]
Even though Zhao Tianxing's father was a junior manager at a company and their financial situation was quite good, he could still recognize that many of the luxury items these people wore were things his family could never afford. [[1662 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, Zhang Yu, who was standing beside him, whispered, "Old Zhao, look at that!" [[1663 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing followed the direction of his chin and immediately saw a glittering golden figure walk in, surrounded by a crowd. [[1664 旁白 neutral]]
He looked closely and discovered that the person's entire skin was like a layer of gold foil, reflecting a faint golden light. [[1665 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu asked curiously from the side, "What is that? A robot?" [[1666 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing quickly covered Zhang Yu's mouth, watching nervously until the golden man looked away. Only then did he let out a sigh of relief. [[1667 旁白 neutral]]
Then Zhao Tianxing let go of his hand and explained, "That's the Songyang City Director of the Xianyun Group. You absolutely must not speak carelessly." [[1668 赵天行 sad]]
"Xianyun Group?" Zhang Yu looked at the golden man with curiosity and asked, "Then why... does he look so shiny?" [[1669 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing explained, "That's a Dharma-Skeleton. You don't know?" [[1670 赵天行 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu's confused expression, Zhao Tianxing figured his family probably had no contact with such things, so he patiently explained, "A Dharma-Skeleton... how should I put it? It's kind of like a prosthetic, but much, much stronger." [[1671 赵天行 neutral]]
"And in terms of cultivation technology, Dharma-Skeletons have been extended to the entire human body." [[1672 赵天行 neutral]]
"It's like you can replace any part of the body with a magical treasure, drastically improving all abilities while retaining the original functions." [[1673 赵天行 neutral]]
"But you need at least 100 mana to have a Dharma-Skeleton implanted in your body..." [[1674 赵天行 neutral]]
Hearing this, Zhang Yu's eyes flickered. He knew that 100 mana was the upper limit for the Qi Refining realm. [[1675 旁白 neutral]]
He asked, "Can you get a Dharma-Skeleton with 100 mana, or do you have to wait until Foundation Establishment?" [[1676 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing: "100 mana is enough, but this person is a true Foundation Establishment realm cultivator. He comes from a prestigious family and graduated from Myriad Laws University." [[1677 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu understood. A Foundation Establishment ancestor graduated from university and came down to the first layer to show off and put them, a bunch of stubborn Qi Refiners, in their place. [[1678 旁白 neutral]]
As more guests arrived, Zhang Yu saw two more people who seemed to have Dharma-Skeletons. One had eyes like gemstones, and the other had a halo floating behind his head, their styles clashing sharply with the other wealthy people around them. [[1679 旁白 neutral]]
These two, along with the glittering gold Director of the Xianyun Group, were like three centers of attention, occasionally attracting Qi Refiners who looked like they wanted to kneel and kowtow to them. [[1680 旁白 neutral]]
By now, Zhao Tianxing seemed to have gradually gotten used to his security guard uniform, no longer appearing so awkward as he watched the guests come and go. [[1681 旁白 neutral]]
While the two were on patrol, they happened to overhear some of the guests' conversations. [[1682 旁白 neutral]]
Some marveled at Ms. Li Xuelian's wealth and generosity. [[1683 旁白 neutral]]
Others praised how excellent the paintings in the exhibition were, and how much they should be worth. [[1684 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, some people also talked about the "Deva's Martial Demonstration" painting, personally drawn by a Golden Core Perfected. [[1685 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Li? Could it be that you're also here to comprehend the 'Deva's Martial Demonstration' painted by Senior Xinghuo?" [[1686 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Of course. If a young genius under 18 can master the martial arts within it, Senior Xinghuo will take them as a direct disciple. This news has already spread throughout the Songyang cultivation world. How could I not come?" [[1687 陌生男2 neutral]]
"Wait, there's intel like this?" Zhang Yu thought to himself, "And it's spread all over the Songyang cultivation world? How come I didn't know?" [[1688 张羽 neutral]]
Was it because small fries in the cultivation world weren't worthy of knowing? [[1689 旁白 neutral]]
But for now, Zhang Yu suppressed his doubts and decided to carry out his duties as a security guard. [[1690 旁白 neutral]]
He walked up to the person who had spoken and said politely, "Sir, are you alright?" [[1691 张羽 neutral]]
The young man who had just spoken had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, looking extraordinary. He looked at the security guard, confused, "What could be wrong with me?" [[1692 炼天极 neutral]]
The young man said proudly, "I am Lian Tianji from Ziyun High. Can't you see I'm talking with my friend?" [[1693 炼天极 angry]]
Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing looked at him, then at his so-called 'friend'. [[1694 旁白 neutral]]
It was a box on a table. The surface of the box had a special wooden texture, and its size was about that of an urn. [[1695 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu couldn't help but think, "Schizophrenia? Did studying drive him crazy?" [[1696 张羽 neutral]]
However, he had heard of Ziyun High. It was a key high school even more prestigious than Songyang High, one of the three great schools in Songyang City. It was a school that the old Zhang Yu didn't even have the qualifications to apply to, something he wouldn't dare to dream of. [[1697 旁白 neutral]]
It was said that the principals of Ziyun High were famous for their cruel methods, incredible pressure, and hellishly strict school rules. [[1698 旁白 neutral]]
The various things within Songyang High were nothing in comparison. The legendary campus caste system, where underachievers ate in the toilets, and the weak were expected to kneel before the strong... all of it was enough to terrify students from other high schools. [[1699 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at Lian Tianji, who was currently talking to an 'urn', Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh. Ziyun High really did drive people crazy. [[1700 旁白 neutral]]
But just then, the 'urn' spoke: "Brother Lian, these two security guards must have misunderstood." [[1701 李星宇 neutral]]
"I am Li Xingyu, a soul cultivator from Mangshan High." [[1702 李星宇 neutral]]
Mangshan High? A soul cultivator? [[1703 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu remembered now. Wasn't that the high school he had once tried to apply to? [[1704 旁白 neutral]]
He knew that besides the lower total score requirement for the college entrance exam, soul cultivators followed a specialized track that required them to abandon their physical bodies. [[1705 旁白 neutral]]
But looking at the 'urn' on the table, he was still shocked. "Mangshan High really turns people into ghosts." [[1706 张羽 sad]]
Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing quickly apologized and left. They then saw Lian Tianji exchange a few more words with Li Xingyu before four propeller-like things extended from the 'urn', and it flew away like a drone. [[1707 旁白 neutral]]
Watching this scene, Zhang Yu was secretly glad that his past self hadn't chosen the path of a soul cultivator. Otherwise, he wouldn't even be able to look remotely immortal. What kind of cultivator would that be? [[1708 旁白 neutral]]
"Wait, that soul cultivator doesn't even have a body. How does he plan to practice the martial arts from the 'Deva's Martial Demonstration'?" [[1709 旁白 neutral]]
Then he remembered the information the two had mentioned about the painting. [[1710 旁白 neutral]]
"If that's true, then there will probably be a lot of talented teenagers under 18 attending this exhibition, just to try and master the peerless martial arts in that 'Deva's Martial Demonstration'?" [[1711 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Zhang Yu found himself looking forward to the art exhibition even more. [[1712 旁白 neutral]]
400 yuan an hour, not only getting paid to watch a show, but also having a chance to comprehend a peerless martial art. Who said this job was bad? This job was great. [[1713 旁白 neutral]]
He turned to Zhao Tianxing beside him and asked, "How about it, Old Zhao? Are you interested in the peerless martial arts from the 'Deva's Martial Demonstration'?" [[1714 张羽 happy]]
Zhao Tianxing shook his head naturally. [[1715 旁白 neutral]]
He was very self-aware. Something that sounded like it could only be mastered by true geniuses or the wealthy had nothing to do with ordinary people like them. [[1716 旁白 neutral]]
Not only was he not interested, but he felt only a sense of withdrawal. Even if the 'Deva's Martial Demonstration' was unveiled later, he wouldn't even want to try, for fear of becoming a clown in front of everyone. [[1717 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, Zhao Tianxing, who had just been getting used to his security guard identity, wanted to cover his face and leave immediately, to shed this uniform. [[1718 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu glanced at the quickly retreating back of Zhao Tianxing, then looked in the direction he had been facing, and immediately spotted a few familiar faces. [[1719 旁白 neutral]]
"Huh? Isn't that Qian Shen? And the others look like they're from our school too, right?" [[1720 张羽 neutral]]
Qian Shen was the top student whose total score was always just behind Bai Zhenzhen's, consistently holding second place in the grade since the start of school. [[1721 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu patted Zhao Tianxing's shoulder and said, "Old Zhao, look, aren't those our classmates?" [[1722 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing quickly pulled Zhang Yu over and said anxiously, "Hurry up and turn around. Don't let them see us." [[1723 赵天行 sad]]
