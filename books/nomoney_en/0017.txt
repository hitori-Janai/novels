Chapter 17: Scores and Secrets [[1725 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm so hungry." [[1726 钱深 neutral]]
Qian Shen rubbed his belly, completely uninterested in any of the paintings in the exhibition. He just wanted to find somewhere to have a big meal. [[1727 旁白 neutral]]
After all, he had just finished his physical training makeup class and rushed over here. With his stomach growling, he felt like he could eat an entire cow. [[1728 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm going to look for something good to eat." [[1729 钱深 neutral]]
After greeting his classmates who came with him, Qian Shen began searching around the exhibition. [[1730 旁白 neutral]]
The students who came to the art exhibition with him were used to this behavior. [[1731 旁白 neutral]]
Since they studied cultivation daily and trained their bodies hard, they naturally needed much more nutrition and food than ordinary people. [[1732 旁白 neutral]]
For someone like Qian Shen, a top student who practiced cultivation 24 hours a day, he ate even more. If he only ate five meals a day, his private tutor would worry that his appetite was poor. [[1733 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, Qian Shen's eyes suddenly lit up as he focused on the buffet table. [[1734 旁白 neutral]]
He quickly walked over, grabbed a plate of shrimp, and swallowed it in a few bites. But after eating for a while, he frowned. "Why is this food so lacking in nutrition?" [[1735 钱深 angry]]
As a top student in the first year of Songyang High School, always ranking second in his grade, Qian Shen's success came not only from his talent and hard work, but most importantly, from his family's wealth. [[1736 旁白 neutral]]
To improve his cultivation results, especially his physical training effects, the food he usually ate was rich in various cultivation elements. [[1737 旁白 neutral]]
For someone who believed only in scores like him, whether food tasted good or not was secondary. What mattered most was whether it could improve his cultivation efficiency. [[1738 旁白 neutral]]
He could certainly afford the seafood provided at the exhibition buffet, but he wasn't interested in spending money just to satisfy his appetite. Instead, he felt this was a waste of his time and stomach space. [[1739 旁白 neutral]]
Seafood, fancy meals... if they couldn't improve his grades, they were just garbage. [[1740 钱深 angry]]
So while Qian Shen looked at the other dishes on the table, he called over a waiter to ask if there were any other foods that could serve as cultivation supplements. [[1741 旁白 neutral]]
"Everything you can eat is here. Take whatever you want." [[1742 白真真 neutral]]
Hearing the waiter's somewhat cold voice, Qian Shen couldn't help but frown. When he looked up, he saw a familiar face. [[1743 旁白 neutral]]
Qian Shen looked at the waiter uniform the person was wearing and said in surprise, "You're working here?" [[1744 钱深 neutral]]
"Yeah." Bai Zhenzhen replied expressionlessly. "Is there anything else?" [[1745 白真真 neutral]]
Qian Shen frowned and said, "Are you that short on money?" [[1746 钱深 neutral]]
"You should hurry up and sign a contract with the student council. Otherwise, continuing to waste time on this meaningless job will only hold back your cultivation path." [[1747 钱深 neutral]]
"When I eventually surpass you, it won't be any fun." [[1748 钱深 neutral]]
Qian Shen's tone was full of regret. After all, he had always seen Bai Zhenzhen, the only girl in their grade who could beat his total score, as his rival. [[1749 旁白 neutral]]
He felt that Bai Zhenzhen should think the same way. [[1750 旁白 neutral]]
Over the next three years of high school, their entire grade, even the entire school, would be a battlefield where these two geniuses would compete against each other while secretly respecting one another. [[1751 旁白 neutral]]
They should push each other to break through their limits in repeated competitions, and finally get into top universities together after three years. [[1752 旁白 neutral]]
But facing Qian Shen's regret, Bai Zhenzhen only said coolly, "Are you trying to tell me what to do?" [[1753 白真真 angry]]
Without waiting for Qian Shen to answer, Bai Zhenzhen continued, "You, with your total score of just over 600, want to tell me what to do when I scored 650?" [[1754 白真真 angry]]
Faced with Bai Zhenzhen's naked score discrimination, Qian Shen, as a firm believer in the "scores are everything" philosophy, immediately lost his confidence. That 50-point difference hit him like a mountain. [[1755 旁白 neutral]]
Your score is higher, so you're right. [[1756 钱深 sad]]
At that moment, in Qian Shen's eyes, it was as if there were three glowing numbers "650" floating above Bai Zhenzhen's head, giving off a powerful pressure that left him unable to say a word in response. [[1757 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen frowned. "Wait, why are you looking at the top of my head while talking to me?" [[1758 白真真 neutral]]
Qian Shen snorted coldly and turned to leave. [[1759 旁白 neutral]]
"Just wait, Bai Zhenzhen. If you keep wasting time like this, I'll definitely surpass you soon." [[1760 钱深 angry]]
But just as he turned around and took a few steps, he almost bumped into two security guards. [[1761 旁白 neutral]]
It was Zhang Yu, who had come to check on the situation, and Zhao Tianxing, whom he had dragged along. [[1762 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that Bai Zhenzhen and Qian Shen seemed to be having some conflict, Zhang Yu, as a security guard, had quickly rushed over. [[1763 旁白 neutral]]
When Qian Shen saw the two people, although they were wearing security uniforms, he still recognized them immediately as his classmates: "550 and 580?" [[1764 钱深 neutral]]
Hearing this nickname, Zhang Yu was slightly stunned. The next moment, he realized that 550 was his total score from last month's exam, and 580 seemed to be Zhao Tianxing's total score. [[1765 旁白 neutral]]
Good grief, this guy only sees scores and can't even remember his classmates' names. Another person who's gone crazy from studying. [[1766 旁白 neutral]]
But actually, Qian Shen didn't just forget names. In fact, he couldn't remember either the names or scores of students below 550. [[1767 旁白 neutral]]
After all, to him... below 550? Weren't they all just NPCs? Was there any need to remember them? [[1768 旁白 neutral]]
Like the 550 in front of him, in Qian Shen's eyes, he was already subhuman. [[1769 旁白 neutral]]
Based on his observations over this period, the other person would probably score below 550 on the next monthly exam, so starting next month, there wouldn't even be a need to remember him. [[1770 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the security uniforms Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing were wearing, Qian Shen shook his head again. "Why are you guys working part-time jobs too?" [[1771 钱深 neutral]]
Facing 550 and 580, the confidence that had just been crushed by 650 immediately returned to Qian Shen. He said proudly, "Instead of spending time studying and cultivating, why are you two wasting time here?" [[1772 钱深 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Aren't you here too?" [[1773 张羽 neutral]]
Qian Shen chuckled confidently, "I specifically canceled my tutoring session today to come here and comprehend the supreme martial arts in the Heavenly Martial Arts Diagram." [[1774 钱深 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Well, we're also here to comprehend the Heavenly Martial Arts Diagram." [[1775 张羽 neutral]]
"And we can also earn 800 yuan per hour." [[1776 张羽 neutral]]
"Making money while comprehending divine techniques - isn't that much more profitable?" [[1777 张羽 neutral]]
"Huh?" Qian Shen was slightly stunned when he heard this, looking at Zhang Yu with some surprise. He thought to himself, "A person with 550 points actually said something that makes sense?" [[1778 钱深 neutral]]
He looked at Zhang Yu and said, "550, I'll remember you." [[1779 钱深 neutral]]
"My name is Zhang Yu!" Zhang Yu couldn't help but look toward the top of his head. "Why do you keep staring at the top of my head?" [[1780 张羽 neutral]]
But Qian Shen quickly came to his senses. "No, wait. Do you two really think you can comprehend the Heavenly Martial Arts Diagram?" [[1781 钱深 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing felt more and more people's eyes looking over, and Qian Shen's scornful gaze made his cheeks slightly red. He quickly waved his hands and said, "No, no, no, I never thought about comprehending the Heavenly Martial Arts Diagram." [[1782 赵天行 sad]]
But Qian Shen was too lazy to listen to Zhao Tianxing's explanation. He just shook his head and sighed, "The Heavenly Martial Arts Diagram was personally painted by a Golden Core expert. The supreme martial arts contained within it is specifically designed to select true geniuses. Even I don't have absolute confidence in mastering it, let alone you two." [[1783 钱深 neutral]]
After saying this, Qian Shen had no interest in looking at the 550 and 580 in front of him anymore. He turned around and left. [[1784 旁白 neutral]]
Watching Qian Shen's retreating figure, Zhao Tianxing's face became even more bitter. [[1785 旁白 sad]]
Not only had the other person seen him working as a security guard, but Zhang Yu's careless words had also made him think that he came to comprehend the Heavenly Martial Arts Diagram. [[1786 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing felt bitter in his heart, as if he could already see himself being laughed at by many of his classmates. [[1787 旁白 sad]]
He thought to himself, "This trip has been a huge embarrassment." [[1788 赵天行 sad]]
Zhang Yu, on the other hand, didn't have as many complicated thoughts as Zhao Tianxing. He looked at Bai Zhenzhen and asked, "Are you okay? You don't get along well with Qian Shen?" [[1789 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen curled her lips and said casually, "What could happen to me? Most of the time, he just humiliates himself." [[1790 白真真 neutral]]
Then she looked at Zhang Yu with a somewhat strange expression. "You're also planning to comprehend the Heavenly Martial Arts Diagram?" [[1791 白真真 neutral]]
Looking at Zhang Yu nodding confidently, Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "Yu has been driven more and more crazy by that huge debt. With his level... he actually wants to comprehend martial arts left by a Golden Core master?" [[1792 白真真 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing just wanted to get out of there quickly. He tugged at Zhang Yu's clothes, wanting to leave, but noticed that Zhang Yu was making faces at Bai Zhenzhen. [[1793 旁白 neutral]]
Then he saw Bai Zhenzhen secretly slip some seafood into Zhang Yu's arms. [[1794 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Old Zhao, want to try some?" [[1795 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing said urgently, "The captain said we can't eat from the buffet." [[1796 赵天行 neutral]]
While saying this, he quickly used his body to block Zhang Yu, afraid that someone would see this. [[1797 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu said easily, "It's perfect that Zhen is also working here. We can take advantage of the company a little." [[1798 张羽 neutral]]
Just as Zhang Yu was tasting the shrimp on his plate, a voice came from behind Zhao Tianxing. [[1799 旁白 neutral]]
"What are you guys doing?" [[1800 周天翊 neutral]]
This voice startled Zhao Tianxing, but when he turned around and found that the speaker was their classmate Zhou Tianyi, he felt relieved instead. [[1801 旁白 neutral]]
Without realizing it, Zhao Tianxing seemed to have gradually gotten used to wearing a security uniform in front of his classmates. [[1802 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked at Zhou Tianyi in surprise. "Old Zhou, you're here too?" [[1803 张羽 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi smiled and said, "Yeah, I came with Qian Shen and the others." [[1804 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Really? I didn't see you just now." [[1805 张羽 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi said, "Haha, how did you end up here?" [[1806 周天翊 neutral]]
The two chatted about their respective situations, while Zhao Tianxing urged Zhang Yu to continue patrolling. [[1807 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi suddenly said mysteriously, "I have some gossip about the Golden Core master. I wonder if you're interested in hearing it?" [[1808 周天翊 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu's curious expression, Zhao Tianxing said, "The captain has already been asking in the group chat where we are..." [[1809 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu nodded. "Forget it, work is important. Let's hear what you have to say next time." [[1810 张羽 neutral]]
Just as the two were about to turn and leave, they heard Zhou Tianyi say, "Master Starfire had half of his cultivation taken away when he left his job, which is why he's planning to move back to the first floor." [[1811 周天翊 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[1812 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing immediately turned around, waiting for Zhou Tianyi to continue. [[1813 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen, though she didn't look over, also pricked up her ears to listen. [[1814 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi smiled and continued, "Golden Core masters can live up to 400 years at most. Master Starfire was already 350 years old last year and got laid off by the Myriad Law Sect." [[1815 周天翊 neutral]]
"When he left his job, half of his cultivation was taken back. He couldn't afford the expenses on the upper floors, so he wanted to move back to the first floor of Kunxu to focus on training descendants and teaching disciples." [[1816 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was shocked by this ridiculous world again. "Wait... they take away half your cultivation when you leave your job?" [[1817 张羽 angry]]
Zhou Tianyi said matter-of-factly, "The sect trained him and gave him the opportunity and resources to form his Golden Core. Isn't it normal to hand over half his cultivation when he leaves?" [[1818 周天翊 neutral]]
Just as the three were listening to Zhou Tianyi's news about Master Starfire, the crowd in the distance suddenly became restless. [[1819 旁白 neutral]]
Some guests said in low voices, "Ms. Li has arrived. The Heavenly Martial Arts Diagram is about to be unveiled." [[1820 旁白 neutral]]
