Chapter 3: Physical Education [[327 旁白 neutral]]
Without much time for reflection, soon after Zhang Yu returned to the classroom, the math teacher, wearing black-rimmed glasses, walked in with a stack of papers. [[328 旁白 neutral]]
"Today, we're going to go over the test from last time." [[329 数学老师 neutral]]
"Pass the papers out." [[330 数学老师 neutral]]
"Look at your mistakes. How many times have I told you to come ask me if you don't understand something? I sat in my office for three hours yesterday afternoon, and not a single person came to ask me a question..." [[331 数学老师 angry]]
Just after the math papers were handed out, the tall and sturdy PE teacher came into the classroom, looked at the math teacher, and said, "You're sick." [[332 王海 neutral]]
After sending the "sick" math teacher away, the PE teacher, Wang Hai, looked at the students and said, "This class is now PE." [[333 王海 neutral]]
"But don't forget to review math on your own. General studies are worth fifty points on the college entrance exam, and a single point can make a huge difference." [[334 王海 neutral]]
"Speaking of general studies, I've already talked to your language teacher. The next class will also be PE. Including the originally scheduled one, this entire morning is my PE class." [[335 王海 happy]]
The students followed PE teacher Wang Hai to the indoor training hall. It was as huge as a public square and filled with all kinds of exercise equipment. [[336 旁白 neutral]]
Wang Hai said, "The Qi Refining realm is the first stage of cultivation. What's important is to build a solid foundation. How solid your foundation is in your first year will determine how high you can reach in your second and third years..." [[337 王海 neutral]]
As he took in these familiar scenes, many detailed memories flooded back into Zhang Yu's mind. [[338 旁白 neutral]]
Since cultivation was organized by the Ten Great Sects, it had long been divided into systematic realms and power levels, covering all aspects of cultivation techniques in vast detail. [[339 旁白 neutral]]
The most widely known were the ten great realms of cultivation. [[340 旁白 neutral]]
The key factors determining which realm a person could reach were their Dao Heart level and Mana level. [[341 旁白 neutral]]
For high school students, only by surpassing level 10 in their Dao Heart and 60 points in Mana could they break through from the Qi Refining realm to the Foundation Establishment realm. [[342 旁白 neutral]]
The high school PE class, however, was for tempering the body and forging the will. [[343 旁白 neutral]]
After all, a strong body not only increased the efficiency of mana growth but also greatly helped the strong will required for the Dao Heart level, and it enhanced combat ability in the Qi Refining realm. [[344 旁白 neutral]]
If Dao Heart and Mana were the foundation of cultivation, then the Physical Strength trained in PE class was the foundation of the foundation. [[345 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, waves of light scanned the students' bodies, displaying their Physical Strength data on a large screen nearby, ranked from high to low. [[346 旁白 neutral]]
1st Place: Qian Shen, Physical Strength 1.15 [[347 旁白 neutral]]
2nd Place: Bai Zhenzhen, Physical Strength 1.13 [[348 旁白 neutral]]
3rd Place: He Dayou, Physical Strength 1.12 [[349 旁白 neutral]]
... [[350 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu had to look down to 19th place to find his own score. [[351 旁白 neutral]]
19th Place: Zhang Yu, Physical Strength 0.82 [[352 旁白 neutral]]
With the continuous development of cultivation technology in Kunxu, various data and metrics had become increasingly precise. [[353 旁白 neutral]]
For instance, Physical Strength was not only quantified but also re-tested every PE class. [[354 旁白 neutral]]
And this metric, like the Dao Heart, could only reach a maximum of level 10 in the Qi Refining realm. [[355 旁白 neutral]]
Although Physical Strength was not a key metric for breaking through cultivation realms, it affected a cultivator's efficiency and combat power, making it an important foundation. It accounted for 150 points out of the 650 for cultivation subjects. [[356 旁白 neutral]]
"Has my Physical Strength really dropped to 19th place?" [[357 张羽 sad]]
Looking at his result, Zhang Yu recalled how his peers had recently been surpassing his progress in Physical Strength. [[358 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the surrounding students took out syringes and injected various enhancement supplements into their arms. [[359 旁白 neutral]]
These supplements from different brands not only strengthened muscles and bones but also boosted training efficiency by several to ten times, making them essential drugs for first-year students. [[360 旁白 neutral]]
Here, you could skip a day of training, but you couldn't skip a day of injections. Top students often took eight or more shots a day. [[361 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu saw Bai Zhenzhen nearby give herself a total of nine shots in her bottom, arms, and thighs. [[362 旁白 neutral]]
However, compared to the many muscular figures around, Bai Zhenzhen looked much smaller. Zhang Yu remembered this was because their physical training focused on different goals, resulting in different body shapes. [[363 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu hesitate to take his injection, the PE teacher Wang Hai frowned and walked over. "Zhang Yu, how many days has it been since you took your functional enhancer?" [[364 王海 angry]]
Zhang Yu didn't dare to say he was out of money. He knew that at Songyang High, being poor was as shameful as having bad grades. He only dared to mention it to close friends like Bai Zhenzhen. [[365 旁白 neutral]]
Also, fragmented memories told him that his original self had already fainted several times due to taking too many drugs, putting a heavy strain on his organs and cardiovascular system. It was becoming life-threatening. [[366 旁白 neutral]]
So, Zhang Yu gave a vague excuse, "I want to try... without the drugs." [[367 张羽 neutral]]
Unexpectedly, Wang Hai's frown deepened, and his voice boomed like thunder, "Have you been watching those influencers who can't handle the hardship of taking drugs and promote 'natural' body tempering? That's all a scam. How can you keep up without drugs?" [[368 王海 angry]]
"Look how many ranks you've dropped! If you keep this up, you'll be kicked out of the demonstration class after the next monthly exam." [[369 王海 angry]]
He looked at him with disappointment, "Am I asking you to take drugs for my own benefit? It's not like I'll get stronger if you take them." [[370 王海 angry]]
Pointing to a student in the distance, he said, "Look at Qian Shen. 12 shots of Dragon-Elephant agent a day to grow his muscles and bones, 2 shots of painkiller to suppress the pain of his body tearing and growing, 2 shots of Gluttony agent to speed up his metabolism and absorption of cultivation elements from food, and he eats fifteen pounds of food a day to gain weight..." [[371 王海 neutral]]
"In just three months, his Physical Strength has soared from 0.13 to the current 1.15, making him the strongest physique in the first year. That's worth twenty years of your 'natural' training." [[372 王海 neutral]]
As Wang Hai spoke, Zhang Yu remembered how Qian Shen had transformed from a skinny boy under 170cm three months ago into the nearly two-meter tall, three-hundred-pound giant he was today. [[373 旁白 neutral]]
Wang Hai then pointed to another student. "And look at Zhao Tianxing, who used to be worse than you. He broke through 1.00 in Physical Strength the day before yesterday. Now his blood is like lead and mercury, his arteries are hardened like rubber, and his heart has tripled in size..." [[374 王海 neutral]]
After pointing out a few more students, Wang Hai sighed, "Zhang Yu, I'm only telling you all this because your Physical Strength used to be in the top ten. You have good talent and exceptional drug tolerance..." [[375 王海 neutral]]
Seeing Wang Hai's earnest expression, Zhang Yu could feel his concern. But whether it was due to lack of money or fear of death, he was unwilling to take any more drugs. [[376 旁白 neutral]]
Just as he was wondering how to explain, Wang Hai pulled a box of medicine from his bag. "As they say, three parts training, seven parts eating, and the other ninety parts depend on your injections." [[377 王海 neutral]]
"This is the new Divine Elephant Power functional enhancer from the Jingang Sect. Quality guaranteed from a major sect. One shot is as good as ten." [[378 王海 neutral]]
"To be honest, this stuff is still in the lab. I got it from a good friend. Seeing your talent, I'll sell it to you at a 20% discount. Ten vials for 8800..." [[379 王海 neutral]]
Seeing Wang Hai trying to sell him drugs, Zhang Yu now fully remembered that more than half of the body enhancement supplements the students took were bought from Wang Hai. [[380 旁白 neutral]]
This was a normal phenomenon at Songyang High. After all, pharmacology and physical training went hand in hand. Every PE teacher was not only an excellent body tempering expert but also an excellent medicine salesman, often with multiple pharmaceutical connections. [[381 旁白 neutral]]
But at this moment, Zhang Yu could neither afford them nor could his body handle the drugs. He could only try to brush it off. [[382 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu making excuses, Wang Hai snorted, put the medicine back, and said with a look of disappointment, "Well, suit yourself then." [[383 王海 angry]]
Watching the PE teacher turn away to instruct and sell to other students, Zhang Yu sighed helplessly and thought, "Is even PE class this hard in this damn place?" [[384 张羽 sad]]
Just then, a boy walked over and leaned in close to Zhang Yu, asking, "Did Wang Hai try to sell you stuff again?" [[385 周天翊 neutral]]
The speaker was a handsome boy with a friendly, neighborly look. [[386 旁白 neutral]]
Memories of him surfaced in Zhang Yu's mind. [[387 旁白 neutral]]
"He is... Zhou Tianyi." [[388 张羽 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi was the buddy Zhang Yu had met on the first day of school, with whom he ate and studied. [[389 旁白 neutral]]
They had eaten and studied together for three months, building a fragile friendship in the process. [[390 旁白 neutral]]
But as the memories emerged, the first thing Zhang Yu thought of was the other boy's school ranking. [[391 旁白 neutral]]
"Ranked 25th in the grade, good enough to eat at my table... Huh? Why am I being so discriminatory based on grades?" [[392 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu felt that as the memories merged, he was being influenced, paying more and more attention to the school's ranking system. [[393 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Zhou Tianyi's question, he nodded and said, "Yeah, he wanted to sell me Divine Elephant Power." [[394 张羽 neutral]]
"You didn't buy it again?" Seeing Zhang Yu nod, Zhou Tianyi hissed, "Aren't you afraid old Wang will give you a hard time?" [[395 周天翊 neutral]]
"A hard time?" Zhang Yu said, "It's just not buying medicine. It won't get that bad, will it?" [[396 张羽 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi shook his head repeatedly. "Sigh, do you want to hear a rumor about Wang Hai?" [[397 周天翊 neutral]]
"Forget it, I'm not one for gossip." [[398 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu turned and walked toward the exercise equipment, intending to get familiar with his body and the PE curriculum. [[399 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi continued, "A teacher complained that Wang Hai was masturbating in the next office, and the force of his ejaculation cracked the ceiling." [[400 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu stopped in his tracks. He wasn't a gossip, but such a ridiculous rumor... he had to see what was really going on. [[401 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi said, "Wang Hai later explained that he didn't do it. The banging sounds were him disciplining a disobedient student." [[402 周天翊 neutral]]
"Later, I asked students from the two previous years, and it turns out Wang Hai has a history of giving corporal punishment to underachieving students." [[403 周天翊 neutral]]
"Especially if their grades drop and they don't buy his medicine, he'll lead the bullying against them." [[404 周天翊 neutral]]
"I heard a student was even driven to jump off a building a few years ago." [[405 周天翊 neutral]]
Hearing the words "jump off a building," Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened. "And Wang Hai got away with that?" [[406 张羽 angry]]
Zhou Tianyi said casually, "Wang Hai's teaching results have always been excellent. He's a star PE teacher at Songyang High. He has coached three students who got first place in the city for Physical Strength on the college entrance exam. Some say he has channels to get drugs that are still in the labs of the major sects." [[407 周天翊 neutral]]
"Even if the school wanted to get rid of him, most students and parents wouldn't agree. They all rely on Wang Hai for medicine to improve their Physical Strength." [[408 周天翊 neutral]]
With that, he looked at Zhang Yu and warned, "If you keep refusing to buy medicine and your grades don't improve, you'll probably be targeted by him too." [[409 周天翊 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu frowning, Zhou Tianyi asked curiously, "I say... you used to take a lot of shots. Why did you suddenly stop? Don't tell me you're out of money? Want me to lend you some?" [[410 周天翊 neutral]]
Feeling the sincerity in his eyes, Zhang Yu just smiled helplessly. "No need." [[411 张羽 sad]]
"Really?" Zhou Tianyi said, "How about you use mine for today?" [[412 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu naturally shook his head again and again. He was genuinely afraid a few more shots would kill him on the spot. [[413 旁白 neutral]]
According to his memories, the world was full of people who were seriously injured, disabled, or even died from drug overdose. Even at Songyang High, students were severely injured every year from using too many drugs. [[414 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, the stream of students using drugs to pursue Physical Strength was endless. [[415 旁白 neutral]]
And his original self had been showing signs of being overwhelmed since last week. [[416 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking about how the original Zhang Yu not only left him with a seven-hundred-thousand-dollar debt but also this broken body, Zhang Yu sighed in despair again. [[417 旁白 neutral]]
Just as they were whispering, a cold gaze suddenly swept over them. Wang Hai shouted, "No talking during PE class." [[418 王海 angry]]
Zhang Yu and Zhou Tianyi immediately stopped talking and started their exercises. [[419 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu went to a large iron ball, tensed his muscles, and with a sudden burst of strength, lifted the hundred-kilogram ball. [[420 旁白 neutral]]
Then, as his muscles contracted and expanded, he moved the large iron ball around his body as if it were a toy. [[421 旁白 neutral]]
As the iron ball moved up and down, spinning, Zhang Yu felt the blood rush through his body, and his body parts gradually warmed up. [[422 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the warm-up..." [[423 张羽 neutral]]
The whole process felt as if it were instinctively carved into his flesh and blood. Zhang Yu completed the warm-up training almost without thinking. [[424 旁白 neutral]]
In the following training, his control over this body deepened, and related memories continuously surfaced in his mind. [[425 旁白 neutral]]
"Body tempering in the Qi Refining stage is mainly about strengthening muscles and bones, breaking limits through repeated practice to ultimately raise the Physical Strength level." [[426 旁白 neutral]]
"The specific method... for example, the most widespread one among high school students, is the technique called the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms." [[427 旁白 neutral]]
The Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms was a body tempering technique created by the Ten Great Sects specifically for high school teaching. Its thirty-six movements, combined with different equipment, could fully develop the body and effectively increase Physical Strength. [[428 旁白 neutral]]
In the cultivation framework summarized by the Ten Great Sects, all martial arts and techniques were graded from level 1 to 100. [[429 旁白 neutral]]
Most students at Songyang High could master basic martial arts like the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms to level 1 after one or two weeks of practice. [[430 旁白 neutral]]
And if one could continue to increase its level, the training effect of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms would become stronger and more incredible. [[431 旁白 neutral]]
But this was clearly not easy. In Zhang Yu's memory, only Bai Zhenzhen had managed to raise the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms to level 2 in the three months since school started. [[432 旁白 neutral]]
It was precisely because of this that Bai Zhenzhen, with just nine shots a day, could maintain her Physical Strength rank at second in the entire grade, closely chasing Qian Shen, who took 16 shots a day. [[433 旁白 neutral]]
"The level of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms affects the efficiency of Physical Strength improvement, but what truly determines the amount of power and the PE grade is still Physical Strength itself." [[434 旁白 neutral]]
"Speaking of which, with my Physical Strength at 0.82, I can casually toss around things weighing hundreds of pounds. The maximum Physical Strength in the Qi Refining realm is level 10, and after Foundation Establishment, it can reach level 20... The gap between people is too big." [[435 张羽 neutral]]
At first, Zhang Yu just wanted to train casually to get familiar with the PE curriculum and his own body. [[436 旁白 neutral]]
But as he went through the sets of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, he became more and more serious and meticulous, as if an instinct in his body was urging him on, encouraging him to persevere. [[437 旁白 neutral]]
His muscles were constantly torn, his bones were repeatedly impacted. After countless repetitions, his body, having been repeatedly ravaged, finally produced a warm current that began to silently repair the damage in his flesh and blood. [[438 旁白 neutral]]
This was Zhang Yu's mana. And just like in the PE classes of the past few months, his body was ravaged under heavy pressure, then constantly repaired by mana, becoming stronger in the process. [[439 旁白 neutral]]
Phew! [[440 旁白 neutral]]
Two hours passed in a flash. Zhang Yu let out a long breath, feeling sore all over, as if his flesh and blood were about to fall apart. [[441 旁白 neutral]]
"No wonder painkillers are necessary..." [[442 张羽 neutral]]
He looked up at Bai Zhenzhen, who was still sweating profusely in the distance, and the other classmates who were also training frantically. A sense of urgency instinctively rose in his heart, seeming to urge him to push his body even further. [[443 旁白 neutral]]
"If I trained this crazily in my original world, I probably would have died, right?" [[444 张羽 neutral]]
"It's only because of the support from various cultivation drugs and mana here... that I can endure this and even get stronger." [[445 张羽 neutral]]
Feeling the pain from all over his body and the instinct that still craved training and becoming stronger, Zhang Yu couldn't help but marvel at the deep obsession of the original Zhang Yu. [[446 旁白 neutral]]
However, as the training continued, this instinct hidden deep within the body seemed to be fading. [[447 旁白 neutral]]
The future path would ultimately have to be chosen by the current Zhang Yu. [[448 旁白 neutral]]
By the time the morning PE class was over, Zhang Yu was exhausted on the floor, surrounded by a group of classmates who were still full of energy and crazily cultivating. [[449 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu sighed at the difference between using drugs and not. [[450 张羽 neutral]]
Suddenly, he glimpsed the black patch on his palm and noticed that the part not yet filled with black was less than a quarter. [[451 旁白 neutral]]
