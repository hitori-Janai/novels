Chapter 5: The Feather Book [[584 旁白 neutral]]
As the black symbol in his palm shifted, a thick, ink-black book appeared in Zhang Yu's hand. [[585 旁白 neutral]]
"The Feather Book?" [[586 张羽 neutral]]
Looking at the two large characters on the cover, Zhang Yu felt a flicker of surprise. [[587 旁白 neutral]]
With a mere thought from him, the black book opened by itself to the first page. [[588 旁白 neutral]]
"This must be the table of contents?" [[589 张羽 neutral]]
He looked at the table of contents. Besides the first line, "Prologue," all the following lines were blurry and unreadable, as if they had been censored. [[590 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought, "Does this mean only the prologue is available for now?" [[591 张羽 neutral]]
With a thought, he turned to the prologue. Before him was a portrait on the left page and lines of data on the right page. [[592 旁白 neutral]]
"Is this a drawing of me?" [[593 张羽 neutral]]
The portrait on the left page was of himself, sitting cross-legged with his eyes gently closed, as if meditating. [[594 旁白 neutral]]
It was so lifelike that it seemed the figure in the painting was actually breathing. [[595 旁白 neutral]]
A faint light flowed within it, and Zhang Yu sensed it must represent the flow of mana inside his body. [[596 旁白 neutral]]
On the right page were lines of data: [[597 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu [[598 旁白 neutral]]
Dao Heart: Level 1 [[599 旁白 neutral]]
Mana [[600 旁白 neutral]]
Physical Strength: Level 0.83 [[601 旁白 neutral]]
Martial Arts: Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 1, Free-Form Fighting Level 1 [[602 旁白 neutral]]
Dao Arts: Basic Breathing Technique Level 1, Basic Heart-Refining Technique Level 1 [[603 旁白 neutral]]
"This is me?" [[604 张羽 neutral]]
"These are the stats for my cultivation qualities. The Dao Heart level is the same as the school's test; it can't be measured to a decimal point." [[605 张羽 neutral]]
"And below are the martial and Dao arts I've learned so far?" [[606 张羽 neutral]]
Among the four skills, besides the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms for increasing physical strength, there was also Free-Form Fighting for practical combat from martial arts class, the Basic Breathing Technique for refining mana from mana class, and the Basic Heart-Refining Technique for improving the Dao Heart. All were at the beginner's Level 1. [[607 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the numbers, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Is this the potential the Evil God unlocked? This book can detect all my attributes?" [[608 张羽 neutral]]
"But... that can't be all, right?" [[609 张羽 neutral]]
"According to the Evil God, it unlocked my potential. But what kind of potential is just detection? I get tested at school every day." [[610 张羽 neutral]]
"There must be some other use." [[611 张羽 neutral]]
Thinking this, Zhang Yu decided to test it. He focused his attention on the attribute numbers and shouted in his mind, "Feather Book! Add points for me!" [[612 张羽 neutral]]
Seeing the data on the book remained unchanged, Zhang Yu sighed. This Evil God was useless; it hadn't unlocked his potential at all. [[613 旁白 neutral]]
He tried to turn to the next page, only to find the words 'To be continued' written there. [[614 旁白 neutral]]
Recalling the unrevealed contents in the table of contents, Zhang Yu guessed, "What does this mean? Can this ability be upgraded? And the later functions will only be available after upgrading?" [[615 张羽 neutral]]
He could only turn back to the previous page, focusing his attention on his data and skills to see if he could trigger any effect. [[616 旁白 neutral]]
Just as he focused on 'Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 1', he suddenly felt the line of text twitch. It was dragged directly and moved around the page with his thoughts. [[617 旁白 neutral]]
As Zhang Yu dragged 'Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 1' across the page, wondering what its use was. [[618 旁白 neutral]]
When 'Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 1' touched the portrait, it suddenly froze and was absorbed by the Zhang Yu in the portrait. [[619 旁白 neutral]]
With this absorption, Zhang Yu felt a cool stream pour down from the top of his head. An indescribable feeling arose in his heart, making him feel a strange connection with the Zhang Yu in the portrait. [[620 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the originally seated portrait suddenly stood up and began to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, move by move. [[621 旁白 neutral]]
And above the portrait, a line of small text appeared: Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 1 [[622 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the small '+' at the end, Zhang Yu became excited, "Here it is! My potential has really been unlocked!" [[623 张羽 happy]]
His attention quickly focused on the '+'. It felt as if he had pressed it with his mind. [[624 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, the '+' blurred slightly and then turned into '(0/10)'. [[625 旁白 neutral]]
Then, an understanding arose in Zhang Yu's mind: practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms ten times to upgrade the martial art. [[626 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at 'Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 1 (0/10)' on the Feather Book, Zhang Yu was surprised, "I can upgrade this martial art just by practicing it ten times?" [[627 张羽 happy]]
Since school started, Zhang Yu had practiced the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms many times, but he had never felt any sign of an upgrade. [[628 旁白 neutral]]
"Ten times?" [[629 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu eagerly began to try. He took a step forward, and with a loud bang, his muscles twisted like a giant python, releasing waves of power. [[630 旁白 neutral]]
Although Zhang Yu used equipment to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms at school, that was only to enhance the training effect. [[631 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, as the most basic body-refining martial art, the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms could be practiced with or without equipment. The practitioner could even focus on different aspects like strength, speed, or agility according to their preference. [[632 旁白 neutral]]
For example, the original Zhang Yu had chosen a balanced development of strength and speed, without becoming a muscle-bound oaf. [[633 旁白 neutral]]
Now, Zhang Yu moved back and forth in the small room, his feet making thudding sounds on the floor, and his muscles gradually warming up after repeatedly expanding and contracting. [[634 旁白 neutral]]
But before he could practice a few moves, angry shouts came from the surroundings, "Are you crazy?! Tearing down the house in the middle of the night?!" [[635 陌生人 angry]]
Zhang Yu stopped immediately, thinking helplessly, "The soundproofing in this rental is too poor. I can't practice martial arts at night." [[636 张羽 sad]]
Looking at the Feather Book that appeared in his palm, Zhang Yu couldn't contain his excitement. He wanted to train hard right away, to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms ten times in one go to see the effect. [[637 旁白 neutral]]
"Should I find another place?" [[638 张羽 neutral]]
"I remember there's an abandoned, unfinished building nearby..." [[639 张羽 neutral]]
... [[640 旁白 neutral]]
In the darkness. [[641 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of thuds echoed in the corridor of the unfinished building. [[642 旁白 neutral]]
As the neon lights from the distant street flickered, the figure of a young man appeared and disappeared in the shadows. [[643 旁白 neutral]]
It was Zhang Yu, who had come to the unfinished building to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[644 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, his gaze was serious as he practiced the exercises of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. Soon, he was drenched in sweat, steam rising from his body. [[645 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu had already exercised all morning and collapsed on the ground. Without the help of injections, pills, or dietary supplements, he felt sore all over as he practiced the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. Every movement and exertion brought a tearing pain to his muscles. [[646 旁白 neutral]]
But thinking of the changes in the Feather Book, his spirits lifted, and he persisted in finishing one round of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[647 旁白 neutral]]
Panting heavily, Zhang Yu eagerly opened his palm, and the Feather Book appeared again with his thought. [[648 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at 'Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 1 (1/10)' on it, a happy smile appeared on Zhang Yu's face. [[649 张羽 happy]]
"Is this my potential?" [[650 张羽 neutral]]
"Upgrading the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms to Level 2... it seems really possible." [[651 张羽 happy]]
"I'm going to practice ten times tonight!" [[652 张羽 happy]]
Zhang Yu eagerly started the second round of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[653 旁白 neutral]]
But a moment later, he collapsed to the ground, exhausted, feeling as if his arms and legs were no longer his own. [[654 旁白 neutral]]
"I can't go on, I've reached my limit. Looks like I'll have to try again tomorrow." [[655 张羽 sad]]
Just as Zhang Yu decided to stop training, rest a bit, and then go home for a good sleep, a sudden chill rose in his heart. [[656 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, a voice echoed in his mind. [[657 旁白 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement, work hard to fulfill your wish, and do not deliberately slack off or delay. 10." [[658 邪神 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement, work hard to fulfill your wish, and do not deliberately slack off or delay. 9." [[659 邪神 neutral]]
"Please abide by the ritual's agreement, work hard to fulfill your wish, and do not deliberately slack off or delay. 8." [[660 邪神 neutral]]
As the voice continued its countdown, the chill in Zhang Yu's heart grew stronger, as if something was about to burst out from his body and tear him apart. [[661 旁白 neutral]]
"Ritual... agreement... wish..." He immediately understood, "Is this the power of that God-Summoning Ritual?" [[662 张羽 neutral]]
The words the doll had said flashed through Zhang Yu's mind. [[663 旁白 neutral]]
... [[664 旁白 neutral]]
"If you choose to refuse to fulfill my wish, or deliberately delay or fail in the process, you will suffer from the ritual's backlash, your body will explode, and your soul will scatter." [[665 邪神 angry]]
... [[666 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought, "So... it's because I plan to fulfill the second wish by studying hard, getting into a top university, joining a major sect, and earning money." [[667 张羽 neutral]]
"So, slacking off in this process is considered deliberately being lazy and delaying the fulfillment of the wish?" [[668 张羽 neutral]]
"If I don't listen, will I die from the ritual's backlash?" [[669 张羽 sad]]
Hearing the countdown had already reached 3, Zhang Yu quickly jumped up. [[670 旁白 neutral]]
With a cry of pain, he forced himself to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, enduring the tearing pain in his muscles. [[671 旁白 neutral]]
The moment he began to practice, the countdown disappeared completely. [[672 旁白 neutral]]
