Chapter 14: Preparations and a New Job [[1459 旁白 neutral]]
The stationery stores near school entrances always sell all sorts of things that students need. [[1460 旁白 neutral]]
The one outside Songyang High School was no different. [[1461 旁白 neutral]]
Besides various school supplies, the huge display cabinet behind the owner looked like a pharmacy, filled with all the drugs a high schooler might need, from sedatives and stimulants to focus potions. [[1462 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu leaned on the counter with both hands and asked, "Boss, do you have any Neuro-Fillers?" [[1463 张羽 neutral]]
The owner, scrolling on his phone, replied without looking up, "Do you want the expensive kind or the cheap kind?" [[1464 老板 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "I'm a student. Can you sell me the expensive one for a bit cheaper?" [[1465 张羽 neutral]]
The owner finally looked up, giving Zhang Yu a sideways glance. [[1466 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu said nonchalantly, "I'm tenth in the first year, Class 1, a campus celebrity. If your potions work well for me, my classmates will definitely follow me here to buy them." [[1467 张羽 neutral]]
The owner's mouth twitched. He pulled a box of medicine from the cabinet and placed it in front of Zhang Yu. "Neuro-Filler from Ziyun Corporation. Guarantees you'll only need 20 minutes of sleep a day. 500 a box. I'll sell it to you for 480 this time." [[1468 老板 neutral]]
Zhang Yu picked up the box and looked at it. "Aren't you going to throw in something extra?" [[1469 张羽 neutral]]
The owner frowned, took out a few painkillers, and said, "Here, take these for free." [[1470 老板 neutral]]
Zhang Yu chuckled, stuffed the painkillers in his pocket, and said, "Thanks, boss. In that case, can I pass on the Neuro-Filler?" [[1471 张羽 happy]]
Seeing the owner's face darken, Zhang Yu scanned the payment QR code nearby. "Just kidding. Paying you now." [[1472 张羽 happy]]
Picking up the Neuro-Filler from the counter, Zhang Yu felt a pang of regret. [[1473 旁白 sad]]
A box like this would only last a week, but it cost him a full 480. His account balance instantly dropped to just over seventeen hundred. [[1474 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu believed it was all worth it. [[1475 旁白 neutral]]
After all, since he'd decided to enter the Cultivation Tournament, Zhang Yu planned to give it his all. He would go without sleep for the next week, focusing entirely on practicing the Circadian Qi-Gathering Technique. [[1476 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh, my goal isn't just to be in the top ten." [[1477 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Zhao Tianxing walked into the stationery store and watched Zhang Yu buy the medicine and leave. He wondered, "Is it really a Neuro-Filler?" [[1478 旁白 neutral]]
He followed Zhang Yu out of the store and down the street. When they reached a corner, he was startled to find Zhang Yu already standing there, waiting for him. [[1479 旁白 neutral]]
"Uh... hello, Zhang Yu," Zhao Tianxing said awkwardly. "What a coincidence, you take this road too?" [[1480 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked at him and asked, "Why are you following me?" [[1481 张羽 angry]]
Zhao Tianxing scratched his head, playing dumb. "Following you? I always take this road after school." [[1482 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu said impatiently, "Just look at yourself." [[1483 张羽 angry]]
"You're over two meters tall and weigh more than three hundred pounds. I saw you the moment I left the cafeteria." [[1484 张羽 angry]]
"What do you really want?" [[1485 张羽 angry]]
Zhao Tianxing couldn't possibly tell him that the PE teacher, Wang Hai, had asked him to get close to Zhang Yu and find out where he was getting his supplies. [[1486 旁白 neutral]]
So, Zhao Tianxing scratched his head again and said shyly, "Zhang Yu, I think you're really amazing. I want to follow you and learn from you." [[1487 赵天行 neutral]]
Seeing the bashful expression on the sixteen-year-old, 300-pound boy, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Are... are your social skills still at an elementary school level?" [[1488 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought for a moment and said, "Alright. Just buy me some fried chicken, and you can follow me around all you want." [[1489 张羽 neutral]]
Feeling a chill run through his body and the countdown timer in his head urging him on, Zhang Yu knew he couldn't stay any longer. [[1490 旁白 neutral]]
He walked forward helplessly and waved. "Let's talk as we walk." [[1491 张羽 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing followed behind Zhang Yu, hesitating. "You want to eat fried chicken? That's terrible for body-strengthening. Teacher Wang told us not to eat it. Can we get grilled chicken breast instead?" [[1492 赵天行 neutral]]
"Don't worry, I'm not asking you to eat it. You just have to buy it for me." Thinking of the taste of fried chicken, Zhang Yu couldn't help but wipe the corner of his mouth. [[1493 张羽 happy]]
Ever since coming to this world, he had eaten three cheap, healthy meals a day at the high school cafeteria. He hadn't eaten anything like fried chicken in a long time. [[1494 旁白 sad]]
The daily hard training had built up a lot of stress, with no time to relax and no courage to spend an extra cent. [[1495 旁白 sad]]
Now, the thought of eating fried chicken made him feel much lighter, and some of the pressure seemed to melt away. [[1496 旁白 happy]]
Zhao Tianxing followed him onto the subway and off again, watching as he arrived at a fried chicken shop. He asked curiously, "We came all this way to this shop. It must be especially delicious, right?" [[1497 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Because it's on the way." [[1498 张羽 neutral]]
Unfortunately, as soon as Zhang Yu stepped into the fried chicken shop, the cursed countdown started again in his mind. [[1499 旁白 neutral]]
He could only say to Zhao Tianxing, "Buy me a fried chicken combo. I'll wait for you here." [[1500 张羽 neutral]]
Watching Zhang Yu sit down and start meditating on the spot, Zhao Tianxing scratched his head, confused about what was happening. [[1501 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, watching Zhang Yu happily munching on a fried chicken leg on the street, Zhao Tianxing felt even more puzzled. [[1502 旁白 neutral]]
"He's so disciplined that he uses the time waiting in line to practice his breathing, yet he eats fried chicken... What a strange person." [[1503 旁白 neutral]]
Following Zhang Yu, Zhao Tianxing was even more surprised to find that he wasn't going to a cram school or to buy medicine, but to a public square to wait for temporary work. [[1504 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing: "You're going to work?" [[1505 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu rubbed his stomach, found a clean spot on the ground, and sat down comfortably. He waved his hand and said, "A fried chicken meal doesn't buy you a conversation. I'm going to wait for work while I cultivate. Do as you please." [[1506 张羽 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu start his breathing exercises right there on the ground, Zhao Tianxing was stunned again. [[1507 旁白 neutral]]
"Breathing exercises?" He glanced at the nearby sewage, listened to the loud music from the barbershop across the street, and looked at the intimidating job-seekers all around. He couldn't help but ask again, "You're doing them here?" [[1508 赵天行 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu had already started to fully concentrate on practicing the Circadian Qi-Gathering Technique and ignored him this time. [[1509 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing squatted next to Zhang Yu and observed him for a while. He realized that he was genuinely practicing his breathing, and more questions bubbled up in his mind. "Is there any benefit to practicing here?" [[1510 赵天行 neutral]]
"Is it just to practice while waiting for a job?" [[1511 赵天行 neutral]]
After waiting for a while and seeing that Zhang Yu had no intention of getting up, Zhao Tianxing was thinking about leaving when his phone vibrated. [[1512 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the inquiry message from Wang Hai, Zhao Tianxing replied that he was getting close to Zhang Yu. After a long hesitation, he finally sat down next to him and also began his breathing exercises. [[1513 旁白 neutral]]
Half an hour later, Zhao Tianxing couldn't help but open his eyes. He saw that Zhang Yu was still practicing. [[1514 旁白 neutral]]
An hour later, Zhao Tianxing couldn't help but stand up, walk around, and stretch. He turned to see Zhang Yu still practicing. [[1515 旁白 neutral]]
More than two hours later, Zhao Tianxing had long stopped his breathing exercises and had started practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, one move at a time. [[1516 旁白 neutral]]
In his occasional glances, Zhang Yu remained motionless from beginning to end. He didn't even make small movements like scratching his head or bottom. Even his eyelids didn't move, and his breathing rhythm remained unchanged. [[1517 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing couldn't help but marvel, "Such high concentration. No wonder he can maintain zero distraction for days on end." [[1518 赵天行 neutral]]
"But there's no spiritual root here, no high-spirit-energy environment, and he's not on any drugs... Is there really any point in practicing with such low efficiency?" [[1519 赵天行 neutral]]
With Zhang Yu's focused cultivation, the progress of his Circadian Qi-Gathering Technique advanced again, reaching level 4 (12/80). [[1520 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, another van drove into the square. Hearing that they were looking for security guards, Zhang Yu retracted his focus and continued to cultivate. [[1521 旁白 neutral]]
A first-year high school student like him had no chance of competing for a security job against the old-timers around him. [[1522 旁白 neutral]]
But soon he heard that the recruiter was looking for someone young, in good shape, clean-cut, and with good looks. [[1523 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's eyes flew open. He strode towards the van with the confidence of a dragon and raised his hand. "How about me?" [[1524 张羽 happy]]
The driver in the van's eyes lit up and he walked towards Zhang Yu. "Excellent, excellent, I'll take you." [[1525 司机 happy]]
Zhang Yu smiled, about to shake the man's hand, but realized the man had walked past him and was grabbing Zhao Tianxing's hand with praise. "Good physique, and a handsome face too." [[1526 司机 happy]]
"This chest!" [[1527 司机 happy]]
"This waist!" [[1528 司机 happy]]
"This back!" [[1529 司机 happy]]
The driver patted Zhao Tianxing's body, exclaiming, "Simply perfect proportions. Although your absolute strength isn't there yet, the foundational frame is perfectly built, like an unpolished jade full of infinite possibilities." [[1530 司机 happy]]
"To reach this level, it's absolutely impossible without persistent hard training, an extremely disciplined lifestyle, guidance from a master teacher, and taking medicine and injections to the limit." [[1531 司机 happy]]
"You're the one, kid. I'll give you 800 an hour. Come with me." [[1532 司机 happy]]
At that moment, Zhang Yu was stunned. [[1533 旁白 neutral]]
He never expected that his lean, muscular physique, handsome, cool face, and otherworldly temperament would lose to a muscle monster like Zhao Tianxing. [[1534 旁白 sad]]
"Boss, look at me, I can do it too." [[1535 张羽 neutral]]
The driver glanced at Zhang Yu and shook his head. "No skinny guys." [[1536 司机 neutral]]
"You don't look reassuring for security. You'd probably block only half as many flying swords as him." [[1537 司机 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing opened his mouth to refuse, "Actually, I'm not here to..." [[1538 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu quickly interrupted him, "Boss, we're sworn brothers. We promised that whether it's a job for one person or a group, we do it all together." [[1539 张羽 happy]]
The driver frowned, looked at Zhang Yu, then at Zhao Tianxing, and finally asked Zhang Yu, "400 an hour for you, six hours in total. You in or out?" [[1540 司机 neutral]]
Zhang Yu nodded repeatedly, "I'm in! I'm in! I'm in!" [[1541 张羽 happy]]
Zhang Yu pulled Zhao Tianxing towards the van. [[1542 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing said to Zhang Yu awkwardly, "I'm not here to work, and my mom will worry if I get back too late. I should go talk to the boss..." [[1543 赵天行 sad]]
Zhang Yu quickly said, "Didn't you have something you wanted to talk to me about? Let's go work together, and you can talk about whatever you want." [[1544 张羽 neutral]]
Thinking about the task Wang Hai had given him, Zhao Tianxing reluctantly said, "I need to call my mom first." [[1545 赵天行 neutral]]
The van drove them towards the city center, and the driver explained their job on the way. [[1546 旁白 neutral]]
"Ms. Li Xuelian is holding an art exhibition in the Cloud Hall on the 999th floor. The security is already in place." [[1547 司机 neutral]]
"However, Ms. Li isn't satisfied with the appearance of the internal security. She's worried it will affect the viewing experience and asked us to find some handsome young lads." [[1548 司机 neutral]]
"When you two get there, change into security uniforms and follow all orders from the security captain." [[1549 司机 neutral]]
"And remember this, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely do not offend Ms. Li." [[1550 司机 neutral]]
Zhang Yu asked curiously, "This Ms. Li must be very rich, right?" [[1551 张羽 neutral]]
"Heh, rich?" the driver snorted proudly. "More than rich. Ms. Li is the daughter of a Golden Core Master!" [[1552 司机 neutral]]
