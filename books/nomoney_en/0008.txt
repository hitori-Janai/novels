Chapter 8: A Teacher's Care [[886 旁白 neutral]]
Until the end of PE class, Wang Hai completely ignored Zhang Yu, as if he were just a puff of air, offering no guidance or instruction. [[887 旁白 neutral]]
With Wang Hai leading the isolation, the other students also subconsciously avoided Zhang Yu, creating an invisible no-man's-land around him. [[888 旁白 neutral]]
"That Old Wang is so... How can he be so petty." [[889 张羽 angry]]
But since things had come to this, Zhang Yu could do nothing about it, so he simply lay down quietly on the ground to continue resting. [[890 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, class was over, and everyone gradually headed to the cafeteria. [[891 旁白 neutral]]
After everyone else had left, Zhou Tianyi walked over to Zhang Yu and gave him a thumbs-up. "Brave warrior, did you buy accident insurance?" [[892 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu slowly got up, dusted off his pants, and said, "What's there to be afraid of? Once my cultivation improves and my scores shoot up, there will be plenty of teachers backing me." [[893 张羽 happy]]
He looked confidently at the Feather Book in his palm; his Physical Strength had already increased from 0.83 to 0.84. [[894 旁白 neutral]]
And this was without any injections, medicine, or even nutritional meals, just from practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[895 旁白 neutral]]
As the level of his Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms continued to increase, his Physical Strength would improve even faster. [[896 旁白 neutral]]
Just thinking about this, Zhang Yu couldn't help but marvel again at his own terrifying potential. [[897 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu's sudden burst of confidence, Zhou Tianyi asked curiously, "Did you find a new source for drugs? Don't forget your brother if you get the good stuff." [[898 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu clenched his fist and smiled. "Kid, I'm training naturally!" [[899 张羽 happy]]
Outside the training room door, Bai Zhenzhen's face was flushed after intense training, sweat dripping from her forehead as steam rose from her body. [[900 旁白 neutral]]
Knock, knock, knock! [[901 旁白 neutral]]
She knocked on the door and said flatly, "Zhang Yu, are you done showing off? I'm hungry, let's go eat." [[902 白真真 neutral]]
The three of them hurried to join the crowd at the cafeteria. Since they were late, they could see a long line of people queuing at the entrance from a distance. [[903 旁白 neutral]]
However, as students from the Demonstration Class, the three of them had the privilege of entering the cafeteria first and could use the VIP channel to get their meals directly. [[904 旁白 neutral]]
Under the varied gazes of students from other classes, the three of them walked into the cafeteria. [[905 旁白 neutral]]
How to describe that feeling? [[906 旁白 neutral]]
If Zhang Yu were to describe it, it was like an inner sect prodigy from a novel, walking slowly into the Juxian Restaurant to dine under the gazes of outer sect servants—gazes filled with envy, jealousy, or the belief that they could take his place. [[907 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as they entered the cafeteria, Bai Zhenzhen said, "I'm having a nutritional meal today, so I'm going to the second floor to eat." [[908 白真真 neutral]]
The so-called nutritional meal involved cooking with ingredients full of cultivation elements and various medicines. It could effectively strengthen the body, recover from intense exercise, and improve the efficiency of physical training and breathing exercises. [[909 旁白 neutral]]
It could be said that nutritional meals had countless benefits for cultivation studies. The only reason Zhang Yu wasn't eating one right now was that it was too expensive. Far too expensive. [[910 旁白 sad]]
A single meal cost at least several hundred, and thousands for rarer ingredients was normal. Even when Zhang Yu had a huge loan, he couldn't afford to eat it every day, let alone now. [[911 旁白 sad]]
Watching Bai Zhenzhen go up to the second floor alone, Zhang Yu could feel that the second floor and the first floor of the cafeteria were another dividing line, just like the one between him inside the cafeteria and the queue outside. [[912 旁白 neutral]]
But a trace of doubt rose in Zhang Yu's heart. "Doesn't Ah Zhen have no money? How can she afford to go to the second floor?" [[913 张羽 neutral]]
... [[914 旁白 neutral]]
Not long after lunch, Zhang Yu, who was on his lunch break, was called to the teacher's office. [[915 旁白 neutral]]
A middle-aged man sipped his tea, glanced at Zhang Yu standing in front of his desk, and said, "Teacher Wang Hai told me about what happened with you." [[916 苏海峰 neutral]]
The man's name was Su Haifeng. He was both the head teacher of the Demonstration Class and the director for the first-year students. [[917 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at Zhang Yu with a disappointed expression and said, "Do you remember what you told me during your interview?" [[918 苏海峰 angry]]
When the original Zhang Yu had interviewed for Songyang High School, Su Haifeng had been the interviewer sitting in the middle. [[919 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Su Haifeng's words, Zhang Yu was slightly stunned. Although he had merged with the original owner's memories, many details couldn't be recalled instantly. [[920 旁白 neutral]]
Su Haifeng sighed. "I still remember you said you wanted to get into a famous university." [[921 苏海峰 angry]]
"In PE class, you don't buy medicine, you don't get injections, you lie on the ground being lazy, and you talk back to the teacher. Is this your attitude for getting into a famous university?" [[922 苏海峰 angry]]
Listening to the criticism, Zhang Yu didn't know how to explain. He couldn't just say that he couldn't afford medicine or injections because he was poor and useless, and that he was slacking in PE because his potential had been unlocked. [[923 旁白 neutral]]
Sensing Zhang Yu's silence, Su Haifeng sighed again and said, "Zhang Yu, your performance over the past three months has been good. I know you're a good kid." [[924 苏海峰 neutral]]
"Did something happen at home recently?" [[925 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked up in surprise, feeling the teacher's concerned gaze. He found it hard to believe. "In this crazy school, there's actually a teacher who cares about students?" [[926 张羽 neutral]]
He thought for a moment and said quietly, "Yes, I had a small disagreement with my family." [[927 张羽 sad]]
"I'll try to sort it out and get back on track soon." [[928 张羽 neutral]]
Although he felt the teacher's concern, Zhang Yu could only give a vague answer for now. Once his grades improved, he wouldn't have to explain these difficult things to his teacher. [[929 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Haifeng frowned as if dissatisfied, and said annoyedly, "What is there that you can't tell your teacher?" [[930 苏海峰 angry]]
"Is it that your family is having financial problems recently?" [[931 苏海峰 neutral]]
"The debt collectors from the loan companies have already called the school." [[932 苏海峰 neutral]]
"What?" Zhang Yu's head snapped up. "They called you, teacher?" [[933 张羽 neutral]]
Su Haifeng nodded gravely. "If they hadn't called me, I wouldn't have known you owe so much money. Why didn't you tell me?" [[934 苏海峰 neutral]]
"I..." [[935 张羽 neutral]]
He truly hadn't thought that telling the school would be of any use, especially with the culture at Songyang High. He figured it would only make his situation worse. [[936 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Haifeng let out a long sigh and looked at Zhang Yu with a kind expression. "I know the school can be strict sometimes, and you were afraid to tell us when something went wrong." [[937 苏海峰 neutral]]
"But you have to know that we are your teachers, after all. How could we not help our own students?" [[938 苏海峰 neutral]]
As he spoke, he pulled a document out of his drawer and handed it to Zhang Yu. [[939 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a financial aid plan for needy students that I specially applied for you. Sign it quickly." [[940 苏海峰 happy]]
Taking the document, Zhang Yu looked at Su Haifeng, moved. "Teacher, thank you." [[941 张羽 happy]]
He realized his opinion of the teachers at this school was wrong again. [[942 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Although there are unreliable guys like Wang Hai, there are also kind elders like Teacher Su." [[943 张羽 happy]]
Su Haifeng smiled and waved his hand, passing him a pen. "Go on, sign it." [[944 苏海峰 happy]]
Zhang Yu lowered his head, his eyes sweeping over the document, and then he froze. [[945 旁白 neutral]]
Su Haifeng chuckled. "What's wrong? Sign it quickly. I'll try to submit it for you before I leave work." [[946 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's voice was low. "Teacher, this seems to be a debt restructuring contract. Did you grab the wrong one?" [[947 张羽 sad]]
Su Haifeng chuckled. "The reason needy students are needy is because they're in debt, right? After restructuring the debt, doesn't that help the needy student? This is the financial aid plan for needy students." [[948 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked at the contract's contents. It basically consolidated all his debts, and the school would lend him a sum of money to pay them off. [[949 旁白 neutral]]
From then on, his creditor would be the school. [[950 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu estimated the debt after the restructuring. After all sorts of miscellaneous fees, interest, principal, handling fees, and upfront deductions... it seemed the total had risen to over a million. [[951 旁白 neutral]]
"What debt restructuring! This is just using a new loan to pay off an old one." [[952 张羽 angry]]
He roared inwardly, "Even the head teacher is a loan shark?" [[953 张羽 angry]]
"So this is how they play? Is there not a single normal teacher in this rotten school?" [[954 张羽 angry]]
Suppressing his anger, Zhang Yu let out a breath and said, "Teacher, I think I'll pass. I can repay this money myself." [[955 张羽 neutral]]
Su Haifeng persuaded him earnestly, "How can a kid like you repay such a large sum? Hurry up and sign. The school will bear this burden for you." [[956 苏海峰 neutral]]
"Don't worry, the school's installment plan is very flexible." [[957 苏海峰 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "No, thank you, teacher. Really, I don't need it." [[958 张羽 neutral]]
After refusing several times, Zhang Yu simply tossed the contract aside and ran out of the office. [[959 旁白 neutral]]
Watching his departing figure, Su Haifeng raised his teacup and blew on it lightly. [[960 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, he picked up his vibrating phone and said, "He refused." [[961 苏海峰 neutral]]
"Yes, I'll try again in a while." [[962 苏海峰 neutral]]
"Don't worry. He's poor... eventually he won't be able to handle the collection agency's methods. He'll come to borrow." [[963 苏海峰 neutral]]
