Chapter 4: The God-Summoning Ritual [[453 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the change on his palm, Zhang Yu couldn't help but think, "What does this mean?" [[454 张羽 neutral]]
"Will I die after it's completely filled?" [[455 张羽 sad]]
Unfortunately, no one could answer the unease in Zhang Yu's heart. [[456 旁白 neutral]]
After finishing the morning physical education class, Zhang Yu dragged his half-dead body to lunch with Bai Zhenzhen and Zhou Tianyi, then rested for a moment before the afternoon classes began. [[457 旁白 neutral]]
The first class in the afternoon was history, taught by an old man with white hair. [[458 旁白 neutral]]
After entering the classroom, the old man sat down behind the teacher's desk and began to lecture casually from his book. [[459 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't seem to care whether the students below were resting, meditating, cultivating, or even leaving the classroom for physical training. [[460 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu wasn't interested in the history teacher's lecture either. He just quickly flipped through the textbook, recalling its contents in his mind and combining it with his own memories to understand it. [[461 旁白 neutral]]
"There are no countries in Kunxu; everything is monopolized and controlled by the Ten Great Sects. Kunxu has thirty-six floors above ground. The first floor is about the size of two Chinas and is made up of cities of various sizes, each managed by a city government set up by a major sect." [[462 旁白 neutral]]
"Besides the cultivation-related aspects, the technology on the first floor seems to be about the same as in my previous life, but the lives of ordinary people seem much harder." [[463 旁白 neutral]]
"The first floor of Kunxu is also where the original Zhang Yu had always lived. As for the floors above... he had only seen them on TV and in movies." [[464 旁白 neutral]]
According to Zhang Yu's memory, you could only enter the second floor of Kunxu by getting into a university, and only by graduating and joining a major sect could you go even higher. [[465 旁白 neutral]]
It could be said that within Kunxu, only by mastering stronger cultivation powers and having higher authority could one climb up step by step. [[466 旁白 neutral]]
And the higher the floor, the more abundant the spiritual energy was said to be, the more advanced the cultivation technology, and the more plentiful the resources. [[467 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Zhang Yu couldn't help but look out the window, feeling the sunlight pouring down. [[468 旁白 neutral]]
"Such a real sky and sunlight... Is this place really inside some kind of giant structure?" [[469 张羽 neutral]]
"The first floor alone is the size of two Chinas, so how much space does the entire Kunxu take up? It can't be on Earth, right?" [[470 张羽 neutral]]
"How did I even get to this world?" [[471 张羽 neutral]]
He unconsciously recalled the scene of his arrival in this world, thought of the strange ritual, and his head felt dizzy again. [[472 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu quickly shook his head. For him at this moment, things like high school grades, living expenses, making money, and PE class needed his attention more than these big questions. [[473 旁白 neutral]]
And thinking of grades and cultivation, Zhang Yu felt another headache coming on. [[474 旁白 neutral]]
Besides the morning PE class, his cultivation scores were divided into four subjects: Dao Heart, Mana, Martial Arts, and Magical Arts. [[475 旁白 neutral]]
Dao Heart was worth 150 points, Mana was 150 points, Martial Arts was 100 points, and Magical Arts was 100 points. [[476 旁白 neutral]]
And according to his memory, his recent rankings had been slipping in every area; not a single subject was improving. [[477 旁白 neutral]]
If this continued, it seemed to be only a matter of time before he was expelled from Songyang High School. [[478 旁白 neutral]]
Another question popped into Zhang Yu's mind. [[479 旁白 neutral]]
"From the looks of it, Zhang Yu's family isn't rich, and he doesn't have any outstanding cultivation talent. Both his first and second-year interviews weren't very successful, so how did he get into Songyang High School?" [[480 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought back repeatedly, only remembering that the original owner of the body entered Songyang High School with less-than-ideal interview results. [[481 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of the original owner's family, his eyes moved slightly as he took out his phone and opened the contacts. [[482 旁白 neutral]]
"Right, should I contact Zhang Yu's parents and sister after school?" [[483 张羽 neutral]]
During the afternoon classes, Zhang Yu spent his time reviewing and organizing his memories, which deepened his understanding of the knowledge in his mind, this world, and his identity as Zhang Yu. [[484 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, it was six o'clock, time for school to end. [[485 旁白 neutral]]
The school's classes for the day were over, but for most students at Songyang High School, only half the day's lessons were done. They still had their respective tutoring sessions to attend, followed by self-study until late at night before they could rest. [[486 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike his classmates who were rushing to their tutoring classes, Zhang Yu was sitting in the empty cafeteria. [[487 旁白 neutral]]
With no savings and no borrowing limit left, he had stopped attending tutoring two weeks ago. [[488 旁白 neutral]]
So after finishing dinner, he thought for a moment and turned on his phone. [[489 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's give it a try." [[490 张羽 neutral]]
He first called Zhang Yu's mother, then his father, but neither of them answered. [[491 旁白 neutral]]
Recalling the memories of Zhang Yu's parents and sister, he finally, reluctantly, called his sister. [[492 旁白 neutral]]
"Zhang Yu?" [[493 姐姐 neutral]]
Hearing the slightly cold voice on the other end of the phone, Zhang Yu braced himself and said, "Sister, can I borrow some money?" [[494 张羽 neutral]]
There was a moment of silence. Just as Zhang Yu thought she would hang up, a voice came from the phone: "When you were in the first grade of elementary school, I told Mom and Dad that you have no talent for cultivation. Going down this path is a complete waste of time and money." [[495 姐姐 angry]]
"After we separated, Mom believed in your fantasy and insisted on supporting you through high school alone. She even came to us for money not long ago, trying to use my tutoring fees." [[496 姐姐 angry]]
"Heh, and in the end, you foolishly took out loans for cultivation? To study in high school, you must be deep in debt by now, right?" [[497 姐姐 angry]]
Faced with her accusations, Zhang Yu had nothing to say, because according to the memories he had sorted through, she wasn't wrong. [[498 旁白 neutral]]
After their parents separated, each taking one child, the original Zhang Yu, knowing his mother's income was low and they had no money, recklessly pursued cultivation, taking out small loans and getting trapped in a cycle of debt. [[499 旁白 neutral]]
And his mother, after repeatedly helping him repay his loans only to find the hole getting bigger and bigger, finally left him. [[500 旁白 neutral]]
The voice on the phone continued. [[501 姐姐 neutral]]
"This is the last time we'll talk. You can pay back your own debts." [[502 姐姐 angry]]
"Here's some advice: drop out of school and get a job to pay off your debt." [[503 姐姐 neutral]]
"For the sake of us once being family, I'll send you 500. That should be enough for you to find a job before you starve." [[504 姐姐 neutral]]
Hearing the phone hang up, Zhang Yu sighed helplessly. "Well, at least I got 500." [[505 张羽 sad]]
With the 500 from Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu's savings finally exceeded 1000. [[506 旁白 neutral]]
But walking home, his sister's advice kept replaying in his mind. [[507 旁白 neutral]]
"Drop out and get a job?" [[508 张羽 sad]]
Lying on the bed in his rented room, Zhang Yu stared blankly at the slightly moldy ceiling. [[509 旁白 neutral]]
Falling grades, no money, massive debt, a body on the verge of collapse... he had to admit that dropping out and getting a job seemed like a rational decision. [[510 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a sharp pain shot from his palm. The symbol only he could see was finally filled with black. [[511 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, a clear female voice sounded from the side, "Kid, the God-Summoning Ritual is complete. Time to grant three wishes." [[512 邪神 neutral]]
Zhang Yu whipped his head around and saw a cloth doll sitting on his bed. [[513 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the doll with its faded yellow cloth and crooked stitches that looked like they could split open at any moment, he suddenly realized—wasn't this the doll he saw during the strange ritual on the rooftop when he first arrived in this world? [[514 旁白 neutral]]
Doll: "Hey, did you hear me? Three wishes, not one less." [[515 邪神 neutral]]
Faced with this strange scene, Zhang Yu just wanted to leave. [[516 旁白 neutral]]
He was no longer the clueless newcomer he had been. [[517 旁白 neutral]]
After organizing his memories, he knew that gods in this world weren't just vague beliefs; they were the administrators managing countless affairs within Kunxu. [[518 旁白 neutral]]
But these official gods were not beings that a cultivation failure like him could summon casually. The deity summoned by his so-called God-Summoning Ritual must be one of the legendary Evil Gods who caused chaos, took lives indiscriminately, and were strictly suppressed by the Ten Great Sects and the official gods. [[519 旁白 neutral]]
Stories of mortals making deals with Evil Gods and ending up dead with their souls scattered were tales that the common folk of Kunxu's first floor grew up hearing. [[520 旁白 neutral]]
"This guy Zhang Yu was so desperate that he turned to an Evil God?" [[521 张羽 sad]]
"No wonder I get a headache whenever I think about related memories. Is this also a trick of the Evil God?" [[522 张羽 sad]]
Zhang Yu's first instinct was to run away from the danger, but on second thought, he stopped his trembling body. [[523 旁白 neutral]]
The original Zhang Yu had turned to an Evil God only because he truly had no other choice. [[524 旁白 neutral]]
Should he work like an animal at the bottom of society for the rest of his life to pay off his debt, or risk his life for a chance to continue cultivating? [[525 旁白 neutral]]
"Evil God! My first wish is for you to grant me 100 wishes!" [[526 张羽 happy]]
After saying that, Zhang Yu swallowed nervously and looked at the doll, asking, "You can do that, right?" [[527 张羽 neutral]]
"Haha, of course I can do something so simple." [[528 邪神 happy]]
Seeing the smile on Zhang Yu's face, the doll let out a sneer, "But I choose... not to." [[529 邪神 angry]]
"Because after the God-Summoning Ritual is complete, it is you who must grant my three wishes." [[530 邪神 neutral]]
"If you choose to refuse, or deliberately delay or fail in the process, you will suffer the ritual's backlash and your flesh will explode, your soul will scatter." [[531 邪神 angry]]
"Alright, my first wish is for you to grant me another 1000 wishes." [[532 邪神 happy]]
Hearing this, Zhang Yu was stunned and cursed inwardly, "What... I went through this whole God-Summoning Ritual just to grant your wishes? Is this Zhang Yu an idiot? 1000 wishes? Is that even possible?" [[533 张羽 angry]]
After stating its first wish, the doll smiled, its empty black button eyes staring straight at Zhang Yu. [[534 邪神 neutral]]
"Are you ready? I'm about to make my next wish." [[535 邪神 neutral]]
Hearing this, Zhang Yu's heart tightened. "What kind of wish is this thing going to make now?" [[536 张羽 sad]]
"If I really have to grant it a thousand wishes, won't I become its slave?" [[537 张羽 sad]]
"Or... what if it makes a wish I can't possibly fulfill... Won't I be doomed to die?" [[538 张羽 sad]]
The doll said slowly, "I've thought about it. My next wish is... for you to help me collect some antiques." [[539 邪神 neutral]]
Zhang Yu swallowed. "Antiques?" [[540 张羽 neutral]]
The doll giggled and said, "Don't worry, I've already found them for you. Just buy everything in your shopping cart." [[541 邪神 happy]]
Zhang Yu paused, then took out his phone. Following his memory, he opened his shopping cart and found it filled with various Buddha statues, altars, incense burners, wooden swords... The prices were steep; any single item cost tens of thousands. [[542 旁白 neutral]]
And if he couldn't afford these antiques, it seemed he couldn't fulfill the wish. If he couldn't fulfill the Evil God's wish, wouldn't he die a violent death under the effect of the ritual? [[543 旁白 sad]]
Thinking of this, Zhang Yu quickly asked, "Could you please consider a different wish?" [[544 张羽 sad]]
"I'm afraid I can't afford so many antiques." [[545 张羽 sad]]
"Making excuses..." The doll's gaze hardened, endless malice pouring from its black-hole eyes. "Are you trying to go back on your word? If you can't afford it, borrow. If you can't borrow, sell your heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, and lungs. There's always a way to get the money." [[546 邪神 angry]]
Zhang Yu looked at the doll seriously and said slowly, "If I do that, I'll die just to fulfill this one wish, won't I?" [[547 张羽 neutral]]
The doll chuckled lightly, "So what?" [[548 邪神 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "You are choosing to immediately lose someone who will grant you a thousand wishes in the future." [[549 张羽 neutral]]
"Or will you give me some time, and let a future disciple of a Great Sect buy these antiques for you, and then one by one... help you fulfill those thousand wishes?" [[550 张羽 neutral]]
"Hmm?" The doll gave Zhang Yu a surprised look. "Continue." [[551 邪神 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "I've calculated it. To buy all these antiques, I probably couldn't save enough money even if I worked for decades on the first floor of Kunxu." [[552 张羽 neutral]]
"But if I can join a Great Sect, I'll be able to save up this amount in just a few years." [[553 张羽 neutral]]
The doll: "So?" [[554 邪神 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "What I mean is... as long as I study hard, cultivate diligently, keep getting stronger, get into a top university, and join a Great Sect after graduation, I can use my sect allowance to fulfill your wish." [[555 张羽 neutral]]
The doll was silent for a moment, then suddenly said, "You're saying you're going to study hard, then get a job to earn a salary, and fulfill my wish that way?" [[556 邪神 angry]]
"Are you kidding me?" [[557 邪神 angry]]
An endless wave of malice rushed forward. The doll's eyes were like two giant black holes, about to suck in all the surrounding light. [[558 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu clenched his fists, trying his best to control his trembling legs, and stared at the doll, saying word by word, "Your first wish is for me to grant you a thousand wishes. Your second wish is to collect the antiques in the shopping cart." [[559 张羽 neutral]]
"If I die of poverty while collecting antiques for you, how can I fulfill the thousand wishes?" [[560 张羽 neutral]]
"If I know this but still try to fulfill the second wish in a way that will kill me, isn't that deliberately failing to complete the first wish?" [[561 张羽 neutral]]
"Deliberately making myself unable to complete the first wish would violate the ritual's requirements. I'd probably die from the ritual's backlash before even completing the second wish, right?" [[562 张羽 neutral]]
"So, studying hard, getting into university, and working seriously to make money is the only feasible plan I can think of right now to fulfill both the first and second wishes." [[563 张羽 neutral]]
As Zhang Yu finished speaking, a dead silence filled the room. [[564 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, the doll's voice was heard. [[565 旁白 neutral]]
"Let me see your account balance." [[566 邪神 neutral]]
After seeing Zhang Yu's account balance and the text messages about overdue loans, the doll was silent for a long time. [[567 旁白 neutral]]
"This kid..." The doll's thoughts raced. "Normally, this situation wouldn't happen. The ritual is supposed to target rich people, for whom buying a pile of antiques is just a matter of lifting a finger." [[568 邪神 angry]]
"But this kid... this kid is too poor. So poor he can't even fulfill the first wish, so poor that he's created a loophole." [[569 邪神 angry]]
"Damn it, didn't I say to find someone rich! Why did you bring me this one!" [[570 邪神 angry]]
After a long silence, the doll looked at Zhang Yu and said, "What you said... does make some sense." [[571 邪神 neutral]]
"Fine, go study hard. I'll come find you when you've earned enough money." [[572 邪神 neutral]]
With that, the doll sneered again, "But you must remember, all of this is to fulfill my wishes." [[573 邪神 angry]]
"From now on, if you slack off in the process of fulfilling my wishes, you will die from the ritual's backlash." [[574 邪神 angry]]
Watching the doll gradually disappear, Zhang Yu let out a sharp breath and collapsed onto the bed, his body going limp. [[575 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, he remembered something and shouted, "Wait, this ritual... what did I get from this ritual?!" [[576 张羽 angry]]
Although he suspected his transmigration might be related to the ritual, he didn't dare to reveal this secret directly, choosing an indirect approach instead. [[577 旁白 neutral]]
Unless absolutely necessary, he decided to keep the secret of Earth buried deep in his heart, never to be revealed. [[578 旁白 neutral]]
The doll disappeared completely, leaving only a voice in Zhang Yu's ear: "Your potential has been stimulated. But everyone's potential is different. What it is... you'll have to feel it for yourself." [[579 邪神 neutral]]
Outside the room, the doll walked and thought, "This kid's aptitude is terrible. Stimulating his potential will probably just boost his mana or physical strength a little. I doubt he can even get into a university, let alone join a Great Sect. How can he fulfill my wishes?" [[580 邪神 neutral]]
"But his improvisation was quite interesting... Let's see how far you can struggle." [[581 邪神 neutral]]
Inside the room, Zhang Yu watched as the black symbol on his palm slowly began to change. [[582 旁白 neutral]]
