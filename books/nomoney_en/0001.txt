Chapter 1: The Interview [[1 旁白 neutral]]
"Are you there yet?" [[2 母亲 anxious]]
"Don't be nervous. Your grades are so good, you'll definitely pass." [[3 母亲 happy]]
"Don't worry about the surgery fee. Mom found a new part-time job and will definitely save up enough for you. Just focus on your interview." [[4 母亲 anxious]]
Looking at the messages from his mother on the screen, Zhang Yu quietly put his phone away, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and waited silently. [[5 旁白 neutral]]
After a long while, a number was called from the front. [[6 旁白 neutral]]
"Candidate number 989, Zhang Yu." [[7 面试官 neutral]]
Zhang Yu stood up and walked into the interview room. [[8 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at the three interviewers and gave a polite smile he had practiced for a long time. "Hello, I am Zhang Yu from Dongyang Junior High." [[9 张羽 neutral]]
The interviewer in the middle looked at him and asked flatly, "Why do you want to apply to our school?" [[10 面试官 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Your school has a long history, a deep cultural background, and rich educational resources. It has produced many outstanding talents for society..." [[11 张羽 neutral]]
The interviewer frowned and interrupted him, "Don't give me those empty formalities." [[12 面试官 angry]]
Zhang Yu answered honestly, "I want to get into a top university, and Songyang High School has the highest university acceptance rate of all the schools I can apply to." [[13 张羽 neutral]]
The interviewer smiled slightly, looked at the documents in his hand, and said, "Hmm, perfect scores in all subjects, first in the entire school? No wonder you were recommended." [[14 面试官 neutral]]
"Your grades are fine, but if you want to get into Songyang High School, your school exam scores are far from enough." [[15 面试官 neutral]]
He thought for a moment and asked casually, "How long do you sleep every day?" [[16 面试官 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Five hours." [[17 张羽 neutral]]
The interviewer said with surprise, "Five hours?" [[18 面试官 neutral]]
"Students at our school, starting from elementary school, sleep for no more than two hours a day on average. And the top graduates from past years almost never sleep at all." [[19 面试官 sarcastic]]
"You actually sleep for five hours a day? That means you study three hours less than others every day. Over nine years, that's a difference of almost ten thousand hours..." [[20 面试官 angry]]
Zhang Yu was stunned. He never thought that even though he considered himself very hardworking, there was still such a huge gap between him and others. [[21 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu quickly said, "I will work hard to catch up with them." [[22 张羽 anxious]]
The interviewer on the left asked, "How much of the high school curriculum have you studied?" [[23 面试官 neutral]]
Zhang Yu calmed down a little and said confidently, "I've already self-studied the entire first year of high school curriculum." [[24 张羽 neutral]]
The person frowned slightly. "Only the first year? Don't you know that we assume all students have already finished the entire high school curriculum before they even start classes here?" [[25 面试官 sarcastic]]
Zhang Yu was shocked to hear this. This was more information he didn't know, and what he thought was an advantage had turned into a disadvantage in an instant. [[26 旁白 neutral]]
Just as he was at a loss, the middle interviewer asked the next question. [[27 旁白 neutral]]
"To improve learning efficiency and prevent early romance, our school requires all students to undergo a sterilization surgery to remove the relevant organs before enrollment, so they can focus on cultivation." [[28 面试官 neutral]]
"Did you know about this?" [[29 面试官 neutral]]
Finally hearing something he knew, he quickly replied, "My family is already preparing for it. I will definitely complete the sterilization surgery before school starts to keep my hormone levels at the most suitable level for studying." [[30 张羽 anxious]]
The interviewer nodded without comment. "Alright, that's all for today's interview. You can go out now." [[31 面试官 neutral]]
Zhang Yu walked out of the classroom, feeling uneasy. He felt that his interview had been shorter than the other students'. [[32 旁白 neutral]]
After he left, the middle interviewer shook his head. "He hasn't even been sterilized in junior high. This child's determination for the Dao is not strong enough." [[33 面试官 sad]]
The female interviewer on the side smiled. "It looks like he came here knowing nothing. He doesn't have any of the required test reports or extracurricular exam results. I can only say the quality of recommended students from these ordinary junior highs is getting worse every year. If it weren't for the support policy, he wouldn't even be qualified to see us." [[34 女面试官 sarcastic]]
The middle interviewer nodded. "Sigh, I thought the poor would be more hardworking. Perhaps I expected too much of them." [[35 面试官 sad]]
"Let's put him on the waiting list for now." [[36 面试官 neutral]]
With that, he tossed Zhang Yu's resume into the wastebasket next to him, where it was squeezed in with hundreds of other resumes on the waiting list. [[37 旁白 neutral]]
Although Zhang Yu felt his interview hadn't gone well, he didn't have extra time to think about it. He had already started preparing for one interview after another, visiting many different high schools. [[38 旁白 neutral]]
"Student Zhang Yu, we understand that your family's financial situation may not be enough to afford the tuition here. However, we offer a preferential loan service for students from poor families. You just need to be willing to mortgage some of your unimportant organs..." [[39 面试官 neutral]]
"Don't worry, you've come to the right place. We know you are male, and although our school is an all-girls school, we never discriminate against males. As long as you complete gender reassignment surgery, not only can you enroll, but you will also be considered a promising student with a strong Dao Heart and have the opportunity to enter the key class to study the art of Yuan Yin Qi Refining..." [[40 面试官 neutral]]
"It's a pity, you're just a little short of our admission standard. However, to help poor students this year, we have introduced a special talent policy. If you are willing to give up your physical body, you can study in the principal's Myriad Soul Banner as a soul cultivation talent..." [[41 面试官 neutral]]
"Student, you've come to the right place. This is the most suitable high school for a common genius like you." [[42 面试官 happy]]
"Let me introduce the benefits here. We add intelligence-promoting agents to the drinking water to ensure that students maintain a level-five state of concentration at all times." [[43 面试官 happy]]
"Every day, the head teacher will give you more than 900 grams of supplements specially for bull demons, ensuring your cultivation effect is more than ten times the original." [[44 面试官 happy]]
"Even the air circulation system is filled with nerve-stimulating fillers, so you no longer need to sleep, and all of this is free." [[45 面试官 happy]]
"Of course, to withstand these performance-enhancing supplements, you must undergo modifications at our designated hospital." [[46 面试官 neutral]]
"Don't worry, you just need to implant some small magical artifacts to enhance your metabolic capacity. Here is the specific price list..." [[47 面试官 happy]]
One interview after another, one question after another. [[48 旁白 neutral]]
Either the requirements were impossibly high, leaving him with no hope. [[49 旁白 neutral]]
Or the contracts were full of traps, making him feel like he would be swallowed whole. [[50 旁白 neutral]]
All of this made Zhang Yu feel like he was suffocating under the pressure. [[51 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, he suddenly realized that despite being first in his school in a suburban junior high, he was worlds apart from the students in the city center. [[52 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, he only knew the tip of the iceberg about how large the gap between them really was. [[53 旁白 neutral]]
All his years of hard study seemed like a joke. [[54 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, he was no different from his classmates who didn't study; he couldn't get into high school either. [[55 旁白 sad]]
Back at home, Zhang Yu sat silently like a stone statue. [[56 旁白 neutral]]
The phone on the table vibrated again and again. [[57 旁白 neutral]]
Mother: How was the interview this time? [[58 母亲 anxious]]
Mother: I have to work overtime today. Remember to heat up the food in the fridge for yourself. [[59 母亲 neutral]]
A moment later, the phone vibrated again. [[60 旁白 neutral]]
Mother: Son, don't worry. Whether you choose sterilization or a sex change, Mom will definitely get the money for the surgery for you. [[61 母亲 anxious]]
But Zhang Yu didn't look at the vibrating phone. He just stared blankly at the ceiling, trying to think about the future, but his mind felt empty, unable to squeeze out a single thought. [[62 旁白 desperate]]
Just then, the phone began to vibrate violently again. [[63 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu didn't want to answer it at first, but after the phone vibrated for over a minute, he couldn't help but pick it up, only to find that the other party had already hung up. [[64 旁白 neutral]]
Then he received a message from them: Your five thousand reserve fund is ready and can be in your account in just ten seconds... [[65 旁白 neutral]]
"A loan advertisement?" [[66 张羽 sarcastic]]
"Hmph." [[67 张羽 angry]]
Zhang Yu thought that his interview information had probably been sold by one of the schools. [[68 旁白 neutral]]
But after putting the phone down for a moment, he picked it up again and reopened the message. [[69 旁白 neutral]]
... [[70 旁白 neutral]]
That night, when his mother came home from working overtime, she found that the once deathly pale Zhang Yu seemed to have recovered and was sitting at the desk reading a book. [[71 旁白 neutral]]
"Mom, don't worry. I won't be defeated so easily." [[72 张羽 happy]]
"If I can't do it this year, I'll try again next year. I will definitely cultivate." [[73 张羽 happy]]
"I'll go find a cram school tomorrow. I'm going to make up for everything I'm lacking, one by one." [[74 张羽 happy]]
The next morning, Zhang Yu rushed out, and when he returned that night, his face was full of joy. [[75 旁白 neutral]]
"Mom, I found a cultivation cram school. The teachers there are all from top high schools. Studying with them, I'll definitely get into a good high school." [[76 张羽 happy]]
"Don't worry about the tuition. They think I've had good grades since I was little and know my family isn't wealthy, so they've temporarily waived my tuition. As long as I can get into Songyang High School next year, I won't have to pay it back. It will be like an advertisement for them." [[77 张羽 happy]]
"Don't worry, they are a big company. They won't trick me." [[78 张羽 happy]]
His mother watched as Zhang Yu left for the cram school before dawn every day and studied until two or three in the morning after returning home late at night. [[79 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing him constantly bring back textbooks for the second and third years of high school in subjects like language, math, and physics, and seeing his plan to finish all the general courses besides cultivation in one year, she felt gratified by her son's ambition. [[80 旁白 happy]]
But when she saw the boxes of medicine he brought back, a trace of doubt still arose in her heart. [[81 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu explained with a smile, "Mom, since I was little, I've studied ten thousand hours less than those top students. If I don't work harder, I'll only fall further and further behind them." [[82 张羽 happy]]
"These nerve-stimulating fillers allow me to sleep only half an hour a day and improve my learning efficiency, so at least I won't fall further behind the students in the city." [[83 张羽 happy]]
"Don't worry, these medicines don't cost anything." [[84 张羽 happy]]
"The principal of our cram school really values me. He gave me all this medicine." [[85 张羽 happy]]
Hearing that the principal had given them to him, his mother was even happier that her son was being appreciated. [[86 旁白 happy]]
Soon, Zhang Yu brought back more things. [[87 旁白 neutral]]
In addition to various high school textbooks and nerve-stimulating fillers, there were also capsules to regulate hormone levels, supplements for demon beasts, and bottles of unlabeled medicinal powder. [[88 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu had many explanations, sometimes saying they were cheap goods bought from a part-time job, sometimes that a classmate gave them to him, and sometimes that they were rewards from the cram school... [[89 旁白 neutral]]
His mother was happy about her son's diligence, and even more pleased with his good relationships and excellent performance at the cram school. [[90 旁白 happy]]
She transferred 1000 yuan to Zhang Yu, telling him to remember to thank his classmates and teachers. [[91 旁白 neutral]]
But gradually, she noticed that Zhang Yu's mood began to change. Sometimes he would be happy before leaving in the morning, but when he came back at night, he would go straight to bed without saying a word. [[92 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes he would be eating happily, but after answering a phone call, his brow would furrow, and he couldn't eat another bite. [[93 旁白 neutral]]
She knew it must be the immense pressure of cultivation that was making Zhang Yu so tense. [[94 旁白 neutral]]
She could only buy more of his favorite foods and save more money for his tuition, hoping to relieve some of his pressure. [[95 旁白 sad]]
Gradually, she also noticed that Zhang Yu was particularly protective of his phone. Not only did he almost never part with it, but he also didn't allow anyone to touch it. Whenever he got a call, he would go into the bathroom and close the door to answer it. [[96 旁白 neutral]]
One time, she saw that his phone was out of battery and took it to charge it, but Zhang Yu got angry and scolded her for it. [[97 旁白 neutral]]
Understanding his pressure, she never dared to touch Zhang Yu's phone again, for fear of affecting her son's cultivation. [[98 旁白 sad]]
Suddenly one day, Zhang Yu asked her for money for cram school fees, saying that the school had invited a senior who had been accepted into a top university to give a lecture, and this was the money for the senior. [[99 旁白 neutral]]
Then there was a recommendation fee for the high school admissions officer. [[100 旁白 neutral]]
A fee for a spiritual root test at the hospital. [[101 旁白 neutral]]
And he needed to buy a civilian-grade children's flying sword with his cram school classmates. [[102 旁白 neutral]]
From two or three thousand to seven or eight thousand... the last time, he asked her to transfer twenty thousand yuan directly, saying it was the fee for renting a heavenly spiritual root. [[103 旁白 neutral]]
But good news finally came: Zhang Yu had successfully been admitted to Songyang High School. [[104 旁白 neutral]]
His mother was overjoyed. She was proud of her son's hard work and talent and readily agreed to all of Zhang Yu's subsequent requests for tuition, miscellaneous fees, and medicine costs. [[105 旁白 happy]]
But after school started, Zhang Yu began asking for more and more money, and the family's income could no longer cover the expenses. [[106 旁白 anxious]]
Finally, one afternoon, listening to the voice on the other end of the phone, her heart trembled. [[107 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello? Is this Zhang Yu's mother?" [[108 催债人 neutral]]
"Do you know that your son's loan is already 30 days overdue..." [[109 催债人 angry]]
That night, Zhang Yu confessed everything to his mother. [[110 旁白 neutral]]
For the past year, the various expenses for his studies were not free, appreciated, or gifted as he had claimed... all the money came from loans he had taken out from major platforms. [[111 旁白 neutral]]
"Mom, I'm sorry." [[112 张羽 sad]]
"But I really want to cultivate." [[113 张羽 desperate]]
"Even if I have to be in debt for the rest of my life, I want to cultivate..." [[114 张羽 desperate]]
After hearing all this, his mother silently sold all the valuable things in the house and then borrowed more money to pay off Zhang Yu's debts. [[115 旁白 sad]]
She thought that her son would be able to focus on cultivation after this. [[116 旁白 neutral]]
But she soon discovered her son had new overdue loans. [[117 旁白 anxious]]
Repay the loan... take out a loan... repay the loan... take out a loan... [[118 旁白 desperate]]
His mother finally couldn't help but persuade Zhang Yu to spend less money. [[119 旁白 sad]]
"Mom, I can't stop this medicine. If I stop, my Dao Heart will regress, and all my previous efforts will be wasted..." [[120 张羽 desperate]]
"I have to rent the heavenly spiritual root. Without it, my mana can't keep up..." [[121 张羽 desperate]]
"This cram school VIP card needs to be topped up, otherwise I won't be able to understand the techniques the school teacher talks about in class..." [[122 张羽 desperate]]
Advanced cultivation technology allowed mortals without spiritual roots to walk the path of an immortal, but the price was to regularly undergo the most expensive learning and maintenance to continue on that path. [[123 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, three months of school had passed. Seeing the growing debt, to the point where they could no longer afford rent, water, and electricity... it all felt like a never-ending nightmare, and his mother could no longer bear it. [[124 旁白 desperate]]
So, when Zhang Yu came home from school another day, he never saw his mother again. [[125 旁白 sad]]
He sat stunned for a long time after reading his mother's note, and finally walked silently up to the rooftop. [[126 旁白 sad]]
... [[127 旁白 neutral]]
On the rooftop of the rental apartment. [[128 旁白 neutral]]
A sharp pain shot through the man's mind, gradually waking his chaotic consciousness from the darkness. [[129 旁白 neutral]]
He opened his eyes and looked forward, seeing a street not far away, bustling with people and overflowing with sewage. [[130 旁白 neutral]]
On both sides of the street, various advertising signs flickered with neon lights. Looking up, he saw dark buildings crowded together, as if trying to cover the entire sky. [[131 旁白 neutral]]
And the building under his feet was a dilapidated apartment. A video of a financial advertisement was being projected onto its mottled red brick wall, in which high-flying immortals were jointly recommending a cultivation loan with thirty days interest-free for new users. [[132 旁白 neutral]]
"Wasn't I just playing Black Myth: Wukong?" [[133 张羽 neutral]]
"Where is this?" [[134 张羽 neutral]]
Just as he was wondering what was going on, he turned his head and found that the rooftop was filled with candles. [[135 旁白 neutral]]
Rows of candles flickering with a scarlet glow surrounded him and a worn-out doll. [[136 旁白 neutral]]
It was a cloth doll with yellowed, faded fabric and crooked stitches, looking as if it could fall apart at any moment. [[137 旁白 neutral]]
The strange scene seemed to stimulate his brain, causing fragmented memories to tumble and leap through his mind. [[138 旁白 neutral]]
"This isn't China anymore... I've been sent to another world?" [[139 张羽 anxious]]
He found it hard to accept that he had traveled to another world. [[140 旁白 neutral]]
But the real memories of cultivation technology in his head kept冲击ing his consciousness, merging him with the original body while constantly reminding him that he was now in another world. [[141 旁白 neutral]]
This was Kunxu, a super-structure built like a pyramid on the earth, with thirty-six floors above ground and eighteen floors below. [[142 旁白 neutral]]
Starting from the largest, continent-sized first floor, each floor was a new world. [[143 旁白 neutral]]
As for what the world outside of Kunxu was like, Zhang Yu had no answer in his head. [[144 旁白 neutral]]
He only knew that within Kunxu, it was a world where the major cultivation sects were supreme. [[145 旁白 neutral]]
The major sects were high and mighty, and they had a near-monopoly on all industries such as food, energy, transportation, education, research, medicine, finance, and the internet. In front of the sect's law enforcement teams, the government and army were more like security guards. [[146 旁白 neutral]]
But ordinary people could not enjoy most of the benefits brought by cultivation technology and were instead busy making a living every day. [[147 旁白 neutral]]
And he was a high school student named Zhang Yu, living on the first floor of Kunxu, who had recently been obsessed with some strange ritual... [[148 旁白 neutral]]
"I have now become the Zhang Yu of another world." [[149 张羽 neutral]]
Just then, a sharp pain came from his palm, waking Zhang Yu from the shock of his memories. [[150 旁白 neutral]]
He looked down and saw a transparent symbol appear in his palm, which was slowly turning black at an extremely slow speed. [[151 旁白 neutral]]
"What is this thing?" [[152 张羽 neutral]]
As the night wind blew, the surrounding scarlet candlelight flickered. [[153 旁白 neutral]]
And the worn-out doll on the ground stared at him with empty eyes made of black buttons. [[154 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to remember what had happened, but the more he thought, the dizzier and more pained his head became. [[155 旁白 neutral]]
The atmosphere in the air became more and more gloomy and strange. Zhang Yu clutched his still-dizzy head, feeling the world spin around him. [[156 旁白 anxious]]
When he came to his senses, he found that he had dazedly left the rooftop and walked step by step back to his front door. [[157 旁白 neutral]]
He glanced at the rent collection notice, stepped through the door, and all that greeted his eyes was a bed and a table. [[158 旁白 neutral]]
"Is this my home?" [[159 张羽 sad]]
Feeling his sticky skin soaked with sweat and the incredibly stuffy environment, Zhang Yu wanted to find the air conditioner remote, but then he remembered that there was no air conditioner in this house at all. [[160 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to take a shower, but found that the water had been shut off. [[161 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu sat down on the bed, feeling helpless. [[162 旁白 sad]]
"What a dump." [[163 张羽 angry]]
"So what if there are real immortals? This life is worse than in a world without them." [[164 张羽 desperate]]
Zhang Yu's gaze swept across the wall and found that the wall behind the desk was covered with award certificates from his childhood. [[165 旁白 neutral]]
First grade, second grade, third grade... all the way to the third year of junior high, the original Zhang Yu was almost always number one in his grade. [[166 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at these awards, various memories of receiving them flooded his mind: "The original Zhang Yu was a diligent and hardworking student who had excellent grades since he was a child." [[167 张羽 neutral]]
"The Songyang High School I'm currently attending is also a key high school in the city." [[168 张羽 neutral]]
"I'm a top student." [[169 张羽 happy]]
Recalling the knowledge in his mind, Zhang Yu's eyes gradually brightened: "If I get into a top university, I can reach Foundation Establishment. If I join a major sect, I can form a golden core. I can also climb higher in Kunxu, leave this slum, and enjoy more of the benefits of cultivation technology. Living a few hundred more years won't be a problem then." [[170 张羽 happy]]
Thinking of this, Zhang Yu suddenly felt that coming to this world seemed to be a good thing after all. [[171 旁白 happy]]
Just as he was thinking this, his phone suddenly rang. [[172 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello?" [[173 张羽 neutral]]
"Hello, Mr. Zhang Yu, your loan on our platform is already 3 days overdue..." [[174 催债人 angry]]
After hanging up, Zhang Yu scrolled through his text messages and found a dense collection of payment reminder messages, all overdue notices from the original body's loans on various platforms. [[175 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, related memories flooded his mind. [[176 旁白 neutral]]
"This guy started borrowing money for cram school before he even got into high school. After getting into Songyang High School, in order to keep up with everyone's grades, he had a bright idea and started borrowing more to pay off old loans to improve his grades, borrowing money from everywhere to take medicine and attend cram schools, forcibly stimulating his potential. In the end, not only did he borrow more and more money, but his potential was also gradually exhausted." [[177 旁白 neutral]]
"This guy is a fake cultivation genius, propped up by loans." [[178 张羽 angry]]
"Even his mom couldn't stand him and finally left him." [[179 旁白 sad]]
Calculating the total overdue loans, cold sweat immediately broke out on Zhang Yu's forehead. [[180 旁白 anxious]]
It was because he discovered that with the interest rolling over, Zhang Yu already owed various platforms a total of more than seven hundred thousand yuan. [[181 旁白 desperate]]
And looking at his account, he only had a little over fifty yuan left. [[182 旁白 desperate]]
"I actually owe seven hundred thousand... Damn it!" [[183 张羽 desperate]]
Zhang Yu slammed his fist on the bed and said angrily, "In this world... even for a top student graduating from high school, this is a huge debt." [[184 张羽 angry]]
"No wonder this guy was obsessed with some weird ritual... He's a hopeless loan addict." [[185 张羽 angry]]
"He had his fun, and now I'm the one who has to pay his debts?" [[186 张羽 angry]]
At the same time, the lights in the room suddenly went out. [[187 旁白 neutral]]
After flipping the switch several times and observing the situation of his neighbors, Zhang Yu confirmed one thing... his power had been cut off. [[188 旁白 neutral]]
"This stupid place..." [[189 张羽 angry]]
"It would be great if I could just go back when I wake up tomorrow morning..." [[190 张羽 desperate]]
With all sorts of chaotic thoughts swirling in his mind, Zhang Yu eventually fell into a drowsy sleep on the bed. [[191 旁白 neutral]]
And on his palm, the once-transparent symbol was now one-tenth filled with black. [[192 旁白 neutral]]
