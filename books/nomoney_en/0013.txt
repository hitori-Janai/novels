Chapter 13: The Mana Tournament [[1374 旁白 neutral]]
On this day in mana class, the students of the demonstration class were sitting cross-legged in the quiet room, practicing a breathing technique. [[1375 旁白 neutral]]
A camera at the front monitored their every move, recording any slight irregularity—whether a student opened their eyes, scratched an itch, fidgeted, or wriggled in their seat. [[1376 旁白 neutral]]
All of this data was compiled and recorded as a "distraction rate." [[1377 旁白 neutral]]
Each week, the class with the highest distraction rate was publicly criticized by the entire school. [[1378 旁白 neutral]]
The students of the demonstration class weren't concerned; no matter the assessment, their class was always guaranteed to be first. [[1379 旁白 neutral]]
However, the student with the lowest weekly distraction rate would not only be publicly praised but also rewarded with 500 yuan and a one-hour free rental of a Heavenly Spiritual Root. [[1380 旁白 neutral]]
This reward made every student in the demonstration class sit up and pay attention. [[1381 旁白 neutral]]
When Zhang Yu first learned of this "distraction rate," he thought that if it had existed in his previous life, students would have cursed the school for being completely insane. [[1382 旁白 neutral]]
But this world was different. The students in the demonstration class stared at the daily distraction rate like bulls in heat, and the whole classroom was filled with a fierce, competitive atmosphere. [[1383 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, a bell rang, and the students, who had been silently cultivating, stopped and looked at the large screen at the front, awaiting the distraction rate data for the class. [[1384 旁白 neutral]]
1st Place: Zhang Yu, Distraction Rate 0% [[1385 旁白 neutral]]
2nd Place: Bai Zhenzhen, Distraction Rate 0.03% [[1386 旁白 neutral]]
3rd Place: Qian Shen, Distraction Rate 0.12% [[1387 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1388 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the rankings, although the students remained silent, a ripple of surprise could be seen in the subtle changes in their eyes and expressions. [[1389 旁白 neutral]]
The mana class instructor, a woman with her hair in a bun and wearing black-framed glasses, was named Yan. [[1390 旁白 neutral]]
Teacher Yan looked at the results on the screen and said, "I won't call out the names of the few students whose distraction rate exceeded 0.3% today." [[1391 严老师 angry]]
"It's been three months since school started. How many times have I told you to focus your mind and unify your qi?" [[1392 严老师 angry]]
"With such a high distraction rate, how can your breathing efficiency possibly compare to others?" [[1393 严老师 angry]]
"Everyone cultivates 24 hours a day. You don't get more time than anyone else. If your breathing efficiency is low, you fall behind a little each day. After three years of high school, the gap in your mana could be 10, 20, or even 30 points." [[1394 严老师 angry]]
"And how many times have I said it? Students who can't lower their distraction rate can come to my office to buy Calming Agent. I sat in my office for three hours yesterday afternoon, and not a single person came to ask... Do you all think you have no problems at all?!" [[1395 严老师 angry]]
After her criticism, Teacher Yan smiled slightly and looked at the top names on the screen. "Of course, there are also students who performed very well." [[1396 严老师 happy]]
"I want to give special praise to the three students with the lowest distraction rates, especially Zhang Yu. His rate has been 0% for four consecutive days. Compared to before, this is a massive improvement." [[1397 严老师 happy]]
"His mana has also increased by 0.5 points in the last three days, which shows he must have put in a lot of hard work outside of class. He either rented a Spiritual Root or a high-level cultivation room, right, Zhang Yu?" [[1398 严老师 happy]]
All the students immediately turned to look at him. [[1399 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu's eyes were still tightly closed, as if he were half-asleep, still silently circulating the Zhou-Tian Qi-Gathering Method. [[1400 旁白 neutral]]
Teacher Yan said with admiration, "Look, this is the attitude of a true top student. He doesn't even stop after class, seizing every minute and every second to cultivate and become stronger." [[1401 严老师 happy]]
Zhou Tianyi looked at Zhang Yu, who was still focused on his breathing, and found he understood his classmate less and less. "He's clearly such a hard worker, so why does he slack off and not use stimulants in P.E. class?" [[1402 周天翊 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen watched Zhang Yu, his eyes still shut, and thought, "These past few days, aside from eating and using the bathroom, Yu'zi has been breathing almost non-stop, even while walking. Is he pushing himself this hard because of the 700,000 yuan debt collection calls?" [[1403 白真真 neutral]]
At the front of the class, Teacher Yan continued, "Of course, you get what you pay for. There's no free lunch on the path of cultivation. You won't get far without spending money. There are some Heavenly Spiritual Roots available for rent at the school recently. Any interested students can come see me." [[1404 严老师 neutral]]
But before Teacher Yan left, she said something that caught Zhang Yu's attention. [[1405 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, right, the city's Mana Tournament starts next month. Basically, all high schools in the city will participate in the first-year division. The first-place prize is 100,000 yuan..." [[1406 严老师 neutral]]
"Because registration is next Friday, the school plans to select the top ten students in terms of mana level from the first-year grade to participate..." [[1407 严老师 neutral]]
... [[1408 旁白 neutral]]
That evening, in the cafeteria. [[1409 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi had to leave early for his tutoring class, leaving only Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen at the table. [[1410 旁白 neutral]]
After being stared at by Bai Zhenzhen for an uncomfortably long time, Zhang Yu spoke up. "Ah Zhen, I know I'm handsome, and in a school full of bookworms like Songyang High, I stand out like a crane among chickens. But you don't have to stare so intently." [[1411 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen asked, "You're saying you want to participate in the Mana Tournament?" [[1412 白真真 neutral]]
"What a pity, Ah Zhen." Zhang Yu shook his head. "If you, the top-ranked genius of our grade, weren't my friend, you would probably provoke me now, only to be repeatedly shocked by my amazing performance in the tournament, your world shaken to its core." [[1413 张羽 happy]]
Bai Zhenzhen shook her head. "Yu'zi, you want to compete in the city-wide Mana Tournament." [[1414 白真真 neutral]]
"That's where all the high schools in Songyang City send their best, most powerful, and wealthiest students to compete. It's a gathering of countless super-rich people." [[1415 白真真 neutral]]
With a look of deep sympathy, Bai Zhenzhen said, "What do you think will happen to an ordinary person like you?" [[1416 白真真 sad]]
Her eyes seemed to have already seen the tragic future. "You'll be repeatedly humiliated by countless powerful opponents, become a stepping stone for the rich, the laughingstock of Songyang High, and drag the school's reputation into the dust!" [[1417 白真真 sad]]
"It's too tragic! I can already see you being ruthlessly crushed under the feet of geniuses from other high schools, your Dao Heart shattered, lying there like a dead dog." [[1418 白真真 sad]]
Zhang Yu rolled his eyes. "Don't be so dramatic. The Mana Tournament isn't a fighting ring. There's no shame in losing." [[1419 张羽 neutral]]
"Besides, the first prize is one hundred thousand yuan." [[1420 张羽 happy]]
"Even the top ten get ten thousand yuan." [[1421 张羽 happy]]
Seeing Zhang Yu's greedy expression, Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself that the debt collectors must have really pushed him over the edge, making him delusional enough to want to enter the tournament. [[1422 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was indeed in financial trouble. Although he had just earned 13,000 from Xianyun Company a few days ago, he had immediately used 10,000 to pay off a loan and another 1,500 for rent, leaving him with just over 2,000 yuan. [[1423 旁白 neutral]]
"If you want to compete, first figure out how to get your mana level into the top ten of our grade. You're ranked 16th right now, right? How much money will you have to borrow to break into the top ten?" [[1424 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu quickly calculated in his head. [[1425 旁白 neutral]]
His current mana was 8.3, ranking him 16th in the grade. [[1426 旁白 neutral]]
The student currently ranked tenth had a mana of 9.5. [[1427 旁白 neutral]]
To surpass that person, Zhang Yu would need to raise his mana to 9.5 before next Friday... [[1428 旁白 neutral]]
"No, I have to consider that everyone else will be improving too." [[1429 旁白 neutral]]
"To be safe, I should probably aim to get my mana to 10.0 before next Friday." [[1430 旁白 neutral]]
"There are eight days until next Friday. Can I really raise my mana from 8.3 to 10.0, a full 1.7 points, in that time?" [[1431 旁白 neutral]]
"That's an increase of more than 0.2 per day... Is that even possible?" [[1432 旁白 neutral]]
Absolutely! Easily! [[1433 旁白 neutral]]
In the eyes of other teachers and students, his recent rapid progress must have been the result of spending a fortune to rent high-quality Spiritual Roots and cultivation spots. [[1434 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu knew it all came from his amazing potential and extreme self-discipline. [[1435 旁白 neutral]]
A level 4 Zhou-Tian Qi-Gathering Method had allowed him to increase his mana by 0.5 in just three days. He believed that as the method continued to level up, his mana would increase even faster. [[1436 旁白 neutral]]
"After all, the highest skill level in the Qi Refining stage is level 10." [[1437 旁白 neutral]]
"A level 4 breathing technique is something most first-year high school students couldn't possibly achieve in their first semester." [[1438 旁白 neutral]]
"As I continue to cultivate, I'll probably be able to raise the Zhou-Tian Qi-Gathering Method to level 8, 9, or even 10 in a short time. That's a level many might not reach even after three years of high school." [[1439 旁白 neutral]]
As he was steeling his resolve with this thought, he suddenly saw Bai Zhenzhen's chopsticks reach for his bowl. [[1440 旁白 neutral]]
"How dare you!" Zhang Yu shouted, raising his own chopsticks to block her. [[1441 张羽 angry]]
With a series of clashing sounds, his chopsticks were easily deflected by Bai Zhenzhen. [[1442 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling a familiarity in her movements, Zhang Yu was surprised. "High School Basic Sword Arts? You've already learned it? And you've adapted it for use with chopsticks?" [[1443 张羽 neutral]]
Quickly snatching a few pieces of meat from Zhang Yu's bowl, Bai Zhenzhen chuckled. "Is it that hard, Yu'zi? Isn't it easy if you just have hands?" [[1444 白真真 happy]]
Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Damn, she's showing off again." [[1445 张羽 angry]]
Mixing the stolen meat with her rice, Bai Zhenzhen took a few quick bites and said with surprise, "I didn't expect the pork ribs in the 5-yuan set meal to be so good. I'll buy a portion next time." [[1446 白真真 happy]]
Patting her slightly full stomach, Bai Zhenzhen let out a burp and said, "Sigh, if I eat any more, it'll affect my tutoring session." [[1447 白真真 neutral]]
With that, she pushed her meal tray toward Zhang Yu. "Extra food for you, Yu'zi." [[1448 白真真 happy]]
Looking at the neat, untouched half-portion of 'leftovers' Bai Zhenzhen had left, Zhang Yu understood she had intentionally saved it for him. [[1449 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed that since learning about his financial difficulties, Bai Zhenzhen had often been feeding him during dinner. [[1450 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu pulled the tray over and said while eating, "Ah Zhen, you don't have to worry about my pride or face. With our relationship, it's fine even if you just give me money directly." [[1451 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen rolled her eyes. "I'm heading to my tutoring session. Take your time eating." [[1452 白真真 neutral]]
... [[1453 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the cafeteria. [[1454 旁白 neutral]]
A tall figure stood in a nearby corridor, eyes fixed on the cafeteria entrance. [[1455 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, when he saw Zhang Yu walk out of the cafeteria, the tall figure's spirits lifted, and he immediately followed him. [[1456 旁白 neutral]]
He followed Zhang Yu out of the school gate and saw him enter a stationery store across the street. A thought struck Zhao Tianyi: "Could this be where Zhang Yu gets his supplies?" [[1457 旁白 neutral]]
