Chapter 25: The Qi Sea [[2508]]
"That Yuanyang Spiritual Root is also very popular among the Heavenly Spiritual Roots. After all, most of the guys at our school are virgins. The Yuanyang Spiritual Root can refine the pure yang essence in a virgin's body into mana; it's very powerful." [[2509 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing said proudly, "Especially this one at our school. It's been passed down for almost twenty years. Generations of seniors have used it, and it's absorbed the pure yang essence of thousands of students, which makes it even more mystical." [[2510 赵天行 happy]]
Zhang Yu frowned as he listened. He felt that this Yuanyang Spiritual Root sounded a bit... dirty. And also... [[2511 旁白 neutral]]
"Isn't everyone sterilized? How can they still use this 'virgin' spiritual root?" [[2512 张羽 neutral]]
"It's the Yuanyang Spiritual Root," Zhao Tianxing explained. "The sterilization surgery only temporarily removes certain organs. The pure yang essence in our bodies is still continuously produced by the kidneys, it just no longer affects our emotions or mind." [[2513 赵天行 neutral]]
"Otherwise, how could people have restorative surgery after they grow up and get a 'new root'?" [[2514 赵天行 neutral]]
As they walked, Zhang Yu asked, "Among the school's Heavenly Spiritual Roots, are there any that are particularly good for increasing mana?" [[2515 张羽 neutral]]
Hearing this, Zhao Tianxing's interest was piqued. He recalled Zhang Yu's recent actions and realized how focused he had been on increasing his mana lately. [[2516 旁白 neutral]]
"Could it be for the mana competition?" [[2517 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing thought for a moment and said, "There are many spiritual roots that help with mana. The most effective one at our school is probably the Qi Sea Spiritual Root. It's quite expensive, but since you're getting it as a free reward, the price doesn't matter..." [[2518 赵天行 neutral]]
The Qi Sea Spiritual Root, nicknamed the "Wall-Through King," had the great advantage of a huge range. It could pass through walls, buildings, and even the ground to gather spiritual energy from a wide area, increasing the efficiency of mana refining. [[2519 旁白 neutral]]
After listening to Zhao Tianxing's description, Zhang Yu had already decided to try this Heavenly Spiritual Root. [[2520 旁白 neutral]]
Arriving at the spiritual root rental office next to the meditation room, Zhang Yu didn't immediately state his choice. Instead, he picked up the brochure on the desk and started reading. [[2521 旁白 neutral]]
The administrator was a female teacher with a baby face. [[2522 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu, she seized the opportunity to ask, "Student, are you a member here? Are you familiar with any of the spiritual roots?" [[2523 管理员 neutral]]
Without looking up, Zhang Yu replied, "No, and no." [[2524 张羽 neutral]]
The administrator quickly made a sales pitch, "We have a promotion for new members: deposit ten thousand and get one thousand free. Would you like to try?" [[2525 管理员 happy]]
Zhang Yu said, "I'm here for the Heavenly Spiritual Root rental from the 0% distraction rate reward. I'm only taking the reward. I'm not interested in anything else, so you don't need to sell me anything." [[2526 张羽 neutral]]
Hearing this, the administrator gave a helpless smile and stepped back. "Alright, just let me know if you need anything else." [[2527 管理员 sad]]
Listening to him, she silently labeled Zhang Yu as "stingy" in her mind and lost all interest in making a sale. [[2528 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu didn't care what she thought. He just lowered his head, quickly scanned the brochure, and found that it said pretty much the same thing Zhao Tianxing had. [[2529 旁白 neutral]]
So he said to the administrator, "I'd like to rent the Qi Sea Spiritual Root." [[2530 张羽 neutral]]
She replied, "Scan your student card." [[2531 管理员 neutral]]
Zhang Yu took out his student card and handed it to her. [[2532 旁白 neutral]]
This Songyang High School student card was his proof of identity, the key credential that allowed him to legally cultivate and access various related services. [[2533 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, the administrator returned from the office with a jade box. [[2534 旁白 neutral]]
"The Qi Sea Spiritual Root is inside. Go to meditation room #2, open the box, and consume the spiritual root." [[2535 管理员 neutral]]
"Your rental time is one hour. It starts the moment you enter the room. If you're over by even one minute, it counts as a full hour, so watch the time..." [[2536 管理员 neutral]]
After explaining the details, the rental administrator urged Zhang Yu to go in. [[2537 旁白 neutral]]
Zhao Tianxing, who was standing nearby, said, "Well, I'll let you get to it, Zhang Yu. I have to go." [[2538 赵天行 neutral]]
Zhang Yu nodded at him. "Thanks." [[2539 张羽 neutral]]
Watching Zhang Yu turn and leave, Zhao Tianxing replayed the expression and tone in his mind, thinking, "I think our relationship got a little closer this time, right?" [[2540 赵天行 neutral]]
Meanwhile, inside meditation room #2. [[2541 旁白 neutral]]
It was a room about twenty square meters in size. A meditation cushion was placed in the center, and the walls were covered with soundproofing material, on which were drawn many twisted talismans of various sizes. [[2542 旁白 neutral]]
It was said these talismans could accelerate the gathering of spiritual energy and improve the efficiency of cultivation. [[2543 旁白 neutral]]
However, Zhang Yu only had one hour from the moment he stepped in. He had no time to worry about the room's decor. He went straight to the cushion and opened the jade box. [[2544 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the palm-sized box was a delicate, translucent crystal, glowing with a faint green light. [[2545 旁白 neutral]]
The crystal floated in the center of the box, surrounded by swirling specks of light like green smoke. [[2546 旁白 neutral]]
This was the spiritual root he had rented, the Heavenly Spiritual Root known as the Qi Sea Spiritual Root. [[2547 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu carefully picked up the Qi Sea Spiritual Root. As soon as he brought it to his lips, he felt a coolness in his throat, and the Heavenly Spiritual Root slid into his body like a gulp of ice water, sinking down into his lower Dantian. [[2548 旁白 neutral]]
Once the Qi Sea Spiritual Root entered his Dantian, it was as if it sprouted roots, extending crystal-like tendrils into the surrounding mana. [[2549 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu knew that, according to the manual and the administrator, the Heavenly Spiritual Root had now been successfully planted in his Dantian. [[2550 旁白 neutral]]
Now, all he had to do was cultivate as usual, and the Heavenly Spiritual Root would naturally do its work. [[2551 旁白 neutral]]
With this thought, Zhang Yu took a deep breath and began to circulate the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method. [[2552 旁白 neutral]]
Boom! [[2553 旁白 neutral]]
A loud noise seemed to explode in his mind. [[2554 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu felt the surrounding spiritual energy swarm towards him, pouring into the Heavenly Spiritual Root inside his body. [[2555 旁白 neutral]]
"Two times?" [[2556 张羽 neutral]]
"Three times?" [[2557 张羽 neutral]]
"So fast... and it's still increasing!" [[2558 张羽 happy]]
Feeling more and more spiritual energy pouring into his body, Zhang Yu quickly focused his mind and operated the level 6 Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method at full power. [[2559 旁白 neutral]]
As the mana circulation throughout his body accelerated, wisps of spiritual energy were refined into mana. [[2560 旁白 neutral]]
His Dantian, which had felt bloated from the rush of spiritual energy, returned to normal. [[2561 旁白 neutral]]
But as if sensing the speed of Zhang Yu's mana refining, the Qi Sea Spiritual Root in his Dantian pulsed and expanded, once again increasing the speed at which it gathered spiritual energy. [[2562 旁白 neutral]]
This time, it wasn't just the spiritual energy around Zhang Yu that rushed in; even the energy from outside the room was drawn to him. [[2563 旁白 neutral]]
The hallway... outside the window... the sky... even underground... [[2564 旁白 neutral]]
The Qi Sea Spiritual Root increased its gathering range in step with Zhang Yu's refining efficiency, finally stopping at a radius of 50 meters. [[2565 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling a massive amount of spiritual energy pouring into his body like a great river, then being guided through his body's mana circulation, and finally being refined, bit by bit, into his own mana. [[2566 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Zhang Yu felt a thrill from the surge of mana. [[2567 张羽 happy]]
"So this is the true efficiency of a level 6 Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method?" [[2568 张羽 neutral]]
At this point, Zhang Yu finally understood that his usual cultivation had never fully unleashed the true power of his level 6 technique. [[2569 旁白 neutral]]
Now, with the help of the Qi Sea Spiritual Root, he was truly pushing the efficiency of the Zhou Tian Qi-Gathering Method to its limit. [[2570 旁白 neutral]]
Not daring to waste a single second, Zhang Yu focused entirely on absorbing spiritual energy and refining mana. [[2571 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, in the spiritual root rental office, the administrator who had helped Zhang Yu looked at her computer screen in surprise. "Huh? The spiritual energy concentration has dropped?" [[2572 管理员 neutral]]
The school's meditation rooms didn't just provide quiet; the spirit-gathering talismans arranged inside could control the concentration of spiritual energy in the room, improving cultivation effectiveness. [[2573 旁白 neutral]]
The administrator carefully checked the monitoring parameters and found that meditation room #2 was showing a significant spiritual energy convergence, drawing in a large amount from the surroundings and causing the concentration in the nearby rooms to drop. [[2574 旁白 neutral]]
"Room #2... I remember that new first-year student is using it, right?" [[2575 管理员 neutral]]
"This level of spiritual energy convergence... a first-year student can do this?" [[2576 管理员 neutral]]
The administrator was increasingly surprised. In her memory, only second-year students could use the Qi Sea Spiritual Root so effectively. [[2577 旁白 neutral]]
"Zhang Yu, was it?" [[2578 管理员 neutral]]
Recalling the name and class from the registration, the administrator made a mental note, revising the "stingy" label she had given him. [[2579 旁白 neutral]]
"To be so powerful as a first-year, this student must have spent a lot of money on cultivation." [[2580 管理员 neutral]]
As she activated more spirit-gathering talismans to restore the energy concentration, the administrator thought to herself, "I'll get his contact info later. If I can get him to sign up for a platinum membership, I won't have to worry about my sales quota for the next few months." [[2581 管理员 neutral]]
She decided not to tell anyone and to focus on developing this potential high-value customer herself. [[2582 旁白 neutral]]
An hour passed in a flash. [[2583 旁白 neutral]]
Immersed in the pleasure of the surging spiritual energy, Zhang Yu's mana had unknowingly increased from 9.4 to 9.5. This single hour was clearly worth half a day of his usual hard training. [[2584 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a female voice came through the room's intercom. [[2585 旁白 neutral]]
"Student Zhang Yu, your hour is almost up. Would you like to extend your time?" [[2586 管理员 neutral]]
For some reason, Zhang Yu felt the administrator's voice was much gentler than before. [[2587 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling the satisfaction of the surging spiritual energy and his technique running at full power, Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask, "How much to extend?" [[2588 张羽 neutral]]
The administrator quickly replied, "The rental price for the Qi Sea Spiritual Root is 5,000 per hour. But we have a promotion today for new users. If you deposit 100,000 at once, you'll not only get an extra 10,000, but also an 12% discount on rental fees." [[2589 管理员 happy]]
Zhang Yu sighed internally and slowly stopped his cultivation. "I have things to do today, so I won't extend." [[2590 张羽 sad]]
When he returned the spiritual root, Zhang Yu noticed the administrator was even more polite. He happened to have a question he wanted to ask. [[2591 旁白 neutral]]
With a reluctant glance at the Qi Sea Spiritual Root being placed back into its jade box, Zhang Yu asked, "If this spiritual root were for sale, how much would it cost?" [[2592 张羽 neutral]]
The administrator's eyes lit up. She smiled and said, "The price of the Qi Sea Spiritual Root is sixty million." [[2593 管理员 neutral]]
Zhang Yu took a sharp breath inwardly but kept his expression calm. "That expensive?" [[2594 张羽 neutral]]
The administrator smiled. "Yes. We don't really recommend buying it. Renting is much more cost-effective. After all, it's too extravagant to have a Heavenly Spiritual Root in the early Qi Refining stage. Most cultivators only consider buying one after they get into university." [[2595 管理员 neutral]]
Zhang Yu nodded slightly. He knew the final step to break through from the Qi Refining realm to the Foundation Establishment realm was to implant one's own spiritual root. That was indeed something for university students to worry about. [[2596 旁白 neutral]]
But whether one implanted a Heavenly, Earthly, or Human spiritual root depended entirely on the cultivator's financial resources. [[2597 旁白 neutral]]
As for the even higher-grade Divine and Immortal Spiritual Roots, those could only be obtained by joining special departments or great sects. [[2598 旁白 neutral]]
"A useful Heavenly Spiritual Root is... so damn expensive." [[2599 张羽 sad]]
Taking one last deep look at the spiritual root as it was put away, Zhang Yu thought to himself that one day, he would buy a spiritual root of his own. [[2600 旁白 neutral]]
Before he left, the administrator took the initiative to add him as a contact. Only then did Zhang Yu learn her name was Wei Xin. [[2601 旁白 neutral]]
Wei Xin silently changed Zhang Yu's contact name to "Zhang Yu (Platinum Member Prospect)." [[2602 旁白 neutral]]
