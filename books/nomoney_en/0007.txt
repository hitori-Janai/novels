Chapter 7: The Gap Between People [[773 旁白 neutral]]
On the bus. [[774 旁白 neutral]]
After getting the Feather Book, Zhang Yu thought his future life would be: "Feather Book! Let me see your limits!" [[775 旁白 neutral]]
Who knew it would instantly become... Ritual: "Zhang Yu! Let me see your limits!" [[776 旁白 neutral]]
But with things as they were, the only way Zhang Yu could think of to break the ritual's power was to become stronger. [[777 旁白 neutral]]
So for now, he could only cultivate diligently. [[778 旁白 neutral]]
With each breath, wisps of spiritual energy from the world flowed into his body, gathering in his dantian's sea of qi. It was refined drop by drop into mana, solidifying his cultivation foundation. [[779 旁白 neutral]]
However, thinking about practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms last night, Zhang Yu wanted to try the same method to see if he could quickly level up his Basic Breathing Technique. [[780 旁白 neutral]]
As the thought crossed his mind, the Feather Book opened. Zhang Yu focused his attention on 'Basic Breathing Technique Level 1' on the page and immediately dragged it. [[781 旁白 neutral]]
But just as he dragged 'Basic Breathing Technique Level 1' toward his character portrait, a flash of understanding emerged from the Feather Book. [[782 旁白 neutral]]
"You can only focus on improving one skill at a time." [[783 羽书 neutral]]
"Once you switch, you must wait a day before switching again." [[784 羽书 neutral]]
In his mind, Zhang Yu named this function of the Feather Book 'Specialization'. [[785 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, he understood that a specialized skill could be improved rapidly, but he could only specialize in one skill at a time and had to wait a day after switching before he could switch again. [[786 旁白 neutral]]
"So, if I switch my specialization from the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms to the Basic Breathing Technique, the breathing technique will improve quickly with practice, but the Body-Strengthening forms will go back to their normal training efficiency." [[787 张羽 neutral]]
"Unless I switch back to the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms after a day..." [[788 张羽 neutral]]
Thinking about the situation in PE class, Zhang Yu decided not to switch for now and to continue focusing on improving the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[789 旁白 neutral]]
Time passed in a flash, and Zhang Yu maintained his Basic Breathing Technique until the moment he got off the bus. [[790 旁白 neutral]]
... [[791 旁白 neutral]]
In the school cafeteria. [[792 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen, carrying her tray, sat down in front of a zombie-like Zhang Yu. She gave him a curious look and said coolly, "Were you busy all night?" [[793 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu wolfed down the large meat bun in his hand and grumbled, "I was working hard, training late into the night." [[794 张羽 angry]]
Bai Zhenzhen's face was expressionless, but her words were blunt. "Sigh, you're the only one in the whole school who hasn't had the sterilization surgery. I told you not to save that twenty thousand yuan. Look how much time, energy, and protein you've wasted." [[795 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu swallowed an egg in one bite and said with a confident smile, "Bai Zhenzhen, let me tell you something. Even I am amazed by my own self-discipline and potential now. It won't be long before I take your spot as number one in the grade." [[796 张羽 neutral]]
Hearing this, Bai Zhenzhen rolled her eyes and said bluntly, "Yu, it's fine to say such overconfident things to me, but if anyone else heard you, I'm afraid they'd laugh so hard they'd pee." [[797 白真真 neutral]]
"You're competing for first in the grade, not first in self-pleasure. Your un-sterilized advantage won't help you here." [[798 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu shook his head speechlessly, thinking, "This girl Zhenzhen, she acts so cold all the time, but in private, she dares to say anything." [[799 张羽 neutral]]
Speaking of being the only student in school who hadn't been sterilized, Zhang Yu wasn't that surprised anymore. He was gradually getting used to the madness of this damned world and school. [[800 旁白 neutral]]
However, not being sterilized was still a little secret of his, which he had only told Bai Zhenzhen among his classmates. [[801 旁白 neutral]]
But thinking about it now, a question suddenly popped into his mind: "Why was I allowed to enroll without having the surgery?" [[802 张羽 neutral]]
Just then, Zhou Tianyi also sat down with his tray, looking at Zhang Yu with curiosity. "You look exhausted. Did you study all night?" [[803 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu shook his head and said, "I practiced the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms for a bit and had a moment of insight." [[804 张羽 neutral]]
While they ate and chatted, Zhang Yu suddenly noticed that after Zhou Tianyi arrived, Bai Zhenzhen became much quieter, as if she had turned back into the cold, quiet top student. [[805 旁白 neutral]]
After breakfast, the three of them walked across the sports field toward the classroom building. [[806 旁白 neutral]]
From time to time, Zhang Yu would open his palm, watching the Feather Book appear and disappear. [[807 旁白 neutral]]
"So, no one else can see the Feather Book, right?" [[808 张羽 neutral]]
Just then, a loud bang came from the direction of the school building, followed by a series of shouts and screams. [[809 旁白 neutral]]
A crowd had already gathered in front of the main entrance of the building. A body with a smashed head lay quietly on the ground. [[810 旁白 neutral]]
The people around were murmuring, and someone had already recognized the body. [[811 旁白 neutral]]
Someone familiar with the deceased was sharing gossip. [[812 旁白 neutral]]
"That's Lu Chao from Senior 3, Class 3. He used to be in the honors class, right? I think his grades were slipping, and he was about to be moved to a lower class again." [[813 旁白 neutral]]
"Lu Chao? He was in the top ten of the grade back in Senior 2." [[814 旁白 neutral]]
Someone with a prejudice against the poor started a broad attack. [[815 旁白 neutral]]
"So what if his grades were good in Senior 2? The poor are poor. By Senior 3, how many poor students are left in the honors class? Poor people just aren't suited for cultivation." [[816 旁白 neutral]]
Someone with severe grade discrimination began their commentary. [[817 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmph, he died just from jumping from the sixth floor. What a loser. If it were a top student from the Senior 3 honors class, I bet they'd have to jump from at least the tenth floor to die." [[818 旁白 neutral]]
Passing by, Bai Zhenzhen looked at the scene and sighed, "Another Senior 3 student jumped?" [[819 白真真 sad]]
Zhou Tianyi said, "This is the third one this year, right? It seems like this year's Senior 3 class is under a lot of pressure." [[820 周天翊 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu suddenly asked, "Was he very poor?" [[821 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen glanced at him. It was unclear if she was advising or lamenting as she said flatly, "He probably took out a lot of loans. Anyone who has to borrow money for school is definitely not rich." [[822 白真真 neutral]]
"When students like him first enter Songyang High, their grades are often quite good." [[823 白真真 neutral]]
"But usually, by the time they reach Senior 3, they gradually fall behind their wealthy classmates. In the end, they can often only get into second or third-rate universities." [[824 白真真 neutral]]
"As for the Ten Greats, it seems like it's been over a decade since a commoner from Songyang High got accepted." [[825 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was stunned. He knew the "Ten Greats" referred to the universities directly under the Ten Great Sects, the top ten universities that countless students dreamed of. [[826 旁白 neutral]]
But he didn't know that no commoner from Songyang High had been accepted into the Ten Greats for over a decade. [[827 旁白 neutral]]
He thought to himself, "Is it because of a lack of resources and money?" [[828 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu recalled some rumors about the wealthy students. It was said that many top tutors, secret study materials, high-level techniques, and lab-made potions... only circulated within the circles of the rich and were never shared with the poor. [[829 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the splattered blood on the ground, Zhang Yu thought, "If my potential hadn't been unlocked, I might have ended up on the same path in the future." [[830 张羽 sad]]
Although the suicide caused a stir, for students busy with studying and cultivating every day, it was just something to talk about during their breaks. [[831 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, no one cared about it anymore. The students plunged back into their daily routine of cultivation studies, fighting for their futures. [[832 旁白 neutral]]
Even though they were only in their teens, everyone already knew a cruel fact. [[833 旁白 neutral]]
Different scores led to different universities. [[834 旁白 neutral]]
Different universities determined one's future sect. [[835 旁白 neutral]]
Different sects determined one's entire life. [[836 旁白 neutral]]
Whether they were friends or rivals, classmates with different scores would go their separate ways. [[837 旁白 neutral]]
... [[838 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, it was time for the three-period-long PE class. [[839 旁白 neutral]]
After once again refusing PE teacher Wang Hai's sales pitch, Zhang Yu wondered if it was his imagination, but he felt the way the teacher looked at him had changed. [[840 旁白 neutral]]
But he couldn't do anything about it. Due to both money and health concerns, he couldn't take the injections anymore. [[841 旁白 neutral]]
So Zhang Yu could only pretend not to notice and continue his practice. [[842 旁白 neutral]]
Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 2 (1/20) [[843 旁白 neutral]]
Counting the session before getting to school, Zhang Yu only needed to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms 19 more times to level up. [[844 旁白 neutral]]
This motivated him during his training, pushing him to activate his muscles again and again, draining every last bit of his mana. [[845 旁白 neutral]]
Even when he wanted to slow down and rest, the ritual's power would remind him to pull himself together and keep practicing. [[846 旁白 neutral]]
He pushed past his limits time and again, accompanied by the tearing pain in his muscles and the constant threat of death. It was both painful and joyful. [[847 旁白 neutral]]
After more than two class periods, Zhang Yu finally collapsed on the ground, not wanting to move an inch. [[848 旁白 neutral]]
Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 2 (17/20) [[849 旁白 neutral]]
"I've reached my limit." [[850 张羽 neutral]]
The ritual's power didn't force him further, apparently agreeing that he had reached his limit. [[851 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu wasn't discouraged at all. To level up a basic martial art from Level 1 to almost Level 3 in just two days was something his past self wouldn't have dared to imagine. [[852 旁白 happy]]
"If I hadn't done the extra training last night, I probably could have lasted all three PE periods, right?" [[853 张羽 neutral]]
"But with this damn ritual forcing me to train every second, I'm afraid it will become normal to train extra at night and then be too tired to train during PE class..." [[854 张羽 sad]]
Zhang Yu felt it was like his past life, where some people crammed and studied all night only to sleep through class during the day. It was obviously not a healthy routine. [[855 旁白 neutral]]
"It's all this stupid ritual's fault. It has no sense of time or place." [[856 张羽 angry]]
Just then, as he lay on the ground, Zhang Yu felt a shadow fall over him, as if a mountain was blocking the sun. [[857 旁白 neutral]]
Wang Hai looked down at Zhang Yu and said coldly, "It's PE class. What are you doing?" [[858 王海 angry]]
Zhang Yu quickly replied, "Teacher, I did extra training last night, so I'm a bit too tired to practice now." [[859 张羽 neutral]]
Sensing Wang Hai's displeasure, Zhang Yu added, "My Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms broke through last night. I'm at Level 2 now." [[860 张羽 neutral]]
He offered this explanation because he knew that in this grade-obsessed school, most teachers wouldn't bother students with good results. [[861 旁白 neutral]]
He thought that if Wang Hai knew he had made significant progress, he wouldn't give him a hard time. [[862 旁白 neutral]]
This was something Zhang Yu had started thinking about after vaguely sensing the change in Wang Hai's attitude toward him. [[863 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu was wrong. [[864 旁白 neutral]]
There are many kinds of teachers in this world. [[865 旁白 neutral]]
For example, most main subject teachers at Songyang High liked high-achieving students. They were easy to teach and gave a sense of accomplishment, so they were more tolerant of their mistakes. [[866 旁白 neutral]]
Other teachers poured more energy into underperforming students, focusing on improving their scores because it was easier to see improvement in them. [[867 旁白 neutral]]
Many elective teachers didn't care how their students did. They clocked in, taught, and clocked out, considering any extra second spent on work a loss. [[868 旁白 neutral]]
But there was another type of teacher who, more than their students' grades, cared about whether students were obedient and whether their authority was challenged. [[869 旁白 neutral]]
In this kind of teacher's class, their word was law. They would not tolerate any defiance from students. Even if you just used a method they hadn't taught, they would mock you and use you as a bad example. [[870 旁白 neutral]]
And clearly, Wang Hai, who liked to sell potions and use corporal punishment, was this type of teacher. [[871 旁白 neutral]]
PE class at Songyang High was his little kingdom, and the students were his sales channel for potions. [[872 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu's consistent refusal to buy his potions had already annoyed him. [[873 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Zhang Yu lying down and 'slacking off' made him even more dissatisfied. He wanted to use this as an opportunity to teach him a lesson and make an example out of him, to shame those who didn't take injections and discourage natural training like Zhang Yu's. [[874 旁白 neutral]]
But his planned lecture was cut short by Zhang Yu's statement, "My Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms broke through last night." [[875 旁白 neutral]]
In Wang Hai's eyes, this was a challenge to his authority in PE class. [[876 旁白 neutral]]
"So what if you're Level 2 in Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms?" [[877 王海 angry]]
Wang Hai pointed at Bai Zhenzhen and said, "Look at her. Did she stop taking injections after reaching Level 2? Does she slack off in class?" [[878 王海 angry]]
Zhang Yu said helplessly, "Teacher, that's not what I meant..." [[879 张羽 sad]]
Wang Hai said coldly, "Zhang Yu, I've seen plenty of students like you. You think you can ignore your teacher's guidance and the school's curriculum just because you have a little talent." [[880 王海 angry]]
"You need to understand that the only reason you broke through is because you have been diligently attending class and taking injections for the past three months. My guidance laid a solid foundation for you." [[881 王海 angry]]
"As for your self-study or tutoring outside of school, that's just dessert at best." [[882 王海 angry]]
"Only the classes here at school are the main course." [[883 王海 angry]]
"I will report your attitude to your homeroom teacher. You'd better watch yourself." [[884 王海 angry]]
