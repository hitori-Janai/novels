Chapter 9: Work [[965 旁白 neutral]]
After school that day. [[966 旁白 neutral]]
In the cafeteria. [[967 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu, Zhou Tianyi, and Bai Zhenzhen were sitting together eating dinner. [[968 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen was cold and silent as usual, calmly working her way through the large plate of food in front of her. [[969 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi glanced at Zhang Yu and said, "Your financial situation seems a bit rough lately." [[970 周天翊 neutral]]
"Is it that obvious?" [[971 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu froze for a moment, wondering if the debt collectors had already called his classmates. Did this mean his seven hundred thousand yuan debt was about to be exposed at school? [[972 旁白 neutral]]
Zhou Tianyi glanced at Bai Zhenzhen's lavish dinner, full of chicken, duck, and fish, then looked at Zhang Yu's five-yuan "poor man's meal." [[973 旁白 neutral]]
He stroked his chin and said, "Based on my observations of the cafeteria over the past three months, what a person eats can effectively reflect their financial situation and even their cultivation level during that time." [[974 周天翊 neutral]]
"For example, someone who eats ten pounds in one meal wouldn't sit at the same table as someone who eats three pounds." [[975 周天翊 neutral]]
"Because they're not in the same social class at all; they're at the top and bottom of the campus food chain." [[976 周天翊 neutral]]
"Oh, so it's because I'm eating less." Zhang Yu breathed a sigh of relief, thinking his status as super-poor was about to be exposed. [[977 旁白 neutral]]
He turned to Bai Zhenzhen, looking at the dozen chicken legs in her meal box with curiosity. "A-Zhen, those chicken legs look amazing. Let me try one." [[978 张羽 neutral]]
Without looking up, Bai Zhenzhen said, "Get lost." [[979 白真真 angry]]
Beside them, Zhou Tianyi smiled and picked a duck leg from his own bowl for Zhang Yu. "Zhenzhen had a really intense workout today, she must be starving. Here, try mine." [[980 周天翊 happy]]
"You're a true brother!" Zhang Yu gave Zhou Tianyi a thumbs-up, grabbing the duck leg and starting to chew on it. [[981 张羽 happy]]
Watching Zhang Yu devour the food, Zhou Tianyi smiled slightly. "If you're having money problems, I can lend you some." [[982 周天翊 neutral]]
Zhang Yu waved his hand and said, "No need, I'll figure it out myself." [[983 张羽 neutral]]
Even though he was drowning in debt, Zhang Yu had no intention of borrowing money from classmates. Besides, borrowing from them wouldn't solve a massive seven hundred thousand yuan debt. He needed a way to earn money consistently to pay it off. [[984 旁白 neutral]]
"I at least need to cover the monthly interest so the collectors don't escalate their methods." [[985 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu knew that the longer his payment was overdue, the more aggressive the collection agency would become, moving from online harassment to real-world threats, each step more severe than the last. [[986 旁白 neutral]]
"And then there's rent, utilities, food..." [[987 旁白 neutral]]
The thought gave him a headache. [[988 旁白 sad]]
After Zhou Tianyi left, Bai Zhenzhen suddenly spoke up, "Based on my observations of you and Zhou Tianyi over the past three months, he's exceptionally nice to you." [[989 白真真 neutral]]
"Is he?" [[990 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen chuckled. "When a guy smiles and gives a duck leg from his own bowl to another guy, in my sixteen years of life, I've only seen that happen in two situations." [[991 白真真 neutral]]
"One, they're father and son." [[992 白真真 neutral]]
"Two... hehehe..." [[993 白真真 neutral]]
Zhang Yu raised an eyebrow. "A-Zhen, you've been reading some interesting stuff." [[994 张羽 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen: "Yuzi, you don't have to be scared. In this school, you're the one with the power to take initiative." [[995 白真真 neutral]]
With that, Bai Zhenzhen pushed her food tray towards Zhang Yu. "Sigh, I can't eat anymore. You can have the leftovers. You're my dear son, after all." [[996 白真真 neutral]]
"Get lost." Zhang Yu snatched the tray, his eyes scanning the neatly arranged food, which was clearly untouched. [[997 张羽 neutral]]
Just as Zhang Yu looked up to thank her, he only saw Bai Zhenzhen's back as she left the cafeteria. [[998 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the cafeteria, Bai Zhenzhen's expression turned indifferent again. She thought to herself, "Yuzi, there's actually a third situation where this happens." [[999 旁白 neutral]]
Bai Zhenzhen turned to look at the steps of the cafeteria entrance, where a cafeteria worker was pouring leftovers from a swill bucket into a cat's bowl. [[1000 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1001 旁白 neutral]]
After leaving school, Zhang Yu started planning how to make money. [[1002 旁白 neutral]]
"My rent is one thousand five hundred, utilities are about two hundred a month, and the loan repayment is fifteen thousand a month..." [[1003 旁白 sad]]
"Hiss..." [[1004 旁白 sad]]
Thinking about it gave him another headache. [[1005 旁白 sad]]
"I need to earn at least twenty thousand a month. A regular job definitely won't cut it." [[1006 旁白 neutral]]
As the thought crossed his mind, the Feather Book opened in front of him. [[1007 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu [[1008 旁白 neutral]]
Dao Heart Level 1 [[1009 旁白 neutral]]
Mana [[1010 旁白 neutral]]
Physical Strength Level 0.84 [[1011 旁白 neutral]]
Martial Arts: Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 2 (17/20), Freestyle Combat Level 1, High School Basic Swordsmanship Level 0 [[1012 旁白 neutral]]
Dao Arts: Life-Nourishing Breathing Technique Level 1 [[1013 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the new entry 'High School Basic Swordsmanship Level 0', Zhang Yu thought back to his martial arts class today. [[1014 旁白 neutral]]
The so-called martial arts class was for learning various combat techniques, and 80 out of the 100 points were for practical combat. [[1015 旁白 neutral]]
First-year students were required to learn one unarmed and one armed combat martial art. [[1016 旁白 neutral]]
This High School Basic Swordsmanship was what he had learned in class today, but since he hadn't truly mastered it, it still showed as Level 0. [[1017 旁白 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu tried it for a moment and found that 'High School Basic Swordsmanship Level 0' could also be dragged. [[1018 旁白 neutral]]
He figured that if he specialized in this martial art, with his potential, he could master and level it up quickly. [[1019 旁白 neutral]]
After these thoughts quickly flashed through his mind, Zhang Yu continued to stare at his stats, thinking about what kind of job he could do. [[1020 旁白 neutral]]
"Although I've only just started on the path of cultivation, I'm still an official student of Songyang High School..." [[1021 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, Zhang Yu started using his phone to contact his old cram school. [[1022 旁白 neutral]]
The original Zhang Yu had attended this cram school for a year after junior high before getting into Songyang High School. [[1023 旁白 neutral]]
"The pay at this kind of cram school should be good, and since I'm a student at Songyang High, I should have an advantage." [[1024 旁白 neutral]]
But when he inquired, the teacher told him they were fully staffed and suggested he try other cram schools. [[1025 旁白 neutral]]
So, Zhang Yu started contacting other cram schools. [[1026 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello, I'd like to be a part-time tutor. I'm a first-year student at Songyang High School..." [[1027 张羽 neutral]]
"May I ask where you graduated from for elementary and junior high school?" [[1028 陌生人1 neutral]]
"No, I'm already an official student at Songyang High School!" [[1029 张羽 angry]]
"Sorry, but we have plenty of tutors with degrees from top high schools. For a first-year student like you looking for part-time work, parents place a lot of importance on your elementary and junior high school credentials." [[1030 陌生人1 neutral]]
After learning about Zhang Yu's elementary and junior high schools, the other party stopped replying. [[1031 旁白 neutral]]
After this conversation repeated five or six times, Zhang Yu gradually understood. [[1032 旁白 sad]]
"Damn it!" [[1033 张羽 angry]]
"Why are the requirements for elementary and junior high so high?" [[1034 张羽 angry]]
"Has the competition for tutoring jobs gotten this intense?" [[1035 张羽 angry]]
Zhang Yu felt as if his elementary and junior high school records were like ugly labels stamped on his face, making it incredibly difficult to even find a part-time tutoring job. [[1036 旁白 sad]]
So Zhang Yu had to temporarily give up on the cram school route and try his backup plan. [[1037 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll have to try temporary jobs first." [[1038 旁白 neutral]]
The original Zhang Yu had learned a bit about temporary work over the first three months of school. [[1039 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, this wasn't the kind of temporary work ordinary people found, but jobs for those who had already stepped onto the path of cultivation. [[1040 旁白 neutral]]
High school students made up a large portion of this group. After all, not every high schooler was rich, and a good number of them needed to earn their own money to lessen their family's burden or buy things they wanted. [[1041 旁白 neutral]]
And because high school students lacked a high school diploma and spent most of their time in class, they could usually only take on temporary part-time jobs. [[1042 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu had looked into this a bit over the past two days, so he immediately added an agent and asked if there was any work available. [[1043 旁白 neutral]]
"You're asking too late, all of today's jobs have been taken." [[1044 陌生人1 neutral]]
"Why don't you come over here and wait? You can grab a new job as soon as it comes up." [[1045 陌生人1 neutral]]
... [[1046 旁白 neutral]]
Half an hour later, Zhang Yu arrived at a small plaza. [[1047 旁白 neutral]]
From a distance, he could see many people scattered around the plaza, sitting or lying down. There were old and young, men and women. Some were napping on the ground, while others, wearing school uniforms, were meditating and breathing. [[1048 旁白 neutral]]
Following the address he was given, Zhang Yu found a human resources company in a corner of the plaza. [[1049 旁白 neutral]]
The company was small, with a storefront that looked like a real estate agency. Various crude job postings were taped to the dirty glass. [[1050 旁白 neutral]]
After glancing at the old sign, Zhang Yu pushed the door open and was hit by a thick wave of cigarette smoke, which made him frown. [[1051 旁白 neutral]]
Behind a messy desk, a middle-aged man who was smoking looked up. He glanced at Zhang Yu and said, "Are you the high school student who just called?" [[1052 老王 neutral]]
After Zhang Yu nodded, the man introduced himself as Lao Wang, the agent here. He took out a few sheets of paper and said, "Fill out the resume, I'll register you in a bit." [[1053 老王 neutral]]
Zhang Yu took it and saw that besides personal information, he had to fill in his learned martial and dao arts and their levels, as well as his school grades. [[1054 旁白 neutral]]
Handing the filled-out form to the man, Zhang Yu asked, "How long does it usually take to find a job? What's the pay like?" [[1055 张羽 neutral]]
Lao Wang scratched his messy hair and said casually, "The minimum is a few hundred an hour... but it's hard to say how long it'll take to find something. It's normal to go a week without work if you're unlucky." [[1056 老王 neutral]]
Zhang Yu thought to himself: "The pay is that high? If so, couldn't I work two or three hours a day to cover my loan payments and living expenses?" [[1057 旁白 happy]]
At this thought, Zhang Yu's heart filled with joy. [[1058 旁白 happy]]
But then he heard the man say that jobs were hard to find, so he asked curiously, "Why?" [[1059 张羽 neutral]]
He emphasized his status: "I'm in the top ten of my first-year class at a top high school. Is it still that difficult?" [[1060 张羽 neutral]]
Lao Wang smiled and pointed outside, "See those people in the plaza? Besides high school students like you, the rest are high school graduates." [[1061 老王 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was shocked and said in disbelief, "How is that possible? They've graduated from high school and are cultivators, but they're still looking for temporary work here?" [[1062 张羽 neutral]]
Lao Wang shrugged. "They didn't get into college. Not every high school student can." [[1063 老王 neutral]]
"If you don't get into college, you'll be stuck in the Qi Refining stage for life, you can't get to the second layer of Kunxu, so you can only struggle here on the first layer year after year..." [[1064 老王 neutral]]
Zhang Yu was still confused. "But they could still find a full-time job on the first layer. Why do temporary work?" [[1065 张羽 neutral]]
Lao Wang explained, "They don't need to sleep. After finishing their day job, if the company doesn't require overtime, they come here to find some temporary work." [[1066 老王 neutral]]
"Otherwise, how would they pay back their loans? How would they have enough money to maintain their cultivation?" [[1067 老王 neutral]]
This revelation sent waves through Zhang Yu's mind. He never knew high school graduates had it so tough. [[1068 旁白 neutral]]
He had always imagined that even if they didn't get into college, they would work in an office in a downtown skyscraper, enjoying air conditioning, drinking tea, and earning a decent salary... [[1069 旁白 neutral]]
But it turns out they study 24 hours a day before graduation and work 24 hours a day after. The suffering just keeps piling on. [[1070 旁白 sad]]
Lao Wang looked at Zhang Yu's resume and smiled. "Oh, from Songyang High. We're alumni then. I also went to Songyang, but I dropped out in my third year." [[1071 老王 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Dropped out?" [[1072 张羽 neutral]]
Lao Wang shrugged. "Couldn't get into college, so I figured I shouldn't waste any more money. I just paid off my high school loans the year before last." [[1073 老王 neutral]]
"Since we're alumni, let me give you some advice." [[1074 老王 neutral]]
"In high school, know your limits. If you feel like you can't make it, get out early. Don't be like some people who get into too much debt and ruin their lives." [[1075 老王 neutral]]
After filling out the information, the man told Zhang Yu to wait outside and that he would be notified immediately if a job came up. [[1076 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu: "Competing with those high school graduates, will I even get a chance at a job?" [[1077 张羽 sad]]
Lao Wang: "Don't worry, some jobs are specifically for current high school students." [[1078 老王 neutral]]
