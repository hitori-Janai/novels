Chapter 10: Fierce Competition and Level 3 Body-Strengthening [[1080 旁白 neutral]]
Finding a random spot to sit, Zhang Yu watched the crowd also waiting for work in the square and felt a wave of exhaustion. [[1081 旁白 sad]]
"This damn place is so hard to survive in. Isn't there a single place that isn't a rat race?" [[1082 张羽 angry]]
He had only been resting on the ground for a moment when a sudden chill crept into his heart. [[1083 旁白 neutral]]
"Please adhere to the ritual's agreement. Strive to complete your wish. Do not deliberately slack off or delay. 10." [[1084 邪神 angry]]
"Damn it." [[1085 张羽 angry]]
Zhang Yu cursed inwardly, but under the pressure from the ritual's power, he had no choice but to get back to the grind. [[1086 旁白 sad]]
However, considering his body hadn't fully recovered and the work he might get would require stamina, he decided not to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. Instead, he chose to refine his mana with the basic breathing method. [[1087 旁白 neutral]]
With each inhale and exhale, wisps of spiritual energy from the world quickly gathered, converging in his Dantian's sea of qi, where he refined them drop by drop into mana. [[1088 旁白 neutral]]
Time trickled by as Zhang Yu focused on his breathing, and an hour soon passed. [[1089 旁白 neutral]]
In that hour, three different groups had come to hire workers: one for temporary security, one for a construction site needing cultivators for heavy labor, and one for a delivery company hiring cultivators for sorting. [[1090 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu gradually understood that most temporary jobs for Qi Refining cultivators were related to manual labor. [[1091 旁白 neutral]]
After all, cultivators in the Qi Refining stage had no significant advantage over mortals in intelligence or knowledge, but their physical fitness was a hundred times better. They could excel in construction, factories, security, and other jobs, with production efficiency far exceeding that of ordinary people. [[1092 旁白 neutral]]
So, many places needing to urgently increase their workforce would come here to hire cultivators. [[1093 旁白 neutral]]
Although the pay for cultivators was much higher than for ordinary people, it was still cost-effective. [[1094 旁白 neutral]]
After all, if one cultivator could do the work of 30 ordinary people, you usually only had to pay them ten times more. [[1095 旁白 neutral]]
And everyone waiting in this square was a super beast of burden, capable of working 007. [[1096 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to them, Zhang Yu, who still needed four or five hours of sleep, was just an ordinary high schooler who could still fall asleep. [[1097 旁白 sad]]
So, after seeing the rush of people scrambling for every job, Zhang Yu simply maintained his breathing exercises and didn't join the fray. [[1098 旁白 neutral]]
He knew that as a first-year high school student, he couldn't compete with those who had already graduated. [[1099 旁白 sad]]
He was waiting, waiting for the kind of job Lao Wang had mentioned, one specifically for currently enrolled high school students. [[1100 旁白 neutral]]
A few other high school students were doing the same as Zhang Yu. Some were reading, some were practicing breathing, and some were practicing martial arts. None of them went up to compete for jobs; they just waited quietly. [[1101 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, another hour passed. [[1102 旁白 neutral]]
Snap! Pop! Crack! [[1103 旁白 neutral]]
A series of small explosions echoed in the air. [[1104 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling that his body had rested enough, Zhang Yu began to practice the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[1105 旁白 neutral]]
The people around him glanced over but paid no mind. Too many people cultivated while waiting for work, and a basic technique like the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms couldn't possibly attract their attention. [[1106 旁白 neutral]]
Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 2 (18/20) [[1107 旁白 neutral]]
Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 2 (19/20) [[1108 旁白 neutral]]
After practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms twice, Zhang Yu felt his muscles begin to ache, but his spirits were higher than ever, because just one more time would bring it to Level 3. [[1109 旁白 happy]]
This was something that even Bai Zhenzhen, the top-ranked student in the grade, hadn't achieved. [[1110 旁白 happy]]
And he had managed it in just two days. [[1111 旁白 happy]]
Just as Zhang Yu was starting his third practice of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, a temporary job for high school students finally arrived. [[1112 旁白 neutral]]
A small car drove to the front of the square, the window rolled down, and the driver shouted, "Any first or second years? I'm hiring two martial arts sparring partners." [[1113 司机 neutral]]
A martial arts sparring partner was someone hired to assist a cultivator in their combat training according to specific requirements. [[1114 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing the driver's words, the high school students who had been waiting quietly all sprang into action, moving like blurs and rushing towards the car with the sound of wind and thunder. [[1115 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm a second year!" [[1116 陌生男1 happy]]
"My physical strength is 2.15!" [[1117 陌生男2 happy]]
The second-year students were far ahead of the first-years in physical strength. By the time Zhang Yu rushed over, he found that the spots in front of the driver were all occupied by big guys, and he couldn't squeeze through. [[1118 旁白 sad]]
Zhang Yu thought to himself, "So many people are rushing to get beaten up. Have they no self-respect as high school students?" [[1119 张羽 angry]]
The driver scanned the students with their hands raised and asked, "Any from key high schools?" [[1120 司机 neutral]]
More than half of the hands went down. [[1121 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu quickly raised his hand, "I'm from Songyang High School!" [[1122 张羽 happy]]
The driver asked again, "Anyone with a practical combat skill at level 3 or above?" [[1123 司机 neutral]]
Looking at the remaining three, the driver asked again, "Three hundred an hour, you in?" [[1124 司机 neutral]]
A student with a buzz cut said, dissatisfied, "Isn't three hundred a bit too low?" [[1125 陌生男3 angry]]
But another student next to him eagerly said, "I'll do it for three hundred!" [[1126 陌生男4 happy]]
Watching the car speed away after the other student got in, the buzz-cut student cursed, "Three hundred an hour. Who the hell do they think they are." [[1127 陌生男3 angry]]
"Three hundred to hire a sparring partner? If you can't afford it, don't hire one." [[1128 陌生男3 angry]]
Someone else joined in, "He took 300? Scab! When that kid gets injured, he'll find out that 300 isn't even enough for medical bills." [[1129 陌生男5 angry]]
As the employer left, the surrounding students dispersed after a round of cursing, each returning to their own cultivation or studies. [[1130 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu could only go back and continue practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[1131 旁白 sad]]
If things continued like this, he felt he might not find a job today. [[1132 旁白 sad]]
About ten minutes later, someone else drove up to hire high school students, specifically asking for first-years. [[1133 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, the job was drug testing, supposedly for a new drug developed for cultivation beginners in a lab. [[1134 旁白 neutral]]
Considering his physical condition, Zhang Yu didn't even bother applying. He continued with his 20th repetition of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[1135 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, with a final crack, Zhang Yu threw the last punch of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms, successfully raising the skill to the third level. [[1136 旁白 happy]]
Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 3 (0/30) [[1137 旁白 happy]]
At that moment, countless memories of practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms flooded into Zhang Yu's mind, making him feel as if he had practiced it thousands of times. [[1138 旁白 neutral]]
And among these practices, there was not just the memory of flesh and blood, but also the memory of mana circulating on its own within his body. [[1139 旁白 neutral]]
"Upon reaching Level 3, practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms can simultaneously stimulate the circulation of mana, accelerating the repair and enhancement of the body." [[1140 旁白 neutral]]
If the first and second levels of the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms were about damaging the body during practice to forcibly squeeze out mana, [[1141 旁白 neutral]]
Then reaching the third level meant the movements themselves would guide mana to flow throughout the body, nourishing the flesh during exercise and greatly improving the training effect. [[1142 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, as Zhang Yu began a new round of practice, a warm current flowed through his limbs with his movements, silently increasing his physical strength, transforming him step by step from an ordinary person into a superhuman. [[1143 旁白 happy]]
Nourished by the warm current, the muscles that had begun to ache and feel sore now felt much more relaxed, allowing him to persist in his training more easily. [[1144 旁白 happy]]
Suddenly, Zhang Yu felt his muscles contract and expand. [[1145 旁白 neutral]]
Physical Strength 0.84 → 0.85 [[1146 旁白 happy]]
Glancing at the change in his physical strength on the Feather Book, a flash of joy crossed Zhang Yu's mind. [[1147 张羽 happy]]
At this moment, even without the urging of the ritual's power, he felt energized and continued to train. [[1148 张羽 happy]]
While Zhang Yu was cultivating, the recruitment for the drug trial was still ongoing. [[1149 旁白 neutral]]
However, not many first-year students were willing to try a job like drug testing. [[1150 旁白 neutral]]
Although the recruiter wanted to hire five students, they only managed to get two after a long time and then left. [[1151 旁白 neutral]]
As time went on, the night grew deeper, and fewer employers came to hire. Zhang Yu still hadn't found a job and could only continue practicing the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms. [[1152 旁白 sad]]
Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms Level 3 (6/30) [[1153 旁白 neutral]]
When Zhang Yu had practiced the Body-Strengthening Thirty-Six Forms for the sixth time, he felt he couldn't just wait around anymore. [[1154 旁白 sad]]
Zhang Yu walked back into the human resources company and saw Lao Wang still sitting behind the desk, as if he hadn't moved for the past few hours. [[1155 旁白 neutral]]
He took out a pack of cigarettes he had bought, handed one to him, and asked, "Brother Wang, is there any work I can do?" [[1156 张羽 neutral]]
Lao Wang glanced at the cigarette Zhang Yu offered and said nonchalantly, "Didn't I tell you? They'll call outside if there's work." [[1157 老王 neutral]]
But Zhang Yu persisted, "I mean besides the jobs outside." [[1158 张羽 neutral]]
"There's no way all the temporary jobs in Songyang City are recruited from here, right? Are there any others?" [[1159 张羽 neutral]]
Pestered by Zhang Yu, Lao Wang said impatiently, "See for yourself. It's not that I don't want you to work, but are those other temp jobs really that easy to get?" [[1160 老王 angry]]
Zhang Yu looked at a screenshot on the man's phone, which listed rows of long-term recruitment positions. [[1161 旁白 neutral]]
There were long-term drug trials after signing a contract. [[1162 旁白 neutral]]
There was long-term participation as a test subject for cultivation technique research. [[1163 旁白 neutral]]
There was also work as an assistant for exploration teams deep in the underground of Kunxu. [[1164 旁白 neutral]]
And there was assisting the police in fighting criminals. [[1165 旁白 neutral]]
Looking through the list, Zhang Yu found them either too dangerous, or both dangerous and impossible for him to do. [[1166 旁白 sad]]
"These long-term jobs that are never filled are really all traps." [[1167 张羽 sad]]
Suddenly, Zhang Yu looked at one of the listings and asked, "Brother Wang, what are the dangers of participating in cultivation technique research?" [[1168 张羽 neutral]]
Lao Wang said casually, "You're the test dummy. You test the new techniques developed by big corporations. They record what side effects you have, what injuries you sustain, where you become disabled, and how you eventually die..." [[1169 老王 neutral]]
Zhang Yu swallowed hard, then his eyes lit up as he looked at another temporary job and asked, "What about this introductory technique trial? Ten thousand yuan for one time? Why does it only recruit first-year high school students?" [[1170 张羽 happy]]
Lao Wang thought for a moment, then said, "Oh, that one. I think the Xianyun Group developed a technique that's already been tested. It has no side effects and won't kill you." [[1171 老王 neutral]]
"But the initiation process is too difficult. If you fail, you can easily suffer internal injuries, so they're always looking for people to test it." [[1172 老王 neutral]]
"Because it's a technique intended for cultivation beginners, they specifically look for first-year high school students to test it..." [[1173 老王 neutral]]
At this point, he looked at Zhang Yu, who was listening intently, and frowned. "You're not thinking of doing this, are you? The last student who went got his mana out of control, suffered internal injuries, and had to take two weeks off from school and still hasn't recovered." [[1174 老王 neutral]]
"That ten thousand yuan isn't easy money." [[1175 老王 neutral]]
Zhang Yu shrugged helplessly, "I can't help it. I need the money urgently, so I have to give it a try." [[1176 张羽 sad]]
