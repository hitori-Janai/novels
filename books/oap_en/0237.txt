Chapter 237: Hidden Affection (Extra chapter for Mengmeng) [[20318 旁白 neutral]]
Even if it was so humble, Su Tao was willing. [[20319 旁白 neutral]]
As long as... as long as her relationship with Xiaocheng could go back to how it was, she would do anything! [[20320 旁白 happy]]
She looked at Chi Xiaocheng with anticipation, hoping for the girl's permission. Even without a word, just a slight nod would be enough. [[20321 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng didn't answer her. She just handed over the skewer with the last half-eaten candied hawthorn. [[20322 旁白 neutral]]
I don't want to eat it anymore. [[20323 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao took the candied hawthorn, looking at the half with a faint row of teeth marks, and couldn't help but sigh inwardly. [[20324 旁白 sad]]
As she thought, a candied hawthorn was too plain as a gift. And it seemed the ones from this stall weren't very good—not sweet enough. Xiaocheng didn't like it at all. [[20325 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao took the remaining half and asked softly, If you don't want to eat it, should I throw it away? [[20326 苏桃 neutral]]
As soon as she said this, both Chi Xiaocheng and the System in her mind fell silent. [[20327 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, she's so dense.] [[20328 系统 neutral]]
Why do you think she's so hard to capture? [[20329 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng even suspected that without the influence of the world's will and the original author's control, a Su Tao so clueless about romance would never have been fooled by those male leads. [[20330 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling speechless, Chi Xiaocheng put on an act, sounding a little unhappy, It's for you to eat. [[20331 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment, then smiled. You're right, it's too wasteful to throw it away. [[20332 苏桃 happy]]
She bit into the half piece of candied hawthorn. It was incredibly sweet. [[20333 旁白 neutral]]
Didn't Xiaocheng say it tasted just okay and wasn't sweet at all? [[20334 旁白 neutral]]
While she was dazed, she heard a familiar question, Is it sweet? [[20335 池小橙 neutral]]
The tone was just like when she used to act cute. [[20336 旁白 neutral]]
Except, the name Taotao was missing from the beginning. [[20337 旁白 sad]]
But even so, hearing this sweet question, beautiful memories from the past flooded her mind. [[20338 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao wiped the corner of her eye, a happy smile on her lips. Sweet... [[20339 苏桃 happy]]
It wasn't the candied hawthorn that was sweet, it was her. [[20340 旁白 happy]]
The person she liked, right in front of her. [[20341 旁白 happy]]
After savoring the candied hawthorn, Su Tao took out her phone and asked gently, Well Xiaocheng, since we have time now, should we... video call your aunt and uncle? They said they missed you when you were sick. [[20342 苏桃 neutral]]
It's so late, Mom and Dad must be asleep already, right? [[20343 池小橙 neutral]]
That's true. I'll send a message to ask. [[20344 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly looked down and typed a message to Father Chi. [[20345 旁白 neutral]]
She had promised the elders a few days ago that she and Xiaocheng would video chat. Now that the misunderstanding was finally clearing up, she didn't want to delay any longer and make them worry. [[20346 旁白 neutral]]
A moment after she sent the message, a reply came back immediately. [[20347 旁白 neutral]]
They said to wait a few minutes. [[20348 苏桃 neutral]]
Okay. [[20349 池小橙 neutral]]
Of course, Father and Mother Chi weren't asleep. They were still busy preparing for work the next day. [[20350 旁白 neutral]]
But after suddenly getting Su Tao's message, the two of them looked at their somewhat dirty clothes. [[20351 旁白 neutral]]
They immediately rushed into their room. [[20352 旁白 neutral]]
Old man, wear that one, the one I bought you last year. Don't hide it away, make sure you look good, okay? [[20353 池小橙's mother happy]]
I know, I know. You shouldn't wear that patched-up coat either. Taotao bought you a new one the year before last, you should wear it. [[20354 池小橙's father happy]]
I wear it every year, okay? And Ah Cai, come see Xiaocheng. [[20355 池小橙's mother happy]]
Woof! [[20356 阿财 happy]]
Parents always want to show their best side to their children. By the time the elders were done getting ready, almost ten minutes had passed. [[20357 旁白 neutral]]
They moved from the kitchen to the bed, turned the lights on brightly, and snuggled together like a loving old couple ready to rest. [[20358 旁白 happy]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng was doing the same as her parents. [[20359 旁白 neutral]]
She moved to the side of the bed and patted it. Don't just stand there. Take off your shoes and your coat, and come sit here. [[20360 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't quite understand what Chi Xiaocheng meant. It's not right for me to get on the hospital bed, is it? [[20361 苏桃 neutral]]
Are you dense? Do you want Mom and Dad to know we were fighting? Even if you have to pretend, you need to act like you like me a lot. Get over here! [[20362 池小橙 angry]]
Her voice became forceful, like a superior giving an order. [[20363 旁白 neutral]]
But didn't you say you're uncomfortable being close to me right now? [[20364 苏桃 sad]]
This is an exception. If you keep dawdling, I'll really start to dislike you. [[20365 池小橙 angry]]
Oh, okay. [[20366 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded quickly, but her heart started to beat uncontrollably. [[20367 旁白 happy]]
Even though... even though it was just pretending to be close for her aunt and uncle's sake. [[20368 旁白 neutral]]
But... she hadn't hugged Xiaocheng in a very, very long time! [[20369 旁白 happy]]
Feeling nervous, Su Tao's movements were a bit awkward. [[20370 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could only sit aside and direct her with a helpless sigh. [[20371 旁白 neutral]]
Get under the covers, lean back against the pillow, just like you do at home. [[20372 池小橙 neutral]]
O... okay. [[20373 苏桃 neutral]]
And make your movements a little bigger. How are you going to hug me like that? [[20374 池小橙 neutral]]
Huh? Hug you? [[20375 苏桃 neutral]]
We're sisters, and we're on a video call. Do you want Mom and Dad to know we aren't getting along? [[20376 池小橙 neutral]]
Mhm, mhm. [[20377 苏桃 happy]]
Hold me tighter!!! [[20378 池小橙 angry]]
Both sides were deliberately creating a good atmosphere. Father and Mother Chi didn't want their two daughters studying far away to worry about the situation at home. [[20379 旁白 neutral]]
Although Chi Xiaocheng had the same idea, she... had her own selfish reasons. [[20380 旁白 neutral]]
Even though her plan was to distance herself from Taotao first, increase her possessiveness, and then get together with her. [[20381 旁白 neutral]]
But... she really wanted to be held after all. [[20382 旁白 happy]]
She missed the warm and comfortable feeling, was addicted to her faint, fresh scent, listening to her whisper relaxing stories, enjoying the touch of her hand on her head, and the constant care as she smoothed her hair. [[20383 旁白 happy]]
Sorry, Taotao. I can only use this little trick to keep possessing you for a short while. [[20384 旁白 sad]]
The video call hadn't even connected yet, but Chi Xiaocheng's face already showed a hint of enjoyment. [[20385 旁白 happy]]
Her ultimate acting skills had finally cracked. [[20386 旁白 neutral]]
Longing and affection were impossible to fake. [[20387 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, she had taken an emotion-dulling pill earlier, so she wouldn't just turn around and throw herself into Taotao's arms. [[20388 旁白 neutral]]
Her remaining intermediate acting skills allowed Chi Xiaocheng to maintain her facial expression. [[20389 旁白 neutral]]
With a ding-dong, Father Chi started the video call, and Chi Xiaocheng reached out her small hand to answer. [[20390 旁白 neutral]]
She turned to Su Tao, her voice carrying a slight warning, Act like you normally like me, you know? Pretend however you want, just don't keep staring at my face. Look at the camera! [[20391 池小橙 neutral]]
O... okay! [[20392 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao nodded lightly, her nose twitching as she greedily enjoyed the unique scent of Chi Xiaocheng. [[20393 旁白 happy]]
Her eyes were full of adoration. [[20394 旁白 happy]]
For nearly two months, even at home, in Chi Xiaocheng's room, in her bed, her scent had long since faded. [[20395 旁白 sad]]
The sachet she always carried with her originally had Xiaocheng's scent too. [[20396 旁白 sad]]
But as more time passed since Xiaocheng's death, the sachet's scent also disappeared. [[20397 旁白 sad]]
It had become a cold object for holding memories. [[20398 旁白 sad]]
But now... [[20399 旁白 happy]]
That familiar scent, touch, voice, softness—it was all right here, held in her arms. [[20400 旁白 happy]]
Xiaocheng Xiaocheng Xiaocheng Xiaocheng Xiaocheng Xiaocheng Xiaocheng Xiaocheng Xiaocheng... [[20401 苏桃 happy]]
--I love you. [[20402 苏桃 happy]]
