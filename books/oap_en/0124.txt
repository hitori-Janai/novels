Chapter 124: Suicide Note [[10946 旁白 neutral]]
"Suicide Note" [[10947 旁白 neutral]]
—To my dearest, dearest, dearest Taotao. [[10948 池小橙 sad]]
When you read this, I'll probably already be asleep. [[10949 池小橙 sad]]
Falling into a deep dream, unable to bother you anymore. [[10950 池小橙 sad]]
I used to think that love was something you could chase after, that loving you was a big party. [[10951 池小橙 sad]]
Like fireworks in the night sky, short but beautiful. [[10952 池小橙 sad]]
I think I must be sick. Maybe I haven't been normal for a long time, always making trouble for you. I can feel it all. [[10953 池小橙 sad]]
I don't want to make you upset or sad. I don't want to get in the way of your life, so I listened to you and tried to be good. [[10954 池小橙 sad]]
I thought if I did that, you would care about me and like me, but I found you were just getting further away. [[10955 池小橙 sad]]
I gathered my courage to tell you how I feel, wanting to hide myself in your eyes, but I realized it was all just one-sided. [[10956 池小橙 sad]]
I remember when we were little, you pulled me out of the darkness. I kept it a secret from everyone and gave you my chains. [[10957 池小橙 sad]]
From then on, I had a reason to only have eyes for you. [[10958 池小橙 sad]]
But I know you don't like me. The light in your eyes has nothing to do with me. The moments I wanted to share were just small things to you. [[10959 池小橙 sad]]
I disturbed your life, like an uninvited breeze that messed up your peaceful days. [[10960 池小橙 sad]]
I thought my strong feelings could touch you, but I didn't know my obsession was just a burden in your life. [[10961 池小橙 sad]]
After a while, I didn't know if you were running away from me, or if you had been against it from the start. [[10962 池小橙 sad]]
I'm not stupid. I can feel you brushing me off and avoiding me. [[10963 池小橙 sad]]
But you wanted me to be a little fool, so I would keep depending on you. [[10964 池小橙 sad]]
Even though I was very careful, what I didn't want to happen still happened. [[10965 池小橙 sad]]
Your father is back, you have your fiancé, you have your work, friends, teacher, and family. You have your own life, and I'm not an essential part of it. [[10966 池小橙 sad]]
I... I'm probably just a passerby. [[10967 池小橙 sad]]
After all, I can't give you anything except stand here uselessly, watching you. [[10968 池小橙 sad]]
Lost in a role-playing game, trying in all sorts of ways to prove how much I care about you. [[10969 池小橙 sad]]
But all I got in return was you running away. [[10970 池小橙 sad]]
I can't get over how happy I was when it was just the two of us. But thinking about it, I'm better off alone. [[10971 池小橙 sad]]
That way, no one will get hurt. [[10972 池小橙 sad]]
Now that it's really time to leave, I feel so empty. I'm anxious, but I'm also afraid I'll regret this. [[10973 池小橙 sad]]
I can give up many things, but I can't give up on the one-sided chance of meeting you. [[10974 池小橙 sad]]
I wondered if I was important to you. But our fight during summer vacation, the marriage letter from far away, and your rejection made me realize it was all in my head. [[10975 池小橙 sad]]
Of course, I don't blame you. It's just... I'm too weak. [[10976 池小橙 sad]]
I want to go back to where we first met and hide far away. That way, I would have never met you, and my chains wouldn't cause you pain. [[10977 池小橙 sad]]
I like the way you look shy and confused. [[10978 池小橙 sad]]
The way your eyes are talking but I don't know what they're saying. [[10979 池小橙 sad]]
The way you look like you want to destroy the world when I wake you up late at night. [[10980 池小橙 sad]]
The way you feel helpless with me but can't bear to leave me. [[10981 池小橙 sad]]
The way you'll be full of joy in our next life when you meet a better-behaved me. [[10982 池小橙 sad]]
The way you are in my dreams. [[10983 池小橙 sad]]
Goodnight. [[10984 池小橙 sad]]
—Your Xiao (crossed out). [[10985 池小橙 sad]]
—Xiaocheng. [[10986 池小橙 sad]]
... [[10987 旁白 neutral]]
In the living room, you could hear a pin drop. The doctors in the bathroom were still trying to save Chi Xiaocheng from death. [[10988 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao held the suicide note as large teardrops fell onto the paper. [[10989 苏桃 sad]]
The pain in her heart was at its peak, her mind filled with scenes from the letter. [[10990 苏桃 sad]]
It was suffocating, like a rising tide. [[10991 苏桃 sad]]
It turned out Xiaocheng wasn't clueless; she had felt her avoidance all along. [[10992 苏桃 sad]]
She just never showed it, pretending to listen to her, thinking that would be enough to make her stay. [[10993 苏桃 sad]]
No wonder she asked that question on the bridge. [[10994 苏桃 sad]]
The funny thing was, she actually thought Xiaocheng's "yandere" tendencies were getting better. [[10995 苏桃 sad]]
In reality, she was suppressing herself, acting so strangely, just because she had once said she preferred her to be well-behaved. [[10996 苏桃 sad]]
Even in her final signature, "Your Xiaocheng," she had crossed out the word "Your." [[10997 苏桃 sad]]
Yes, separated forever. [[10998 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng no longer belongs to me. [[10999 苏桃 sad]]
Hahahahaha... [[11000 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao, oh Su Tao, you brought this on yourself! [[11001 苏桃 sad]]
News about her father, a marriage letter... they were from someone she'd never even met, yet she listened to that Xiao Ming's nonsense because she wanted a little fatherly love and the feeling of family. [[11002 苏桃 angry]]
Wasn't Xiaocheng her important family too! [[11003 苏桃 angry]]
If she hadn't gone to find that Xiao Ming, if she had listened to Dongfang Yang and come back sooner, or if she had just come back with Xiaocheng from the police station. [[11004 苏桃 sad]]
Even if it was just one minute, or ten seconds earlier. [[11005 苏桃 sad]]
Would the ending have been different? [[11006 苏桃 sad]]
"I'm the one who harmed Xiaocheng." [[11007 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao clutched the letter in her hand, her voice pained and hoarse. [[11008 旁白 neutral]]
She leaned against the sofa and closed her eyes, either remembering or regretting. [[11009 旁白 neutral]]
Even the usually talkative Dongfang Yang was silent. [[11010 旁白 neutral]]
He sat next to Su Tao, reading the letter with her. Although he didn't read all of it, he understood the general situation. [[11011 东方阳 sad]]
She had an emotional breakdown because of their argument, and then found out about the marriage letter and the fiancé, thinking Su Tao didn't want her or care about her anymore, so she chose to leave alone. [[11012 东方阳 sad]]
Dongfang Yang's heart felt heavy. He couldn't help but picture the small figure in the cafe, sweetly calling him "boss" with a smile. [[11013 东方阳 sad]]
He had only looked away for a moment, and now things were completely different. [[11014 东方阳 sad]]
Could he blame Su Tao? [[11015 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng already had some signs of schizophrenia; she was prone to overthinking. [[11016 东方陽 neutral]]
If anyone was to blame, it was that marriage letter and that guy Xiao Ming. That was the last straw. [[11017 东方阳 angry]]
He just hadn't expected it. Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao had only grown up together, with no blood relation. [[11018 东方阳 neutral]]
Their bond was this strong. [[11019 东方阳 neutral]]
"What a complete idiot." [[11020 东方阳 sad]]
It's not like nobody wants you. If you like this young master so much, you could have just said so. It's not like I can't support you. [[11021 东方阳 sad]]
Dongfang Yang sighed so quietly only he could hear, and glanced toward the bathroom, then quickly looked away. [[11022 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't want to see Chi Xiaocheng covered in blood. [[11023 旁白 sad]]
He heard Su Tao's helpless and lost voice, "Dongfang Yang, what am I going to do now?" [[11024 苏桃 sad]]
Without Xiaocheng. [[11025 苏桃 sad]]
You could even say Xiaocheng left because of her. [[11026 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao had never realized it before, but Chi Xiaocheng was a huge part of her motivation to keep living! [[11027 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang stood up, hiding his own weakness. He said in a deep voice, "Don't give up. Let's hear what the doctors have to say first." [[11028 东方阳 neutral]]
Just then, a female doctor in her 40s walked out of the bathroom. [[11029 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang patted Su Tao's shoulder. She didn't even have time to wipe away her tears. [[11030 旁白 neutral]]
Clinging to the last, desperate bit of hope, she asked, "D-doctor, how is she?" [[11031 苏桃 sad]]
