Chapter 113: An Unexpected Turn of Events [[9844 旁白 neutral]]
"Shopping?" [[9845 池小橙 neutral]]
"Aren't we going on a date?" [[9846 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sharply caught the key word Su Tao had used. [[9847 旁白 neutral]]
Her small mouth fell slightly open, her eyes a bit dazed, and the light in them dimmed a little. [[9848 旁白 sad]]
But when Su Tao took her hand, Chi Xiaocheng quickly smiled. [[9849 旁白 happy]]
And she added a thought to herself in her heart. [[9850 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao probably didn't realize. It definitely wasn't on purpose." [[9851 池小橙 neutral]]
"Today, I'll just listen to Taotao and enjoy our date." [[9852 池小橙 happy]]
After three straight days of heavy snow, today was a rare, beautiful day. [[9853 旁白 neutral]]
The sky was clear and the sun was shining brightly. [[9854 旁白 happy]]
The sunlight broke through the winter cold and swept away the trace of unease in Chi Xiaocheng's heart. [[9855 旁白 happy]]
Walking out of the residential complex to a temporary parking spot by the road, an orange convertible sports car was parked quietly, its cool appearance making it the dream car of countless men. [[9856 旁白 neutral]]
Beside the sports car, several people were taking pictures from a distance, but no one dared to get close. [[9857 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at Su Tao, "So, Taotao likes things a bit flashy?" [[9858 池小橙 neutral]]
She looked down and wondered, did this mean her soft and cute persona needed to be a little more assertive? [[9859 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao awkwardly touched her cheek, "Well, I just got my driver's license yesterday, and the excitement hasn't worn off, so I borrowed a car from Dongfang Yang. He has all kinds of sports cars. It's a bit flashy, but it's very comfortable to drive." [[9860 苏桃 neutral]]
"Let's go, I'll take you for a spin." [[9861 苏桃 happy]]
The two of them walked towards the sports car. [[9862 旁白 neutral]]
The surrounding crowd was extremely surprised. [[9863 旁白 neutral]]
"Such a cool sports car. I thought it belonged to some rich young master trying to pick up girls. I never expected it to be two girls." [[9864 陌生男1 neutral]]
A young man showed surprise, then immense envy, "Wouldn't it be amazing to get with a rich girl like that? She's pretty and wealthy." [[9865 陌生男1 neutral]]
The guy next to the young man thoughtfully said, "Actually, it might still be for picking up a girl." [[9866 陌生男2 neutral]]
The young man: "???" [[9867 陌生男1 neutral]]
His buddy said, "Look, both girls are so pretty, and they were holding hands when they came out. The little loli walking behind looks so timid, cute, and obedient." [[9868 陌生男2 neutral]]
"Why can't it be a rich young lady picking up a girl?" [[9869 陌生男2 neutral]]
The young man was dumbfounded when he heard this. [[9870 旁白 neutral]]
"Bro, your perspective is a little too unusual." [[9871 旁白 neutral]]
Although it was unusual, it was partly correct. [[9872 旁白 neutral]]
The relationship between the two in the car had indeed reached an ambiguous stage. [[9873 旁白 neutral]]
One was humbly craving the other's love. [[9874 旁白 sad]]
The other pretended to respond but would occasionally avoid the topic. [[9875 旁白 neutral]]
With the heavy foot of a new driver, the sports car sped off. The cool breeze on her face made Su Tao feel incredibly pleased. [[9876 旁白 happy]]
"Xiaocheng, is the wind too strong? I can put the top back up." [[9877 苏桃 neutral]]
Looking to the side, Su Tao noticed Chi Xiaocheng was looking around again. [[9878 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but feel it was a bit strange. [[9879 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she was looking for someone. [[9880 旁白 neutral]]
She had reacted the same way last time at the cat cafe. [[9881 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was, of course, looking for Dark Xiaocheng. [[9882 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the car started, her danger sense skill gave her a faint warning, but Dark Xiaocheng wasn't there. [[9883 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, over the past half-month, Dark Xiaocheng had appeared many times but had never triggered the danger sense skill. She was always trying to tempt her. [[9884 旁白 neutral]]
But in the end, she was just an illusion. [[9885 旁白 neutral]]
A demon in her heart. [[9886 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't hurt her, so the skill might not have reacted. [[9887 旁白 neutral]]
Now that they were out, she felt a faint reaction again. [[9888 旁白 neutral]]
But it only lasted for a moment. As the car moved, the warning from the skill disappeared again. [[9889 旁白 neutral]]
"That's strange." [[9890 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't think too much about it and belatedly said to Su Tao, "Let's put the top up. It's getting a little chilly." [[9891 池小橙 neutral]]
"Okay." Su Tao nodded, but she couldn't help but worry, "Xiaocheng, if something is wrong, remember to tell me, okay?" [[9892 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay~" [[9893 池小橙 happy]]
Driving around, Su Tao showed off the bold driving style of a new driver, making Chi Xiaocheng feel a bit thrilled and scared. [[9894 旁白 neutral]]
But the thought of Su Tao sitting beside her suddenly made her feel at ease. [[9895 旁白 happy]]
They made an appearance at Dongfang Yang's cafe, then walked a few laps in the park, and when they were tired, they drove to Yangyang Cat Cafe. [[9896 旁白 neutral]]
This was the convenience of having a car; you could go wherever you wanted. [[9897 旁白 happy]]
Just like that, the day passed with laughter and joy. [[9898 旁白 happy]]
In the blink of an eye, evening approached. [[9899 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng arrived at the large shopping mall on Central Street. [[9900 旁白 neutral]]
After a day together, the accumulated anxiety was pushed back down, and Chi Xiaocheng fully enjoyed this date disguised as a shopping trip. [[9901 旁白 happy]]
She was even more certain now. [[9902 旁白 happy]]
Although it was never said out loud. [[9903 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao must like her too. [[9904 旁白 happy]]
Everything that Dark Xiaocheng said was false! [[9905 池小橙 happy]]
Her gloominess dispelled, Chi Xiaocheng was pulled into a boutique by Su Tao. An excited voice brought her back to her senses, "Xiaocheng, this hairpin is perfect for you!" [[9906 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao picked up a small hairpin. [[9907 旁白 neutral]]
It was a hairpin made of a sliced orange and a green leaf. [[9908 旁白 neutral]]
The orange looked like a slice cut right from the middle, with a bit of a cartoonish feel to it. The texture was clear, and the green leaf served as a nice accent to keep the hairpin from being too plain. [[9909 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao half-knelt and gently brushed the hair on Chi Xiaocheng's forehead, "The hairpin is an orange, and Xiaocheng is an orange. It's a perfect match." [[9910 苏桃 happy]]
After putting the hairpin on, Su Tao satisfyingly took out a mirror. [[9911 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng already looked young and cute, and the orange hairpin, like her own personal element, added a touch of liveliness to her. [[9912 旁白 happy]]
"Do you like it, Taotao?" [[9913 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng asked, touching the hairpin. [[9914 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded, "I like it." [[9915 苏桃 happy]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng's eyes crinkled with happiness. [[9916 旁白 happy]]
She assumed Su Tao was talking about her, not just the hairpin. [[9917 旁白 happy]]
Shopping, holding hands, buying gifts, capturing memories with a camera, and exchanging sweet words from time to time—it was all so enjoyable and happy. [[9918 旁白 happy]]
What could this be if not a date? [[9919 池小橙 happy]]
What could this be if not love? [[9920 池小橙 happy]]
At 8 PM, the temperature seemed to drop with the arrival of the night. [[9921 旁白 neutral]]
The two walked to the restrooms on the second floor of the mall. Su Tao handed the things she was carrying to Chi Xiaocheng, "Xiaocheng, hold this for a moment. I'm going to the restroom." [[9922 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay." [[9923 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng held all the items in her arms, waiting with a sweet smile on her face. [[9924 旁白 happy]]
But out of the corner of her eye, she noticed a tall, sturdy man coming out of the men's restroom. [[9925 旁白 neutral]]
He was 1.9 meters tall and very muscular. [[9926 旁白 neutral]]
His gaze... was fixed on her? [[9927 池小橙 sad]]
Instantly, alarm bells went off in Chi Xiaocheng's mind! [[9928 旁白 sad]]
The man seemed to have timed the moment Su Tao was away. Ignoring the crowds and nearby cameras in the mall, he suddenly rushed towards Chi Xiaocheng. [[9929 旁白 angry]]
He opened his arms as if to grab her and run away! [[9930 旁白 angry]]
With the early warning from her danger sense skill, Chi Xiaocheng immediately dropped the things in her hands and cleverly ducked down, covering her head. [[9931 旁白 neutral]]
There was already a huge height difference between them. With her ducking down, the man's grab completely missed. [[9932 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng quickly darted into the women's restroom, shouting, "Taotao, save me!" [[9933 池小橙 sad]]
The man's face turned cold, and he immediately headed into the women's restroom. [[9934 旁白 angry]]
He reached out, trying to grab Chi Xiaocheng again! [[9935 旁白 angry]]
But in that instant, a seemingly delicate arm suddenly shot out from around the corner of the wall, powerfully clamping down on the man's thick arm. [[9936 旁白 neutral]]
A huge force struck him, and the man felt himself being pulled forward! [[9937 旁白 neutral]]
A pull back. [[9938 旁白 neutral]]
A knee strike. [[9939 旁白 neutral]]
Then a flying kick sent the man flying. [[9940 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's movements were extremely clean and decisive, but she frowned as she scanned the area around the women's restroom. [[9941 旁白 angry]]
Several men, dressed in ordinary coats like regular passersby, were surrounding them from all directions. [[9942 旁白 neutral]]
The sudden turn of events interrupted their harmonious date. Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but ask worriedly, "Taotao, what do we do?" [[9943 池小橙 sad]]
Hearing the fearful voice behind her, Su Tao bent down, reached out, and firmly held Chi Xiaocheng's small hand. [[9944 旁白 happy]]
Without looking back, her beautiful figure stood firm as she said in a determined tone, "Don't worry, Xiaocheng. No matter what happens, I will protect you!" [[9945 苏桃 happy]]
