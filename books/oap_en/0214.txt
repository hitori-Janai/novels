Chapter 214: A Growing Sense of Expectation and Unease [[18630 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, my time is limited. I have to go back and continue my work, so you two can take your time and chat." [[18631 程程 neutral]]
After Cheng Cheng stood up, Tang Tang looked at her in surprise. "Are you leaving so soon? You haven't even eaten your hamburger." [[18632 唐糖 neutral]]
Su Tao patiently explained for her, "Cheng Cheng is doing research with her advisor. She only has a few hours off each week. When I message her on WeChat, I sometimes have to wait a long time for her to reply." [[18633 苏桃 neutral]]
"Oh, I see..." [[18634 唐糖 neutral]]
Although Tang Tang was a bit confused, she still waved goodbye to Cheng Cheng. [[18635 旁白 neutral]]
Once she was gone, Tang Tang felt much more relaxed. [[18636 旁白 neutral]]
With Cheng Cheng around, she always felt like she was being watched like prey. [[18637 旁白 neutral]]
Her departure didn't affect their conversation about old times. [[18638 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps it was because Chi Xiaocheng's survival showed Su Tao a brighter future, so she didn't hide much from Tang Tang, only changing some parts of the conversation. [[18639 旁白 neutral]]
She had been critically ill and near death, and only now were there signs of improvement. [[18640 旁白 neutral]]
She could wake up from her deep sleep at any time, which was why Su Tao was so expectant. [[18641 旁白 happy]]
The two of them talked for a long time and then went for a walk. By the time they were about to part ways, it was almost evening. [[18642 旁白 neutral]]
Walking beside Su Tao, Tang Tang sighed with a hint of envy, "It's so nice. You grew up together, relying on each other, and overcame so many difficulties to be together. I'm really envious." [[18643 唐糖 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled shyly. "What's there to be envious about? It should be easy for you to find a good partner, right?" [[18644 苏桃 neutral]]
Tang Tang shrugged. "It's not that simple. In another two years, I'll probably have to enter into an arranged marriage." [[18645 唐糖 sad]]
As she spoke, she kicked a small pebble on the ground. "Let's not talk about that. When your little Cheng wakes up, are you going to confess your feelings right away?" [[18646 唐糖 neutral]]
"Yes!" Su Tao nodded firmly. "After I confess, no matter what happens, I'll love her in my own way." [[18647 苏桃 happy]]
Tang Tang clicked her tongue. "Aren't you going to plan a more ceremonial confession? This is one of the most important moments of your life!" [[18648 唐糖 neutral]]
"Well... I haven't thought about it that much. A confession is what she wants most, and I want to tell her as soon as possible so she understands how I feel." [[18649 苏桃 neutral]]
"Alright then. Remember to introduce me to her later. If you two get married, I'll be your bridesmaid!" [[18650 唐糖 happy]]
"Get out of here! How could we jump to marriage so quickly!" [[18651 苏桃 happy]]
Waving goodbye to Tang Tang, Su Tao put her hands in her coat pockets and looked at the fiery sunset, a smile touching her lips. [[18652 旁白 happy]]
An image from a past dream came to her mind. [[18653 旁白 neutral]]
"When Xiaocheng wakes up and her body has recovered, I'll take her to the amusement park again, and we'll ride the Ferris wheel one more time." [[18654 苏桃 happy]]
The regrets left in dreams should be fulfilled in reality. [[18655 旁白 neutral]]
That eternal confession—she would say it many, many times. [[18656 旁白 happy]]
With a light and expectant heart, Su Tao walked toward Chi Xiaocheng's home, her high ponytail swinging behind her, making her look both cool and beautiful. [[18657 旁白 happy]]
While waiting for the traffic light, during the last few seconds of the red light, a short-haired boy walked up to her, his face red. "E-excuse me, miss. You... you're so beautiful. C-can I have your contact information?" [[18658 陌生男1 neutral]]
The boy was very nervous and didn't even dare to look into Su Tao's beautiful eyes. [[18659 旁白 neutral]]
In the distance, a few others were cheering him on, looking over with anticipation. [[18660 旁白 neutral]]
The shy, short-haired boy had lost at rock-paper-scissors and had to gather all his courage. [[18661 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, Su Tao would have just politely refused, saying she didn't want to be in a relationship. [[18662 旁白 neutral]]
But now... [[18663 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at the changed traffic light and smiled lightly. "Sorry, I have a girlfriend." [[18664 苏桃 neutral]]
With that, she turned and walked away. [[18665 旁白 neutral]]
Her swinging high ponytail was a bit mesmerizing to watch. [[18666 旁白 neutral]]
When she got home, Su Tao received another message from Professor Su. [[18667 旁白 neutral]]
According to the tests, Chi Xiaocheng's body was improving further, although there were still many uncertainties. [[18668 旁白 neutral]]
But if his decades of medical experience and the data from the instruments were correct, she could wake up at any time in the next two to three days. [[18669 旁白 neutral]]
This news was both a shock and a joy to Su Tao. [[18670 旁白 happy]]
She was so happy that she picked up Da Wang and started playing with him, even wanting to take him into the bath with her. [[18671 旁白 happy]]
But for some reason, the cat was terrified of bathing with her and nearly scratched her to escape the bathroom. [[18672 旁白 neutral]]
This made Su Tao a little curious. [[18673 旁白 neutral]]
Even on normal days, Da Wang wasn't that afraid of water. [[18674 旁白 neutral]]
At night, Su Tao looked at the last 500 yuan in her wallet and patiently browsed Taobao. [[18675 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know when Chi Xiaocheng would wake up, but she felt she could prepare a gift in advance. [[18676 旁白 neutral]]
But after looking all night, she couldn't find anything suitable to give to Chi Xiaocheng. [[18677 旁白 sad]]
When it was time to rest, she placed the small straw doll by her pillow and fell asleep hugging the large brown teddy bear. [[18678 旁白 neutral]]
The next morning, Su Tao woke up early. [[18679 旁白 neutral]]
She exercised, ate breakfast, read the news to catch up on things, and then headed to the cafe to work and study. Filled with hope, she seemed more youthful and could smile at everyone she met. [[18680 旁白 happy]]
It was a world of difference from how she was a month ago, right after Chi Xiaocheng had died. [[18681 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng, with a day and a half left until she would wake up, had her consciousness hidden in the straw doll. She was always leaning against Da Wang, watching Su Tao's changes during this time. [[18682 旁白 neutral]]
[Su Tao] [[18683 池小橙 neutral]]
[Height: 166] [[18684 池小橙 neutral]]
[Weight: 95→96] [[18685 池小橙 neutral]]
[Bust: C] [[18686 池小橙 neutral]]
[Current Status: No negative statuses] [[18687 池小橙 neutral]]
[Normal Affection for Host: 99 (She completely sees you as the most important person in her life. She is eagerly awaiting your return)] [[18688 系统 neutral]]
[Romantic Affection for Host: 63→67 (Although the concept of gender still exists for her, she is trying her best to ignore such thoughts. She has realized she likes you, but this affection mostly comes from external pressures rather than her own choice. If an accident happens in the future, this forced affection might decrease)] [[18689 系统 neutral]]
[Possessive Affection for Host: 60→45 (Your death is not certain. As she has calmed down and her rationality has returned, she has realized you will wake up. She is more focused on the future. She subconsciously believes you will like her no matter what, so she feels no need to possess you, since you won't run away. She wants you to have a better life, so she spends more time working hard.)] [[18690 系统 neutral]]
The feedback from the status glasses made Chi Xiaocheng happy, but also a little uneasy. [[18691 旁白 neutral]]
She was happy that Su Tao's weight had increased by one jin. [[18692 旁白 happy]]
The girl who had become gaunt because of her death was now gradually returning to a healthy state. [[18693 旁白 happy]]
But this small happiness couldn't compare to her unease. [[18694 旁白 sad]]
"Her affection level is rising too slowly." [[18695 池小橙 sad]]
"Her possessiveness toward me has also dropped a lot." [[18696 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed sadly as she talked with the System in her mind. [[18697 旁白 sad]]
Tang Tang's appearance had intensified her sense of unease. [[18698 旁白 sad]]
Holding the 4,135 faith points she had accumulated, she kept searching for something in the System's store. [[18699 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, what are you looking for?] [[18700 系统 neutral]]
The System's question made Chi Xiaocheng stop what she was doing. [[18701 旁白 neutral]]
"System, is there anything in the store that can make me temporarily lose my memory?" [[18702 池小橙 neutral]]
