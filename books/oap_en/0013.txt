Chapter 13: Say That Again! [[1079 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, you could win an Oscar for that performance! It was amazing. If I were the female lead, I'd get goosebumps from you staring at me like that. It's so creepy." [[1080 系统 happy]]
"You don't understand. This is a sign that I'm turning into a villain. Only by making Su Tao anxious and keeping her thinking about me can I continuously get Emotion Points from her and proceed with the next step of my plan." [[1081 池小橙 neutral]]
"I can't wait to see you outsmart the female lead! When are we starting? When are we starting!" [[1082 系统 happy]]
"You're just a system. What's the rush?" [[1083 池小橙 neutral]]
"We're the villains here, and a villain has to look the part. If I didn't know your situation, I'd think you were a real yandere." [[1084 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked into the crowd, looking dejected, and the onlookers automatically cleared a path for her. [[1085 旁白 neutral]]
With her head lowered and back hunched, her brown hair hiding her eyes, she looked utterly dejected. [[1086 旁白 neutral]]
But in her mind, she was happily chatting with the System. [[1087 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Chi Xiaocheng realized that her situation at school was a bit strange. [[1088 旁白 neutral]]
Thanks to her delicate and cute face, some strangers and classmates she knew were quite nice to her. [[1089 旁白 neutral]]
But anyone associated with the main characters like Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang treated her terribly. [[1090 旁白 neutral]]
There were also some from high school who never got along with the original owner. [[1091 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Chi Xiaocheng was thinking and walking towards her dorm to rest, she suddenly heard a voice from a quiet path lined with bushes. [[1092 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey, Chi Xiaocheng!" [[1093 陌生女1 angry]]
Hearing the voice, Chi Xiaocheng stopped and slowly turned around. [[1094 旁白 neutral]]
A girl with blonde hair, wearing a crop top and a short skirt, walked over slowly with her hands in her pockets. [[1095 旁白 neutral]]
Behind her was a gloomy-looking follower with black-framed glasses and messy hair, her head lowered. [[1096 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned when she saw her. [[1097 旁白 neutral]]
This was the same blonde girl from the basketball court who had stepped on the water bottle she dropped. [[1098 旁白 neutral]]
She was also a bully who had picked on the original owner in high school. [[1099 旁白 neutral]]
Beating up the original owner used to be a regular thing, and she had continued to bother her often during the first two months of university. [[1100 旁白 neutral]]
Huang Limei gently pushed aside a small bush, slowly walked up to Chi Xiaocheng, and said with an arrogant look, "Well, if it isn't Chi Xiaocheng. Why aren't you wearing your pretty makeup today? Pretending to be innocent and delivering water, who are you trying to seduce?" [[1101 黄莉梅 angry]]
The hostility was obvious, and her classic villain tone made Chi Xiaocheng reflect. [[1102 旁白 neutral]]
She felt that she wasn't much of a villain. [[1103 旁白 neutral]]
This tone and expression, this must be what a real cannon fodder villain is like, right? [[1104 旁白 neutral]]
Glancing at the security camera on the corner of the building, Chi Xiaocheng maintained her act. [[1105 旁白 neutral]]
She shrank back and said cautiously to Huang Limei, "What do you want?" [[1106 池小橙 sad]]
"I don't like you. You got a problem with that?" [[1107 黄莉梅 angry]]
She grabbed the collar of Chi Xiaocheng's sweatshirt and lifted her up with one hand. [[1108 旁白 neutral]]
Her arm, tattooed with a butterfly, had bulging muscles, not at all like a typical girl's. [[1109 旁白 neutral]]
This was Chi Xiaocheng's biggest weakness since she had crossed over. [[1110 旁白 neutral]]
Her body was too weak. [[1111 旁白 neutral]]
She would lose any physical fight, and even with the System, she couldn't change that overnight. [[1112 旁白 neutral]]
Huang Limei threatened Chi Xiaocheng, saying fiercely, "I'm warning you, stay away from Dongfang Yang. That's the man I've got my eyes on!" [[1113 黄莉梅 angry]]
"Pfft." [[1114 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, who had been acting the whole time, couldn't help but let out a laugh. [[1115 旁白 neutral]]
To think it was because of the male lead. [[1116 旁白 neutral]]
In this novel world, these main characters really were the source of all trouble. [[1117 旁白 neutral]]
But in Huang Limei's eyes, Chi Xiaocheng's suppressed laugh was mocking her. [[1118 旁白 neutral]]
Her expression darkened as she stared at Chi Xiaocheng's clean, makeup-free face. [[1119 旁白 neutral]]
"You think it's funny?" [[1120 黄莉梅 angry]]
She raised a hand, her voice turning cold. [[1121 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Chi Xiaocheng dropped the act and said calmly, "Are you sure you want to do this? This is a university, not our old high school. The school won't side with you anymore, even if you have good grades." [[1122 池小橙 neutral]]
At the same time, she quickly searched the System for a way to fight back. [[1123 旁白 neutral]]
She had just reached 200 Emotion Points. She could either spend 150 points on a temporary strength pill. [[1124 旁白 neutral]]
Or spend 10 Emotion Points on a fruit knife and go all out. [[1125 旁白 neutral]]
Or, she could endure it. [[1126 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, the gloomy follower behind Huang Limei said weakly, "There's a camera up there. Maybe we should forget it?" [[1127 陌生女2 sad]]
Huang Limei looked up abruptly, her face growing even uglier. [[1128 旁白 neutral]]
Her raised right hand trembled; she was stuck, not knowing whether to hit her or not. [[1129 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng secretly breathed a sigh of relief. [[1130 旁白 neutral]]
But just then, she spotted a figure walking quickly towards them. [[1131 旁白 neutral]]
An idea popped into her head. [[1132 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at Huang Limei provocatively. "Afraid to hit me? Useless!" [[1133 池小橙 angry]]
"Say that again!" [[1134 黄莉梅 angry]]
The veins on Huang Limei's raised right hand bulged, and she slapped Chi Xiaocheng hard across the face. [[1135 旁白 neutral]]
"Smack—" [[1136 旁白 neutral]]
A crisp sound echoed, and the delicate face quickly turned red. [[1137 旁白 neutral]]
Even though Chi Xiaocheng had a mid-level pain reduction skill, the slap still made her gasp. [[1138 旁白 neutral]]
But... she had achieved her goal. [[1139 旁白 neutral]]
"What are you doing!" [[1140 苏桃 angry]]
A hero arrives. [[1141 旁白 neutral]]
The person who came was Su Tao! [[1142 旁白 neutral]]
She rushed over and saw Chi Xiaocheng, who had just been slapped and was now in tears. "Xiaocheng!" she exclaimed. [[1143 苏桃 sad]]
Huang Limei threw Chi Xiaocheng to the ground and turned with a cold look. "What, Su Tao? You still want to protect this bitch like you did in high school? She's been going against you at every turn!" [[1144 黄莉梅 angry]]
Su Tao's eyes were icy, her pretty face expressionless. "No matter what, Xiaocheng is my sister!" [[1145 苏桃 angry]]
"Such an act! I've been wanting to teach you a lesson for a long time!" [[1146 黄莉梅 angry]]
Huang Limei gathered her strength and threw a heavy punch. [[1147 旁白 neutral]]
However, she didn't expect Su Tao to be a pushover. Su Tao quickly sidestepped the punch and grabbed her right hand. [[1148 旁白 neutral]]
Getting in close, she executed a clean shoulder throw! [[1149 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah!" [[1150 黄莉梅 sad]]
Before the thrown Huang Limei could react, Su Tao pulled her up and kneed her hard in the stomach! [[1151 旁白 neutral]]
Huang Limei coughed up stomach acid, her face twisted in pain. [[1152 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao snorted, grabbed Huang Limei's hair, and walked over to Chi Xiaocheng. "Xiaocheng, how many times did she slap you?" [[1153 苏桃 angry]]
Her commanding eyes softened when she spoke. [[1154 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at her red cheek with a hint of heartache. [[1155 旁白 neutral]]
"O-one slap." [[1156 池小橙 sad]]
"Okay." Su Tao nodded, brushed back her hair, and raised her right hand, slapping it hard across Huang Limei's face. [[1157 旁白 neutral]]
"Smack!" [[1158 旁白 neutral]]
The sound was even louder than Huang Limei's slap had been. [[1159 旁白 neutral]]
A trickle of red blood flowed from the corner of Huang Limei's lips. [[1160 旁白 neutral]]
Her face quickly began to swell. [[1161 旁白 neutral]]
Tossing Huang Limei aside like a piece of trash, Su Tao dusted off her hands. The entire sequence happened in less than a minute, and she moved with such fluid grace. [[1162 旁白 neutral]]
Cool and impressive. [[1163 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was completely stunned. [[1164 旁白 neutral]]
She thought she finally understood why so many people would willingly fall for this "white moonlight" female lead. [[1165 旁白 neutral]]
She had only intended to get slapped to receive some gentle concern from the female lead. [[1166 旁白 neutral]]
She had forgotten that Su Tao's character was actually quite strong. [[1167 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, are you okay?" [[1168 苏桃 sad]]
Even though she still had her doubts, when she helped Chi Xiaocheng up, Su Tao's eyes... [[1169 旁白 neutral]]
...were as gentle as water. [[1170 旁白 neutral]]
