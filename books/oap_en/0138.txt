Chapter 138: The Calm Before the Storm [[12134 旁白 neutral]]
No... that's not right. [[12135 苏桃 neutral]]
Who could stand three more days of this? [[12136 苏桃 neutral]]
Watching Chi Xiaocheng pick out ingredients, Su Tao swallowed nervously and carefully asked, "Xiaocheng, why are you putting things in the fridge in the middle of winter?" [[12137 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned her head in confusion. "Is there a problem with that?" [[12138 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao: "..." [[12139 苏桃 neutral]]
Of course not! [[12140 苏桃 angry]]
Why would anyone eat icy things in the middle of winter! [[12141 苏桃 angry]]
This is completely insane! [[12142 苏桃 angry]]
So, she spoke carefully, "Xiaocheng, maybe we should skip it. Although... it's nice, eating cold things in winter isn't good for you." [[12143 苏桃 neutral]]
"Also, it's too sweet. Eating too much fruit isn't actually good for you. We should just eat a normal... a normal amount. What do you think?" [[12144 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pouted. "Does Taotao not like it?" [[12145 池小橙 sad]]
"It's... it's not that I don't like it, it's just, how do I say it..." [[12146 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao struggled to find the right words, trying to think of a way to not make Chi Xiaocheng go dark. [[12147 旁白 neutral]]
Unexpectedly, Chi Xiaocheng suggested it herself, "If Taotao doesn't like it, you can just say so. Should we try something else?" [[12148 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao's eyes lit up. "Yes, yes, let's try something else." [[12149 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked and pulled out a bottle of liquor. "How about this then? It can warm you up in the winter." [[12150 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao: "..." [[12151 苏桃 neutral]]
Drinking is even worse! [[12152 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao cleared her throat. "Actually, why don't I plan the meals for the next few days? After all, Xiaocheng isn't good at cooking. I'll do it myself to make sure you can enjoy some delicious food." [[12153 苏桃 neutral]]
Yes, as long as I do the cooking, I can avoid what happened last time! [[12154 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled. "Sure, but if it's not delicious, Taotao will have to accept a punishment~" [[12155 池小橙 happy]]
That strange smile once again made Su Tao feel that something was off. [[12156 旁白 neutral]]
She got goosebumps for a moment, but they quickly disappeared as she took a breath. [[12157 旁白 neutral]]
For dinner, Su Tao cooked a combination of steamed ribs, winter melon soup, and green vegetables. [[12158 旁白 neutral]]
And this allowed Su Tao to breathe a sigh of relief. [[12159 旁白 neutral]]
After all, she had cooked it herself, and the taste was excellent. [[12160 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was very well-behaved during the meal, even letting Su Tao feed her at one point. [[12161 旁白 neutral]]
But the more well-behaved she was, the more worried Su Tao felt. [[12162 旁白 neutral]]
After dinner. [[12163 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at her with a smile. "Taotao, do you like me?" [[12164 池小橙 happy]]
"Uh..." Su Tao sat on the sofa, her hands resting uneasily on her lap, trying to caution Chi Xiaocheng. "Xiaocheng, you know I've always liked you, it's just... you don't have to keep asking." [[12165 苏桃 neutral]]
"Mhm, I know." [[12166 池小橙 happy]]
"Good." [[12167 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed and closed her eyes. [[12168 旁白 neutral]]
The pressure from Xiaocheng was still so intense. [[12169 苏桃 neutral]]
But luckily, she was prepared. [[12170 旁白 neutral]]
On the table was a bowl of herbal medicine soup. Just from the smell, you could tell it was incredibly bitter. It was the Chinese medicine Professor Su had prepared to help her recover. [[12171 旁白 neutral]]
She had to drink a bowl every day. [[12172 旁白 neutral]]
The pressure from Chi Xiaocheng was immense. [[12173 旁白 neutral]]
But she could use other ways to ignore that strangeness. [[12174 旁白 neutral]]
This was a form of psychological self-protection that affected her physically. [[12175 旁白 neutral]]
She would rather drink this extremely bitter soup than endure the pressure! [[12176 苏桃 neutral]]
She immediately picked up the bowl of bitter soup from the table and gulped it down. [[12177 旁白 neutral]]
The unpleasant taste was overwhelming. [[12178 旁白 neutral]]
She furrowed her brows in pain, the lingering bitterness on her tongue making her want to desperately gasp for fresh air to get rid of it. [[12179 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng moved closer to her and asked softly, "Is it very bitter?" [[12180 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded without opening her eyes. [[12181 苏桃 neutral]]
"Then..." [[12182 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled, unwrapped a candy, and leaned in. [[12183 池小橙 happy]]
The bitterness faded. [[12184 旁白 neutral]]
Sweetness followed. [[12185 旁白 neutral]]
After a long moment, Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved into a smile. She touched her lips and asked softly, "Is it sweet?" [[12186 池小橙 happy]]
"Sweet." [[12187 苏桃 happy]]
"Then... do you like it?" [[12188 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao was stunned, and her tense body suddenly relaxed. [[12189 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled faintly and nodded. "I like it." [[12190 苏桃 happy]]
This time, it was the truth, not an act. [[12191 旁白 neutral]]
She had indeed become a little obsessed with the taste. [[12192 旁白 neutral]]
Undeniably, it was a great way to relieve stress. [[12193 旁白 neutral]]
Her whole body would soften because of it. [[12194 旁白 neutral]]
Girls are really wonderful. [[12195 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao couldn't help but add in her heart: Xiaocheng, although my love for you is a lie, this one time... [[12196 苏桃 happy]]
...this sweetness of yours... [[12197 苏桃 happy]]
...my fondness for it... [[12198 苏桃 happy]]
...is not a lie. [[12199 苏桃 happy]]
And this girl's way of comforting people is really... [[12200 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao watched Chi Xiaocheng humming and shaking her head, and sighed helplessly. [[12201 旁白 neutral]]
It's hard to put into words. [[12202 旁白 neutral]]
Although today was a bit tense, it was clearly all in her head. Xiaocheng was still quite well-behaved. [[12203 旁白 neutral]]
Uh... yes, well-behaved. [[12204 旁白 neutral]]
Although that word sounded a bit scary now, tonight was the night before the three days officially began, and nothing had happened, right? [[12205 旁白 neutral]]
She was just overthinking it. [[12206 旁白 neutral]]
When she returned to her room at night, Su Tao found that besides the new light-blocking curtains, nothing else had changed. [[12207 旁白 neutral]]
Except that the floor was also covered with a blanket. [[12208 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, Chi Xiaocheng had covered the entire house with blankets. [[12209 旁白 neutral]]
This made Su Tao curious. [[12210 旁白 neutral]]
She looked down, stood on her tiptoes, and pinched the blanket. [[12211 旁白 neutral]]
The texture was very comfortable, and it must have been expensive. [[12212 旁白 neutral]]
Where did the money come from? [[12213 苏桃 neutral]]
Could it be Brother Chi Song? [[12214 苏桃 neutral]]
While Su Tao was guessing, Chi Xiaocheng was already lying in bed, holding up half the covers. "Taotao, come to bed. Are you hugging me tonight, or am I hugging you~" [[12215 池小橙 happy]]
"Is there a difference?" [[12216 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled and slipped into the bed that smelled of Xiaocheng. [[12217 苏桃 happy]]
It was that addictive scent again. [[12218 旁白 happy]]
The sachet smelled just like Xiaocheng. [[12219 旁白 neutral]]
Having gotten used to sleeping with the sachet, Su Tao found it hard to fall asleep without the scent. [[12220 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, habit. [[12221 旁白 neutral]]
It was something that was hard to change once formed. [[12222 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was using various methods to slowly guide Su Tao, making her get used to her, and then unable to leave her. [[12223 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, what's wrong?" [[12224 池小橙 neutral]]
In the bed, feeling the soft body in her arms, Su Tao smiled and replied softly, "Nothing, let's sleep." [[12225 苏桃 happy]]
Tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that—three more days of such warmth. [[12226 苏桃 happy]]
Xiaocheng wouldn't force her to drink those fruit pulps, and said she would switch to a different drink. [[12227 苏桃 happy]]
It seemed like everything was heading in a good direction. [[12228 苏桃 happy]]
At least, that's what Su Tao thought until breakfast the next day. [[12229 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't know. [[12230 旁白 neutral]]
This warmth was just the calm before the storm. [[12231 旁白 neutral]]
