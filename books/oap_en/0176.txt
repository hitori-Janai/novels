Chapter 176: Your Xiaocheng's Death Was So Unworthy [[15331 旁白 sad]]
Her advisor was also injured, but she didn't know which hospital she was in. [[15332 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked down, pursed her lips, and nodded. "I'll head back to the dorm first and grab some things for my advisor." [[15333 苏桃 neutral]]
"That works too." [[15334 程程 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng had no objections and followed Su Tao back to the dormitory. [[15335 旁白 neutral]]
With the holidays approaching, many people were coming and going from the dorm, and most who knew Su Tao greeted her. [[15336 旁白 neutral]]
A small figure sat at the front desk of the dormitory building, busy preparing the departure forms for students to sign. [[15337 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Su Tao's voice, she immediately jumped up and shouted, "Sister Su Tao!" [[15338 方柠 happy]]
The moment Fang Ning's voice rang out, Su Tao froze. [[15339 旁白 neutral]]
The little lolita happily squeezed out of the crowd. "Sister Su Tao, long time no see! Are you free in a bit? I have something I want to talk to you about." [[15340 方柠 happy]]
"Oh... is that so." Su Tao laughed awkwardly, avoiding eye contact. "Sorry, I have to go see my advisor soon, so I don't have much time." [[15341 苏桃 neutral]]
Fang Ning blinked in confusion. "Is it Advisor Qin?" [[15342 方柠 neutral]]
"Yes." [[15343 苏桃 neutral]]
"But isn't Advisor Qin already..." [[15344 方柠 neutral]]
Before Fang Ning could finish, someone from behind her shouted, "Ningning! What should I fill in here? Where are you?" [[15345 陌生人 neutral]]
"Ahhh, I'm here!" [[15346 方柠 neutral]]
Fang Ning put her hands together in apology to Su Tao, then hurriedly squeezed back into the crowd. [[15347 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao tilted her head. Although she was a little confused, she didn't think much of it. [[15348 旁白 neutral]]
Back in the dorm, Chen Qian's bed was tidy and her luggage was packed, but her suitcase was still there, so it seemed she was also preparing to go home. [[15349 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Wei was still fast asleep in her bed. [[15350 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao tiptoed, grabbed her things, and quietly left. [[15351 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng followed beside Su Tao and asked, "What's next?" [[15352 程程 neutral]]
"I'm going to ask which hospital my advisor is in." [[15353 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao returned to the first floor and quickly found a classmate from her major. "Hi, can I ask which hospital Advisor Qin is in now after she was stabbed?" [[15354 苏桃 neutral]]
"Advisor Qin?" The classmate recognized Su Tao and said slowly, "Advisor Qin has already been disciplined and fired. Taozi, you were the one involved, don't you know?" [[15355 同学 neutral]]
"Disciplined? Fired? I was involved?" [[15356 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao was completely baffled. [[15357 旁白 neutral]]
Nearly half a month had passed since Chi Xiaocheng's death. At first, she was completely depressed at home, avoiding Ye Liang while crying with regret. [[15358 旁白 sad]]
After getting revenge on Ye Liang, she lost her purpose and spent her days in a daze at home, not even going to her final exams. [[15359 旁白 sad]]
She had already failed most of her classes this semester and had no idea what had been happening at school. [[15360 旁白 neutral]]
The classmate pointed outside. "Turn right after you leave the dorm area. Everything is written on the bulletin board. Go see for yourself." [[15361 同学 neutral]]
For some reason, Su Tao had a bad feeling. [[15362 旁白 sad]]
Her pace quickened as she walked out of the dormitory. [[15363 旁白 neutral]]
A smile touched Cheng Cheng's lips as she turned back and met the gaze of the small head peering out from behind the counter. [[15364 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning had been watching them ever since Su Tao came down to the first floor. [[15365 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng raised an eyebrow at the little lolita, then gestured in Su Tao's direction. [[15366 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did she start walking, slowly following after her. [[15367 旁白 neutral]]
As for Fang Ning, she blinked a few times in confusion. [[15368 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she saw someone else's shadow in Cheng Cheng's receding figure. [[15369 旁白 neutral]]
After hesitating, she called into the break room, "Auntie Ruanruan, I need to step out for a bit. Can you cover for me?" [[15370 方柠 neutral]]
A kind voice immediately came from the break room, "Of course, little Ningning, you go ahead. If you're busy this afternoon, you don't need to come back. Leave it to me." [[15371 阮阮阿姨 happy]]
"Thank you, Auntie~" [[15372 方柠 happy]]
Fang Ning called out sweetly, ran into the break room to throw on a worn-out second-hand coat, and hurried out to follow Su Tao and Cheng Cheng. [[15373 旁白 neutral]]
The main bulletin board for school affairs was located outside the dormitory area. [[15374 旁白 neutral]]
It was about a five-minute walk away. [[15375 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was looking for her advisor not just out of concern and a desire to apologize, but also to prove to herself that it was Xiaocheng's excessive yandere nature, not her own failure to watch over her. [[15376 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to alleviate the guilt in her heart. [[15377 旁白 neutral]]
--It's really not that I don't love Xiaocheng, but that her yandere nature itself was beyond my control. [[15378 旁白 sad]]
She used this to escape a responsibility that was and wasn't hers. [[15379 旁白 neutral]]
But the closer she got to the bulletin board, the heavier her heart felt for some reason. [[15380 旁白 sad]]
Her sixth sense told her it would be better not to look at it. [[15381 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, she stood before the bulletin board, her eyes quickly scanning for any notice about Advisor Qin. [[15382 旁白 neutral]]
When she saw the large-print notice, Su Tao's pupils shrank. [[15383 旁白 sad]]
"Academic fraud, plagiarism, expelled, and blacklisted from academia..." [[15384 苏桃 sad]]
Her eyes widened, her lips still murmuring the words from the notice. [[15385 旁白 sad]]
"Advisor Qin plagiarized a student, Su Mou's, thesis and published it under her own name to great acclaim..." [[15386 苏桃 sad]]
Then, several thesis titles were listed as examples. [[15387 旁白 neutral]]
How could Su Tao not know? Those were the papers she had worked so hard on for months! [[15388 旁白 angry]]
Cheng Cheng slowly walked over from the side. "So your advisor wasn't mentoring you at all. She was just using you to claim your papers as her own." [[15389 程程 angry]]
"First it was your Sister Long, then your advisor. It's been so long, and Xiaocheng is already dead, yet you're still trying to run away from it all." [[15390 程程 angry]]
"It really wasn't worth it for Xiaocheng." [[15391 程程 sad]]
Listening to the haunting voice in her ear, Su Tao found that Cheng Cheng's usually cheerful, bird-like tone had become oppressive. [[15392 旁白 neutral]]
It was just like... Chi Xiaocheng on the verge of going yandere! [[15393 旁白 sad]]
She spun around abruptly and saw Cheng Cheng's dark eyes seeming to turn red. [[15394 旁白 sad]]
*Thud.* The things she had been holding fell to the ground. [[15395 旁白 neutral]]
A sense of fear she hadn't felt for a long time surged through her. [[15396 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao shivered, then realized Cheng Cheng was just standing there, calmly looking at the bulletin board. [[15397 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't turning yandere like Chi Xiaocheng at all. [[15398 旁白 neutral]]
Was that... an illusion just now? [[15399 旁白 neutral]]
Right, she's Cheng Cheng, not Xiaocheng. [[15400 旁白 neutral]]
Just a new friend from online. At most, they got along well and had a good relationship. How could she turn yandere? [[15401 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't Xiaocheng. [[15402 旁白 neutral]]
But Cheng Cheng's words still struck a chord deep inside Su Tao. [[15403 旁白 neutral]]
"Now, Taozi, do you still think Chi Xiaocheng interfered in your life because she was a yandere?" [[15404 程程 angry]]
"Remember what I said earlier? No matter the outcome, Chi Xiaocheng did those extreme things because she liked you, loved you." [[15405 程程 neutral]]
"Look, your Sister Long and your advisor were both plotting against you in secret." [[15406 程程 neutral]]
"Sun Wukong fought the White Bone Spirit three times to protect Tang Sanzang, but he never earned his trust and was eventually cast out." [[15407 程程 sad]]
"And what about your little yandere knight? Not only did you not understand or trust her, but she died protecting you, and you still refuse to accept her, even in death." [[15408 程程 sad]]
Cheng Cheng glanced at the tree trunk behind Su Tao and smiled. "Your Xiaocheng's death was so unworthy." [[15409 程程 sad]]
And behind that tree trunk, Fang Ning, who was holding a book, felt the light fade from her eyes. [[15410 旁白 sad]]
