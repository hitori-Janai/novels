Chapter 242: Still Not Enough [[20709 旁白 neutral]]
The next day, at the hospital. [[20710 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was watering flowers by the window. Hearing Su Tao's words, she was a little surprised. "Are we going to the banquet too?" [[20711 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yeah, Dongfang Yang said that if you want to go, he'll take us. Just for fun." [[20712 苏桃 neutral]]
"That sounds great! I haven't been out in a long time. As for now..." Chi Xiaocheng stood on her tiptoes. "I'll be fine." [[20713 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao was still a little worried. "But Xiaocheng, is your body really okay? You can only barely walk now, right?" [[20714 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng brushed her hair back with her hand and smiled lightly. "If I really can't walk, you can just carry me." [[20715 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao froze for a moment, as if those words were the most wonderful thing she had ever heard. She smiled and nodded vigorously. [[20716 旁白 happy]]
She was very happy that Chi Xiaocheng could say something like that. [[20717 旁白 happy]]
This is how things should be. [[20718 旁白 happy]]
*When you need me, Xiaocheng, you can rely on me anytime, anywhere.* [[20719 苏桃 happy]]
Because of that sentence, she was happy all day. Even when Fang Ning came again at noon, she didn't act as badly as before. [[20720 旁白 neutral]]
But in her happiness, she forgot something. [[20721 旁白 neutral]]
The matter of whether to awaken Chi Xiaocheng's memories was still undecided. [[20722 旁白 neutral]]
This time, she wasn't avoiding it, just hesitating continuously. [[20723 旁白 neutral]]
Subconsciously, she felt it wasn't time to make a real choice yet. [[20724 旁白 neutral]]
So, there was no rush. [[20725 旁白 neutral]]
*I'll wait a little longer.* [[20726 苏桃 neutral]]
The night before the banquet, Chi Xiaocheng could already walk around the hospital. Her legs were recovering quickly. If she walked continuously, she could last for nearly half an hour. [[20727 旁白 neutral]]
The powerful "Chengzi cells" made Professor Su exclaim every day that it was a miracle in medical history. [[20728 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to study Chi Xiaocheng, but had to suppress the thought. This made the old professor go for a traditional Chinese massage every week to calm his excitement. [[20729 旁白 neutral]]
That same night, after chatting with Su Tao and as she was about to return to her room, Chi Xiaocheng finally had a chance to secretly take out her status glasses and check Su Tao's affection levels. [[20730 旁白 neutral]]
[Su Tao] [[20731 系统 neutral]]
[Height: 166] [[20732 系统 neutral]]
[Weight: 96] [[20733 系统 neutral]]
[Size: C] [[20734 系统 neutral]]
[Current Status: Self-blame, lack of confidence, impatience, excessive hesitation, self-avoidance, mild distraction, mild self-loathing] [[20735 系统 neutral]]
[Normal Affection for Host: 99 (She sees you as the most important person in her life)] [[20736 系统 neutral]]
[Romantic Affection for Host: 67→71 (Although she still has conventional views about gender, her feelings for you are gradually being acknowledged. Missing you for two months has increased her infatuation. Every time she sees you interacting friendly with others, she feels a hint of regret, even a little jealousy. She didn't cherish the opportunity she had before and now deeply regrets it)] [[20737 系统 neutral]]
[Possessive Affection for Host: 45→65 (In a rational state, she can think clearly, but your dislike and distance make her anxious. The 'you' that once belonged only to her no longer does, which is hard for her to accept. The self-imposed pressure is rapidly increasing her possessiveness, but she remains highly rational and knows what she can and cannot do. She is not a paranoid person)] [[20738 系统 neutral]]
The data shown by the status glasses was a bit unexpected for Chi Xiaocheng. [[20739 旁白 neutral]]
She thought the possessiveness would be higher than the romantic affection. [[20740 旁白 neutral]]
Now, it seemed that although it had warmed up past the passing line, it wasn't even at 70 yet. [[20741 旁白 neutral]]
But it made sense. She didn't even dare to confront Fang Ning, so how possessive could she be? [[20742 旁白 neutral]]
Besides... [[20743 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng narrowed her eyes, her gaze fixed on the first sentence of the romantic affection description. [[20744 旁白 neutral]]
—*Still has conventional views about gender.* [[20745 旁白 neutral]]
"Tsk!" [[20746 池小橙 angry]]
"System, do you think there's something wrong with Taotao? With an affection level of 71, she must have strong feelings for me, right? For a regular guy and girl, 80 is enough to confess, but she's still hung up on this!" [[20747 池小橙 angry]]
[Host... after all, she was originally straight. Getting to 71 is already quite good under these circumstances.] [[20748 系统 neutral]]
"She used to be so addicted and forceful when she kissed me, but she still hasn't truly faced her own feelings." [[20749 池小橙 angry]]
She was even planning to give Taotao a little reward after the banquet. [[20750 旁白 neutral]]
With data like this... [[20751 旁白 neutral]]
More pressure! [[20752 池小橙 angry]]
[Right now, Su Tao is probably thinking about how to get your relationship back to normal and make you stop disliking her. The increase in romantic affection is entirely driven by her subconscious.] [[20753 系统 neutral]]
[Perhaps she doesn't even realize how much she likes you. You could really focus on her romantic affection instead of her possessiveness.] [[20754 系统 neutral]]
"No!" Chi Xiaocheng understood what the system meant, but she refused. "The possessive affection must go up, or even if she likes me, I'm afraid something unexpected will happen!" [[20755 池小橙 sad]]
To put it bluntly, she still felt insecure. [[20756 旁白 neutral]]
And she stubbornly believed that only when that value reached her target could she confidently embrace Taotao and enjoy their mutual affection. [[20757 旁白 neutral]]
The system was helpless but had to go along with its host. [[20758 系统 neutral]]
[So, what's next? Are you changing the plan?] [[20759 系统 neutral]]
"Yes, I need to change it a bit. Taotao can't keep hesitating like this. She hasn't even decided whether to awaken my memories yet." [[20760 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought alone in her room, "I need to find another way to provoke her." [[20761 池小橙 neutral]]
[Get Fang Ning to do it?] [[20762 系统 neutral]]
"No, I have other plans for Ningning. Besides, Taotao is too strong. If I have Ningning play the 'rival' to create a sense of crisis, Ningning could be in danger if Taotao acts impulsively." [[20763 池小橙 neutral]]
Yes, Chi Xiaocheng was planning to "create" a love rival for Su Tao. [[20764 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, she wouldn't actually fall for someone else, not even pretend to. [[20765 旁白 neutral]]
But she could have someone else pretend to like her, to put pressure on Su Tao. [[20766 旁白 neutral]]
Previously, when she first met Fang Ning, she had intended this role for the little yandere. Once she had a good relationship with Su Tao, Fang Ning could naturally play the part of a yandere pursuing her. [[20767 旁白 neutral]]
That would give Su Tao the pressure and motivation to act. [[20768 旁白 neutral]]
But plans change, and she had to alter the yandere plan she had for Ningning. [[20769 旁白 neutral]]
So, the role of the fake rival... [[20770 旁白 neutral]]
While Chi Xiaocheng was still thinking, there was a knock on the door. [[20771 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up at the IV drip. It wasn't time to change it yet. [[20772 旁白 neutral]]
"Come in!" [[20773 池小橙 neutral]]
She said loudly, and a 1.9-meter-tall, refined-looking man with glasses walked in. [[20774 旁白 neutral]]
"Good evening." [[20775 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen gently closed the door, his eyes shining with wisdom. [[20776 旁白 neutral]]
He got straight to the point. "Chi Xiaocheng, you were faking it, weren't you? Dr. Lin already told me he noticed your little flaws through his observation." [[20777 司辰 neutral]]
"What a surprise. You even fooled me last time." [[20778 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen took two steps forward, pleased to have exposed Chi Xiaocheng's act. [[20779 旁白 happy]]
To save on Emotion Points, Chi Xiaocheng hadn't used an acting card for ultimate acting when facing Dr. Lin. [[20780 旁白 neutral]]
Conveniently, she also wanted to have a frank talk with Si Chen. [[20781 旁白 neutral]]
The faint smile on her face gradually turned a little sinister. [[20782 旁白 neutral]]
Her red eyes became as eerie as a cat's. [[20783 旁白 neutral]]
From her hospital bed, Chi Xiaocheng looked sweetly at the man before her. "Young Master Si Chen, if I remember correctly, when I was 'dead', you said you wanted to marry Taotao, right?" [[20784 池小橙 angry]]
