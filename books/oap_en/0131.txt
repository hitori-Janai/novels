Chapter 131: Facing Her Own Feelings [[11530 旁白 neutral]]
"Three times, three times!" [[11531 苏教授 angry]]
Professor Su rushed over. After reviewing Chi Xiaocheng's hospitalization records and psychological report, and learning about her suicide attempts, as a doctor, she felt she had to speak her mind. [[11532 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su sat across from Su Tao and glanced at her face. "How are you feeling right now? Can you take in what I'm about to say?" [[11533 苏教授 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao paused for a moment and then nodded quickly. [[11534 旁白 neutral]]
"In that case, I'll be direct." Professor Su was furious. "What kind of guardian are you? In just one month, she's been hospitalized three times for critical conditions and has been near death twice." [[11535 苏教授 angry]]
"That little one was born with a weak constitution and has been malnourished. Don't tell me you didn't know." [[11536 苏教授 angry]]
"I won't even mention the cuts on her arm. I can understand if you didn't know at first, as patients with these kinds of mental health issues often hide their self-harm." [[11537 苏教授 angry]]
"But once you knew, why didn't you stop her? Why didn't you watch over her properly?" [[11538 苏教授 angry]]
"Did you really think she was invincible? Even an iron body couldn't withstand this much!" [[11539 苏教授 angry]]
Professor Su let out a torrent of words. Seeing Su Tao's head bowed low, she finally softened her tone. "If you think my words are too harsh, you can curse me behind my back later. I don't mind." [[11540 苏教授 neutral]]
"But you need to understand, I'm being so harsh to make you take this matter seriously!" [[11541 苏教授 neutral]]
"The little one was lucky this time. But what about next time, and the time after that? You know her mental state is unstable. She could be triggered at any moment and try again." [[11542 苏教授 sad]]
Su Tao bit her lower lip and nodded repeatedly. "I'm sorry, Doctor. There won't be a next time. I'll definitely watch her closely." [[11543 苏桃 sad]]
Professor Su sighed. "Alright, I didn't come here just to scold you. Since I'm taking over as her attending physician, I need to understand her entire situation. I hope you won't hide anything from me." [[11544 苏教授 neutral]]
"Okay, Doctor." [[11545 苏桃 neutral]]
Sensing that the doctor truly cared for Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao talked with her for the whole afternoon, telling her everything in great detail, from Chi Xiaocheng's childhood to her university days. [[11546 旁白 neutral]]
But as she listened, the look in Professor Su's eyes changed. [[11547 旁白 neutral]]
Just like Qian Qing before her. [[11548 旁白 neutral]]
"Wait a moment, you're saying that girl's feelings for you are... romantic love?" [[11549 苏教授 neutral]]
This was different from what Dongfang Yang had said! [[11550 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded lightly. "Two psychologists have analyzed it for me before. My mistaken guidance during her childhood created this situation." [[11551 苏桃 sad]]
"Hmm, this is a bit tricky." Professor Su rubbed her temples. "From what I'm hearing, the main reason for her mental instability is a lack of security. She believes you don't care about her, which leads to suicidal thoughts." [[11552 苏教授 neutral]]
"This is actually quite easy to solve. Just find her a boyfriend." [[11553 苏教授 neutral]]
"But that's assuming your relationship is just sisterly, like that Dongfang Yang boy said." [[11554 苏教授 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lip and gently interrupted, "Doctor, finding... finding a boyfriend for Xiaocheng... that wouldn't work, would it?" [[11555 苏桃 sad]]
Professor Su glanced at Su Tao. "Then do you love her?" [[11556 苏教授 neutral]]
"I... I don't know." [[11557 苏桃 sad]]
Compared to love, the emotion she felt more strongly was fear. [[11558 旁白 neutral]]
Well, it seemed she had to be a counselor before she could be an attending physician. [[11559 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, Professor Su had experience in this area and said directly, "The little one's main problem is a lack of love. It can't be solved just by you promising to watch over her, understand?" [[11560 苏教授 neutral]]
"We're not even talking about a cure, just treating the symptoms." [[11561 苏教授 neutral]]
"If you can't figure out your own feelings and continue to hesitate, it won't have any therapeutic effect on her. It will only hurt her again and again, do you understand?" [[11562 苏教授 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't speak, just buried her head again. [[11563 旁白 neutral]]
The professor continued, "Since you don't love her, what do you do when she confesses to you and says sweet things? Do you lie and say you love her, or do you just avoid it?" [[11564 苏教授 neutral]]
"Instead of doing that, you'd be better off letting her go. Find her a boyfriend, or a girlfriend." [[11565 苏教授 neutral]]
"That Dongfang Yang boy isn't a bad choice. Even if it's just out of pity, he would treat the little one with care." [[11566 苏教授 neutral]]
Hearing that Chi Xiaocheng would be handed over to Dongfang Yang, Su Tao became anxious. "No... no, Xiaocheng can't be with Dongfang Yang." [[11567 苏桃 sad]]
Professor Su shot a look at Su Tao. "Then who do you want to hand her over to?" [[11568 苏教授 neutral]]
"I..." Su Tao hesitated, instinctively wanting to avoid the question again. But when she looked up and met the professor's slightly narrowed eyes, feeling the faint pressure, she followed her heart and said, "I don't want to hand her over to anyone." [[11569 苏桃 sad]]
"Then let's find her other relatives. I remember she has a brother, doesn't she? If the brother can't help, then call her parents." [[11570 苏教授 neutral]]
At this suggestion, Su Tao became even more anxious. [[11571 旁白 neutral]]
"No... no, we can't let Brother Chi Song and her parents come over." [[11572 苏桃 sad]]
She had just promised to take care of Xiaocheng. [[11573 旁白 neutral]]
Both Brother Chi Song and Mother Chi had told her, either in person or on the phone, that since they weren't here, Xiaocheng was in her care. [[11574 旁白 neutral]]
With Chi Xiaocheng in this condition, Su Tao couldn't face the "family" who cared so much for Chi Xiaocheng, and for her. [[11575 旁白 sad]]
Hearing this, Professor Su slammed her hand on the table. "This is not okay! That is not okay! What on earth do you want!" [[11576 苏教授 angry]]
"You can't love her, you don't want others to love her, and you don't think her family should love her!" [[11577 苏教授 angry]]
"Forget Chi Xiaocheng, even that Dongfang Yang boy would be driven to his death by you!" [[11578 苏教授 angry]]
Su Tao shrank back, at a complete loss for words. [[11579 旁白 neutral]]
She was aware of her own contradictions. [[11580 旁白 neutral]]
On one hand, she was afraid of Chi Xiaocheng; on the other, she relied on her. [[11581 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su stood up calmly, her expression returning to normal. "The little one is still weak, but she should be able to talk and eat in a couple of days. I advise you to think carefully in these two days. If she doesn't get the answer she wants..." [[11582 苏教授 neutral]]
"...not cooperating with treatment is the best way to commit suicide." [[11583 苏教授 neutral]]
With those parting words, Professor Su walked towards the door. [[11584 旁白 neutral]]
However, her steps were slow, and as she turned, her lips silently counted down, "3, 2, 1." [[11585 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she reached the door and her count hit 1, Su Tao finally spoke up. "Doctor, then... what if I pretend to love her?" [[11586 苏桃 sad]]
Professor Su turned back, her expression indifferent. "If you are prepared to be discovered at any moment and lose her, then I have no objection." [[11587 苏教授 neutral]]
That short sentence reminded Su Tao of Chi Xiaocheng's question on the Binjiang Bridge. [[11588 旁白 sad]]
--Is your love for me just an act? [[11589 旁白 sad]]
It was also mentioned in the suicide note. [[11590 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao was silent for a long time, her hands trembling under the blanket. "Then Doctor, what... what should I do?" [[11591 苏桃 sad]]
"Force yourself to fall in love with her." [[11592 苏教授 neutral]]
"Is that the only way?" [[11593 苏桃 sad]]
"Sending her to a mental hospital is not a bad alternative." [[11594 苏教授 neutral]]
After saying this, Professor Su left the room without a backward glance, leaving Su Tao alone on the hospital bed, feeling empty. [[11595 旁白 sad]]
Outside the door, Doctor Wang, who had been waiting for a long time, asked, "Professor Su, isn't forcing her to love Chi Xiaocheng a bit too much? Matters of the heart aren't so simple, are they?" [[11596 王医生 neutral]]
Professor Su replied irritably, "I'm just forcing her to face her own feelings." [[11597 苏教授 neutral]]
