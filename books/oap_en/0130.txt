Chapter 130: An Unexpected Awakening [[11447 旁白 neutral]]
When people sense they are about to die, they often feel panic, fear, and a lingering dread, as if looking down from a building dozens of stories high. [[11448 旁白 neutral]]
In the distance is a magnificent view. [[11449 旁白 neutral]]
But if you look down, most people would be startled by the height and imagine what it would be like if they fell. [[11450 旁白 neutral]]
Then, they would instinctively take a step back, their hearts still pounding with fear. [[11451 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had a pain reduction skill. In the past, even when she harmed herself, she could endure the unbearable pain by gritting her teeth. [[11452 旁白 neutral]]
She could even use her intermediate acting skills to fake a sickly appearance. [[11453 旁白 neutral]]
But after truly experiencing death once, a person's mindset changes. [[11454 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought she could get through it like usual and complete her feigned death plan, but as her body grew colder bit by bit, she couldn't help but feel regret and fear. [[11455 旁白 sad]]
Her body temperature dropped, the feeling of weightlessness intensified, and her survival instincts wanted to struggle, but she was too weak to move. [[11456 旁白 sad]]
And so, she felt her life slipping away. [[11457 旁白 sad]]
Even with the scapegoat doll and the System as a safety net. [[11458 旁白 neutral]]
Even though this was part of the plan. [[11459 旁白 neutral]]
In the very end, soaking in the near-freezing water, Chi Xiaocheng was scared. [[11460 旁白 sad]]
She was afraid that if she stayed in a coma for too long, Su Tao would be stolen away by a protagonist like Xiao Ming. [[11461 旁白 sad]]
She was afraid the world's will would completely change Su Tao's storyline while she was gone. [[11462 旁白 sad]]
She was afraid the girl she liked would cry too sadly, and that guilt and regret would overshadow her growing affection. [[11463 旁白 sad]]
Would the sachet she left behind be useful? [[11464 池小橙 neutral]]
Man proposes, God disposes. [[11465 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had made her plan, but she wasn't sure if she could truly guide Su Tao to change in the way she wanted. [[11466 旁白 neutral]]
But after this feigned death, she should treasure me more, right? [[11467 池小橙 neutral]]
She'll definitely regret not accepting my confession, right? [[11468 池小橙 neutral]]
And she'll surely pay attention to me like before, instead of ignoring me just because I'm being obedient, right? [[11469 池小橙 neutral]]
But unfortunately… [[11470 旁白 sad]]
"Did the feigned death plan fail?" [[11471 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng lay on the hospital bed and struggled to open her eyes. Her weak state made it difficult to even think. [[11472 旁白 neutral]]
But when she glanced sideways and saw the girl standing at the door, covering her nose and crying with emotion, she subconsciously opened her mouth and called out, "Taotao..." [[11473 池小橙 neutral]]
Her voice was so hoarse that others couldn't hear it; they could only see her struggling to keep her eyes open, her lips moving slightly. [[11474 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, Su Tao could still make out the shape of her lips. [[11475 旁白 neutral]]
Taotao. [[11476 旁白 neutral]]
The first person on her mind when she woke up was still her. [[11477 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly turned her head and shouted outside, "Dr. Wang, Xiaocheng is awake! Xiaocheng is awake!" [[11478 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked away and gently closed her eyes again. [[11479 旁白 neutral]]
Her consciousness gradually returned, and she asked in her mind, "System, are you still there?" [[11480 池小橙 neutral]]
【I'm here, Host.】 [[11481 系统 neutral]]
The System's voice was still emotionless, but you could clearly sense its relief. [[11482 旁白 neutral]]
"How long was I unconscious?" [[11483 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng continued to ask, "And what's the situation now?" [[11484 池小橙 neutral]]
【Host, you were only unconscious for one night. The feigned death failed and you were revived by the doctors. The scapegoat doll didn't activate.】 [[11485 系统 neutral]]
"So that's how it turned out..." [[11486 池小橙 sad]]
After all, Chi Xiaocheng wasn't a medical student, so she hadn't anticipated this kind of failure. [[11487 旁白 neutral]]
Her knowledge on the subject was limited to the fact that biting your tongue to commit suicide actually means choking on the gush of blood. [[11488 旁白 neutral]]
Not that you would die from the pain or from biting off a piece of your tongue. [[11489 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened her eyes again and glanced at Su Tao, who had returned with the doctor. [[11490 旁白 neutral]]
She thought to herself: Would it be better to pretend I have amnesia? [[11491 池小橙 neutral]]
Unfortunately, she had just called out "Taotao" almost unconsciously. [[11492 旁白 sad]]
As she hid in the bathtub, the endless cold侵ading her body, Chi Xiaocheng could only endure by muttering "Taotao." [[11493 旁白 neutral]]
Facing death is truly not something an ordinary person can do. [[11494 旁白 neutral]]
After Dr. Wang, the attending physician, examined Chi Xiaocheng, he asked softly, "Miss Chi, how are you feeling now? If you can hear me clearly, blink twice." [[11495 王医生 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wanted to answer, but found she couldn't speak. [[11496 旁白 neutral]]
So she obediently blinked twice. [[11497 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Wang held up his hand, showing three fingers. "How many is this?" [[11498 王医生 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked three times again. [[11499 旁白 neutral]]
But even the process of blinking was starting to become difficult. [[11500 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang also rushed over, making a "six" gesture with his thumb and pinky finger, and asked, "Chi Xiaocheng, how many is this?" [[11501 东方阳 neutral]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng managed to roll her eyes with great difficulty before closing them to rest again. [[11502 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang stared blankly at Dr. Wang. "Doctor, is Chi Xiaocheng's condition not very good?" [[11503 东方阳 sad]]
Dr. Wang shot Dongfang Yang a look. "She's telling you not to be an idiot. Young master, you should wait outside." [[11504 王医生 angry]]
Seeing that Chi Xiaocheng still had the energy to joke, everyone relaxed. [[11505 旁白 happy]]
But seeing her lying on the bed, unable to move or speak, her face pale and extremely weak, made Su Tao's heart ache. [[11506 旁白 sad]]
She reached her hands into the blanket and held Chi Xiaocheng's cold hands. [[11507 旁白 sad]]
Regardless of whether Chi Xiaocheng could hear her, she murmured, "Xiaocheng, I'm so sorry. You have to listen to the doctor and keep up with the treatment, okay? When you recover, I'll agree to any condition, any request you have, okay?" [[11508 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao was truly scared. [[11509 旁白 sad]]
Not only was she afraid of Chi Xiaocheng's sick and twisted love. [[11510 旁白 sad]]
She was even more afraid that Chi Xiaocheng would give up on treatment and leave her forever. [[11511 旁白 sad]]
She already had suicidal thoughts, so if she refused treatment now, there would be nothing anyone could do. [[11512 旁白 sad]]
For that reason... [[11513 旁白 neutral]]
A confession is a confession. [[11514 旁白 neutral]]
Agreeing is agreeing. [[11515 旁白 neutral]]
It's better for Xiaocheng to cling to her obediently than for her to send everyone to the other side, like in the dream. [[11516 旁白 sad]]
As if confessing her guilt and regret, Su Tao held Chi Xiaocheng's hand, trying to transfer some warmth to her. [[11517 旁白 sad]]
She didn't notice that Chi Xiaocheng, who had already closed her eyes to rest, had a faint smile on her lips. [[11518 旁白 happy]]
Although the feigned death wasn't successful. [[11519 旁白 neutral]]
But... it wasn't completely meaningless. [[11520 旁白 happy]]
Hey, Taotao. [[11521 池小橙 happy]]
Since you've said that, I really won't let go of your hand. [[11522 池小橙 happy]]
The short morning passed, and Chi Xiaocheng was still resting. [[11523 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had also stayed for a long time. When she got up, she nearly stumbled and fell. The thought that had kept her going was finally let go, and after holding on for so long, she finally collapsed. [[11524 旁白 sad]]
Even with her superhuman constitution, the delayed cold and fever landed her in the hospital room next to Chi Xiaocheng's. [[11525 旁白 sad]]
Considering Chi Xiaocheng's schizophrenia and suicidal tendencies, Dongfang Yang hired a more prominent medical professor to treat her. [[11526 旁白 neutral]]
This professor was not as kind as Dr. Wang. [[11527 旁白 neutral]]
After examining Chi Xiaocheng's condition, he went to Su Tao's room and started scolding her, "I've heard about the situation from the other doctors. You're Miss Chi's older sister, right? How can you be such a guardian?" [[11528 教授 angry]]
