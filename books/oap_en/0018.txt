Chapter 18: To Me, She Is More Important Than You [[1573 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, Ye Liang would have liked it when Su Tao showed such determination and refused him on unreasonable matters. [[1574 旁白 neutral]]
It made him feel how different Su Tao was from other girls. [[1575 旁白 neutral]]
But now! [[1576 旁白 neutral]]
He really disliked that she was talking back to him because of Chi Xiaocheng. [[1577 旁白 angry]]
But because it was Su Tao, whom he liked, he held back his temper. His voice just grew colder, "Su Tao, do you know what you're saying? I invited my parents from the capital for this banquet, and countless family businesses are gathered here. Why do you think I had you dress so formally?" [[1578 叶良 angry]]
"Because I want them to meet you, I want to pave the way for you, to lift you out of your ordinary commoner status so you won't be looked down upon by others because of your background!" [[1579 叶良 angry]]
"Time, energy, connections, money, endless resources... and now you're telling me you're choosing to leave when the event is about to officially start, all because of Chi Xiaocheng?" [[1580 叶良 angry]]
His words grew heavier with each sentence. [[1581 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to see Su Tao back down. [[1582 旁白 neutral]]
However, the scene he imagined did not happen. [[1583 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes were calm, not moved at all by his words. [[1584 旁白 neutral]]
Her tone was very serious, "Ye Liang, I'm grateful for what you've prepared for me, and I know how much you've done. But have you ever thought about whether I actually like these things? I told you a long time ago that I don't care about your money or power. Right now, Xiaocheng is in danger, and I have to go back!" [[1585 苏桃 sad]]
"Heh!" Ye Liang covered his forehead with one hand and laughed. "You know very well I hate that Chi Xiaocheng, and you're still asking me to drive you back?" [[1586 叶良 angry]]
"Heh... hahahahaha!" [[1587 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang burst out laughing, then suddenly moved close to Su Tao again, his presence as imposing as a mountain. "Have you forgotten how Chi Xiaocheng has treated you these past few months!" [[1588 叶良 angry]]
He suppressed his voice, but it was as if he were shouting. [[1589 旁白 neutral]]
"I haven't treated you badly at all these past few months, have I? I gave you everything you wanted and dedicated myself to you wholeheartedly. In your eyes, am I still less important than Chi Xiaocheng!" [[1590 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao met Ye Liang's gaze without a trace of fear. [[1591 旁白 neutral]]
She closed her eyes and took a light breath. [[1592 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed she had made a decision. [[1593 旁白 neutral]]
She took a small step back. [[1594 旁白 neutral]]
Lifting her skirt with one hand and covering the collar of her formal dress with the other, she bowed to Ye Liang. "Ye Liang, I am very grateful for everything you've done for me. I don't know what the future holds, but right now—" [[1595 苏桃 sad]]
She looked up, her beautiful eyes filled with determination. "To me, Xiaocheng is more important than you." [[1596 苏桃 neutral]]
"I'm truly sorry for embarrassing you today. I will formally apologize and compensate you later. I won't trouble you any further." [[1597 苏桃 sad]]
With that, Su Tao turned around without hesitation, her skirt swirling with the lights. [[1598 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone, praying she could still get a taxi in such a heavy storm. [[1599 旁白 neutral]]
But just as she took a step, Ye Liang suddenly grabbed her right hand. [[1600 旁白 neutral]]
She turned her head and saw Ye Liang's gloomy face as he asked, "Why... why is she more important than me in your eyes!" [[1601 叶良 angry]]
She was just a wretched woman. [[1602 旁白 neutral]]
Targeting her, spreading rumors about her, embarrassing her in public, and even instigating others to hurt her, and in the end, even resorting to kidnapping. [[1603 旁白 neutral]]
Anyone would find that unforgivable, right? [[1604 旁白 neutral]]
On what grounds? [[1605 旁白 angry]]
If it were Dongfang Yang or Si Chen, that would be one thing. Even though they were rivals, Ye Liang would admit they were worthy opponents. [[1606 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng, a woman, why did Su Tao care so much about her! [[1607 旁白 angry]]
Ye Liang's eyes widened, staring intently into Su Tao's, trying to figure out what she was thinking. [[1608 旁白 neutral]]
In response to his question, a gentle, nostalgic look appeared in Su Tao's eyes. [[1609 旁白 neutral]]
She said softly, "You've been by my side for a few months, and I'm grateful, but Xiaocheng has been with me for over ten years." [[1610 苏桃 sad]]
She still firmly believed in her heart that Chi Xiaocheng's recent rebellious phase could be corrected. [[1611 旁白 neutral]]
With that said. [[1612 旁白 neutral]]
She shook off Ye Liang's hand. [[1613 旁白 neutral]]
And hurried out of the main hall. [[1614 旁白 neutral]]
She tried calling Chi Xiaocheng's number again, but it still said the phone was turned off. [[1615 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a whistle came from the side. "You're not planning to go back just like this, are you?" [[1616 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao looked over and saw Dongfang Yang approaching, twirling a keychain on his fingertip. "I don't know what happened, but having a car would be much better, right?" [[1617 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips, and her tense, pretty face relaxed a little. "Thank you." [[1618 苏桃 happy]]
"No problem. This banquet is boring anyway. There's an umbrella at the entrance. You can wait for me outside the cruise ship, I'll go to the garage and get the car." [[1619 东方阳 neutral]]
"Okay!" [[1620 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao didn't say much more; Dongfang Yang's help put her at ease. [[1621 旁白 neutral]]
She walked straight out of the hall without a single glance back. [[1622 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't notice that after his anger, Ye Liang stood there as if his soul had left him. [[1623 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, she got into the car in the heavy rain. There was some water on the road, but it didn't affect their driving. [[1624 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang sat in the driver's seat and asked, "Where to?" [[1625 东方阳 neutral]]
"Back to school." [[1626 苏桃 neutral]]
Vroom— [[1627 旁白 neutral]]
The roar of the sports car mixed with the sound of thunder as it sped away. [[1628 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way, what exactly happened? Is Chi Xiaocheng in trouble?" [[1629 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang had a similar thought to Ye Liang at this moment. [[1630 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had done so many terrible things, yet Su Tao still cared about her so much. [[1631 旁白 neutral]]
What could have happened now that made her so anxious she wished she could fly back. [[1632 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sat silently in the passenger seat. [[1633 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't sure if she should tell Dongfang Yang the truth. [[1634 旁白 neutral]]
The story that Chi Xiaocheng had waited for her on the school rooftop in the rain for an hour and might even jump off was too shocking to tell. [[1635 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed so normal at the basketball game this afternoon. Saying she was acting strange might make people think she had a mental illness, right? [[1636 旁白 neutral]]
She hesitated for a moment and asked, "Dongfang Yang, what kind of situation do you think would cause a person's personality to change drastically and become extremely unstable?" [[1637 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at Su Tao. [[1638 旁白 neutral]]
He tactfully didn't ask further, thought for a moment, and replied, "It's probably when they encounter something devastating and unacceptable. It could also be a latent mental illness, or something like a second personality." [[1639 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded upon hearing this. [[1640 旁白 neutral]]
She said no more. [[1641 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone and started contacting people she knew, asking if anyone was still at school and could go to the rooftop to check. [[1642 旁白 neutral]]
She also scrolled through the school's online forums. The fact that there was no news of anyone jumping made her feel a little relieved. [[1643 旁白 neutral]]
With growing anxiety, the car stopped ten minutes later. [[1644 旁白 neutral]]
Horns blared from all around, and the flashing lights of cars filled the windows. [[1645 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang frowned and hit the horn on the steering wheel, saying helplessly, "There's a traffic jam. I don't know what's going on ahead, but a car accident is very likely in a storm like this." [[1646 东方阳 angry]]
The road wasn't flooded, but an accident still happened. [[1647 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's first reaction was to turn around and take another route, but when she looked in the rearview mirror, she saw that the misty rain was also full of car lights behind them. [[1648 旁白 neutral]]
They were completely stuck in the middle of the road. [[1649 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang let out a breath and looked at Su Tao. "Are you in a big hurry?" [[1650 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded seriously. "If I'm late, I'm afraid Xiaocheng will be in danger!" [[1651 苏桃 sad]]
Perhaps, she already was. [[1652 旁白 sad]]
But she didn't dare to think about it. [[1653 旁白 neutral]]
At these words, Dongfang Yang couldn't help but gasp. [[1654 旁白 neutral]]
He glanced sideways at Su Tao. "Can you drive?" [[1655 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment. "I failed my third driving test." [[1656 苏桃 sad]]
"That's enough. As long as you can make it move. With my car and license plate, no one will dare to hit you. You wait here, I'll ride a bike back first." [[1657 东方阳 neutral]]
The situation was urgent, and with Chi Xiaocheng unreachable, this was the only way. [[1658 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao followed his gaze and saw a few shared bikes parked on the roadside. [[1659 旁白 neutral]]
She pursed her lips, opened the passenger door, and got out into the rain. "I'll ride back." [[1660 苏桃 neutral]]
"Are you crazy?! Riding back in a rain this heavy!" [[1661 东方阳 angry]]
Of course, Su Tao wasn't crazy. [[1662 旁白 neutral]]
She understood that if Chi Xiaocheng was still on the rooftop, she would only want to see her. [[1663 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing he couldn't stop Su Tao, Dongfang Yang yelled anxiously, "Hey, there's a raincoat in the trunk!" [[1664 东方阳 angry]]
"No need, wearing a raincoat would waste time." [[1665 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao reached up and pushed her drenched hair aside, her delicate face calm and serious. [[1666 旁白 neutral]]
Scan the code, unlock, and ride the bike. [[1667 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng, you have to be okay! [[1668 苏桃 sad]]
