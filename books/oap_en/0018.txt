第18章 对我来说，她比你更重要
Chapter 18: To Me, She's More Important Than You

如果是平时，苏桃表现出这样的坚毅，并在一些不合理的事情上拒绝自己，叶良会很喜欢。
Normally, Ye Liang would have loved seeing Su Tao show such determination, even when she refused his unreasonable requests.

这样他更能感受到苏桃和其他女生的与众不同。
It made him feel even more strongly how unique she was compared to other girls.

但现在！
But now!

是因为池小橙而顶撞自己，叶良很不喜欢。
She was defying him for Chi Xiaocheng, and Ye Liang did not like that at all.

但因为对象是自己喜欢的苏桃，他还是忍着没有发脾气，只是声音渐寒，"苏桃，你知道你在说什么吗，这次宴会我把父母从京城邀请过来，无数家族企业都聚焦在这里，你以为我让你穿这么郑重是为什么？"
But because it was Su Tao, the girl he liked, he held back his anger. His voice, however, grew cold. "Su Tao, do you have any idea what you're saying? I invited my parents all the way from the capital for this banquet. Countless influential families are gathered here. Why do you think I had you dress so formally?"

"因为我想让他们认识你，我想给你铺路，让你跳出普通的平民身份，再不会因为身份而被别人看不起！"
"It's because I want them to meet you. I want to pave the way for you, to help you rise above your ordinary background so you'll never be looked down on by anyone again!"

"时间、精力、关系、钱，资源数之不尽，可你现在却告诉我，你要因为池小橙，而在活动正式开启的时候，选择离开？"
"Time, energy, connections, money—I've poured in countless resources. And now you're telling me that you're going to leave right as the event is about to begin, all because of Chi Xiaocheng?"

他一句话比一句话重。
Each sentence he spoke was harsher than the last.

想看到苏桃的退却。
He wanted to see her back down.

然而想象中的画面并没有。
But that's not what happened.

苏桃眼神很平静，根本没因为他说的这些话动容。
Su Tao's expression was calm; she was completely unmoved by his words.

语气很是认真，"叶良，我很感谢你为我准备这些，也清楚你的付出，但你有想过我真的喜欢这些吗，很早我就跟你说过，我不在乎你的钱和权，现在小橙有危险，我必须回去！"
Her tone was earnest. "Ye Liang, I'm grateful for everything you've done for me, and I know how much effort you've put in. But have you ever considered if this is what I truly want? I told you a long time ago that I don't care about your money or power. Right now, Xiaocheng is in danger, and I have to go back!"

"呵！"叶良单手捂着额头，笑了，"你明知道我很讨厌池小橙那家伙，还让我开车送你回去？"
"Ha!" Ye Liang laughed, pressing a hand to his forehead. "You know I can't stand Chi Xiaocheng, yet you're asking me to drive you back to her?"

"呵...呵哈哈哈哈哈！"
"Heh... Hahahahaha!"

叶良放声大笑，猛地又贴近苏桃，气势如山般袭去，"池小橙这几个月怎么对你的你难道忘了吗！"
Ye Liang burst into a loud laugh, then suddenly moved closer to Su Tao, his presence as imposing as a mountain. "Have you forgotten how Chi Xiaocheng has treated you these past few months?!"

他压抑着声音，却又像是吼出来。
He kept his voice low, but it felt like a roar.

"我这几个月，没有一点对你不好吧，你想要的我都给你，全心全意地为你付出，难道在你的眼里，我还没有池小橙重要吗！"
"These past few months, I've treated you perfectly, haven't I? I've given you everything you wanted and dedicated myself to you completely. Don't tell me that in your eyes, I'm still less important than Chi Xiaocheng!"

苏桃和叶良对视，没有一丝胆怯。
Su Tao met his gaze without a trace of fear.

闭上眼轻轻呼了一口气后。
She closed her eyes and let out a soft breath.

似乎做出什么决定。
It seemed she had made a decision.

轻轻后退一步。
She took a small step back.

一手提着裙摆，一手捂住胸前礼服的领口，对叶良鞠了一躬，"叶良，我很感谢你对我的付出，未来是怎样的我不清楚，但现在——"
Holding up her dress with one hand and covering the neckline of her gown with the other, she bowed to Ye Liang. "Ye Liang, I am very grateful for everything you've done for me. I don't know what the future holds, but right now—"

她抬起头，瑰丽的双眸坚定无比，"对我来说，小橙比你更重要。"
She lifted her head, her beautiful eyes filled with determination. "To me, Xiaocheng is more important than you."

"今天让你难堪了实在抱歉，之后我会再郑重地道歉和补偿，就不麻烦你了。"
"I'm truly sorry for embarrassing you today. I will formally apologize and make it up to you later. I won't trouble you any further."

说完，苏桃毫不犹豫地转身，裙摆随灯光摇曳旋转。
With that, Su Tao turned without hesitation, her skirt swirling under the lights.

一边拿出手机，祈祷现在这样的暴雨天还能打到车。
She took out her phone, praying she could still get a ride in this downpour.

只是才迈出一步，忽然又被叶良抓住右手。
But she had only taken a single step before Ye Liang grabbed her right hand.

她转头，见叶良阴沉着脸问道，"为什么...为什么在你眼里她比我还要重要！"
She turned to see his face dark with anger. "Why... Why is she more important than me in your eyes?!"

明明只是一个贱女人。
She was just a wretched girl.

针对她、造谣她、让她当众出糗、还教唆别人去伤害她，到最后甚至做出了绑架这样的事情。
She had targeted Su Tao, spread rumors about her, publicly humiliated her, and even encouraged others to hurt her. In the end, she had even resorted to kidnapping.

换做谁都无法原-谅的吧？
Who could possibly forgive something like that?

凭什么？
On what grounds?

如果是东方阳、司辰也就罢了，虽然是对手，叶良也会承认这两人是很优秀的对手。
If it had been Dongfang Yang or Si Chen, he could have accepted it. Though they were his rivals, Ye Liang would admit they were worthy opponents.

可池小橙一个女人，又凭什么让苏桃这么在意！
But Chi Xiaocheng was just a girl. What right did she have to make Su Tao care so much!

叶良睁大双眼，紧紧盯着苏桃的双眸，想看出她到底想的是什么。
Ye Liang's eyes were wide as he stared intently into Su Tao's, trying to understand what she was thinking.

只见问题之下，苏桃双眼多了一抹温柔的追忆。
In response to his question, a gentle, nostalgic look softened her eyes.

淡淡说道，"你在我身边几个月，我很感激，但小橙却陪了我十几年。"
She said softly, "You've been by my side for a few months, and I'm grateful. But Xiaocheng has been with me for over ten years."

她心底依旧坚信，池小橙这段时间的叛逆是可以纠正的。
In her heart, she still believed that Chi Xiaocheng's recent rebellious behavior could be corrected.

说罢。
With that said.

甩开叶良的手。
She shook off Ye Liang's hand.

急匆匆往大厅外走去。
And hurried out of the hall.

再度拨打池小橙的电话，提示的依旧是已关机。
She tried calling Chi Xiaocheng again, but the result was the same: her phone was off.

这时，旁边传来了一个口哨声，"你不会就打算这样直接回去吧？"
Just then, a whistle came from the side. "You're not planning on going back just like that, are you?"

苏桃侧目，见东方阳指尖串着钥匙扣，正一边摇晃钥匙一边走来，"虽然不知道发生了什么，不过有辆车会好很多吧？"
Su Tao glanced over and saw Dongfang Yang approaching, dangling a keychain from his finger. "I don't know what happened, but having a car would be much better, right?"

苏桃抿了抿嘴，紧绷的俏脸放松了一些，"谢谢。"
Su Tao pursed her lips, her tense expression softening slightly. "Thank you."

"没事，反正这宴会也很无聊，门口有伞，你先去游轮外等我吧，我去车库把车开出来。"
"Don't worry about it. This banquet is boring anyway. There are umbrellas by the door. You go wait for me outside the cruise ship, I'll go get the car from the garage."

"好！"
"Okay!"

苏桃也没多言，得到东方阳的帮助让她安心了不少。
Su Tao didn't say much more. Dongfang Yang's help put her much more at ease.

径直走出大厅，连一丝留恋的转身都没有。
She walked straight out of the hall without a single glance back.

她没发现，叶良愤怒过后，却是失了魂一样站在原地。
She didn't notice that after his anger faded, Ye Liang was left standing there as if his soul had left him.

很快，她就着暴雨上了车，路面有些许积水，但并不影响行驶。
Soon, she was in the car, the rain pouring down. The road had some puddles, but it didn't affect their driving.

东方阳坐在主驾驶，问道，"去哪？"
Dongfang Yang sat in the driver's seat and asked, "Where to?"

"回学校。"
"Back to school."

轰隆——
VROOOM—

跑车的轰鸣和雷声掺杂着迅速驶去。
The roar of the sports car mixed with the sound of thunder as they sped off.

"说起来，到底发生了什么事，池小橙出事了？"
"So, what exactly happened? Is Chi Xiaocheng in trouble?"

东方阳此时和叶良差不多的想法。
Dongfang Yang was thinking almost the same thing as Ye Liang.

池小橙都做了那么多过分的事情，苏桃竟然还这么在意她。
After all the terrible things Chi Xiaocheng had done, Su Tao still cared about her so much.

现在出了什么事居然让她着急到恨不得飞回去。
What could have happened to make her so anxious that she wanted to fly back immediately?

苏桃沉默地坐在副驾驶。
Su Tao sat silently in the passenger seat.

不知道要不要和东方阳说实话。
She didn't know if she should tell Dongfang Yang the truth.

池小橙在学校天台等自己淋雨了一个小时，现在还可能跳楼了这种话，实在骇人听闻。
The idea that Chi Xiaocheng had waited for her on the school rooftop, getting soaked in the rain for an hour, and might now have jumped... it was too horrifying to say out loud.

下午球赛看着还那么正常，说她的奇怪恐怕会让人误解为是精神病吧？
She had seemed so normal at the game this afternoon. If Su Tao mentioned how strange she'd been acting, people might think she had a mental illness.

她犹豫了一下，询问道，"东方阳，你说到底是什么情况，才会让一个人性情大变，并且极不稳定呢？"
She hesitated, then asked, "Dongfang Yang, what kind of situation do you think could cause someone's personality to change so drastically and become so unstable?"

东方阳多看了一眼苏桃。
Dongfang Yang gave Su Tao a second look.

识趣地没有多问，思考了一下回答道，"应该是遇到了足以让人崩溃、接受不了的事情吧，也可能是隐性精神病，或者第二人格之类的这种说法。"
He tactfully avoided asking for details and thought for a moment before replying, "It would have to be something devastating, something they couldn't accept. Or maybe a hidden mental illness, or something like a split personality."

苏桃闻言点了点头。
Su Tao nodded at his words.

不再说话。
She fell silent again.

拿出手机一边联系认识的人，看看谁还在学校能不能去天台帮忙看看。
She took out her phone and started contacting people she knew, asking if anyone was still at school and could go check the rooftop for her.

一边刷学校的贴吧论坛，到现在都没有消息传出有人跳楼，让她心安了不少。
At the same time, she scrolled through the school's online forums. There was no news of anyone jumping, which calmed her heart a little.

伴随着内心的焦躁，十分钟后，车停了。
But as her anxiety grew, ten minutes later, the car came to a stop.

鸣笛声自四处响起，车窗外全是闪烁的车灯。
Horns blared from all directions, and flashing car lights filled the view outside the window.

东方阳皱着眉头锤了一下方向盘上的喇叭，无奈道，"堵车了，前面不知道是什么情况，这样的暴雨车祸的可能性很大。"
Dongfang Yang frowned and hit the horn on the steering wheel, sighing in frustration. "There's a traffic jam. I don't know what's going on up ahead, but in a storm like this, an accident is highly likely."

路面没积水，结果还是出了意外。
The road wasn't flooded, but something had still gone wrong.

苏桃第一反应就是掉头抄另一条路，可一看后视镜发现，朦胧的水雾中后面也满是车灯。
Su Tao's first instinct was to turn around and take another route, but when she looked in the rearview mirror, she saw it was also filled with headlights through the hazy mist.

他们被彻底堵死在这路中央了。
They were completely stuck in the middle of the road.

东方阳呼了口气，看向苏桃问道，"很着急吗？"
Dongfang Yang sighed and looked at Su Tao. "Are you in a big hurry?"

苏桃认真点头，"我回去晚了的话，我怕小橙有危险！"
Su Tao nodded earnestly. "If I'm late, I'm afraid Xiaocheng will be in danger!"

或许，现在已经有了。
Perhaps, she already was.

只是她不敢往那方面去想。
She just didn't dare to think about it.

此话一出，东方阳不由倒吸了一口凉气。
Hearing this, Dongfang Yang couldn't help but draw a sharp breath.

他侧目看向苏桃，"会开车吗？"
He glanced at Su Tao. "Can you drive?"

苏桃愣了一下，"我科目三没过。"
Su Tao paused for a moment. "I haven't passed my final driving test yet."

"足够了，能开得动就行，我这车和车牌就没人敢撞你，你在这里等着，我骑自行车先回去。"
"That's good enough. As long as you can move it. With this car and license plate, no one will dare hit you. You wait here, I'll ride a bike back first."

情况紧急，联系不上池小橙这是唯一的办法了。
It was an emergency. Since they couldn't contact Chi Xiaocheng, this was the only way.

苏桃顺着他的视线往外看去，发现路边还停着几辆共享单车。
Su Tao followed his gaze and saw several share-bikes parked on the side of the road.

她抿了抿嘴，打开副驾驶冒雨下车，"我骑车回去吧。"
She pressed her lips together, opened the passenger door, and got out into the rain. "I'll ride the bike back."

"这么大的雨，你骑回去，你疯了吗？！"
"In this downpour? Are you crazy?!"

苏桃当然没疯。
Of course, Su Tao wasn't crazy.

她明白，池小橙如果还在天台，那么她肯定只愿意见到自己。
She understood that if Chi Xiaocheng was still on the rooftop, she would only want to see her.

东方阳见无法阻止苏桃，也是焦急地喊了一声，"喂，后备箱有雨衣！"
Seeing he couldn't stop her, Dongfang Yang shouted anxiously, "Hey, there's a raincoat in the trunk!"

"不用了，穿雨衣浪费时间。"
"No need, wearing it would waste time."

苏桃伸手将额前被打湿的秀发撩拨到一边，清秀的脸蛋冷静而认真。
Su Tao pushed her wet hair away from her forehead, her delicate face calm and serious.

扫码，解锁，骑车。
Scan, unlock, ride.

小橙，你一定不能有事啊！
Xiaocheng, you have to be okay!
