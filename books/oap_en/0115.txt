Chapter 115: Confession [[10113 旁白 neutral]]
The wind howled in her ears, and Su Tao's voice wasn't loud. Much of it was even drowned out by the wind, but Chi Xiaocheng still heard it clearly. [[10114 旁白 neutral]]
When people are on the verge of despair, they reveal their true feelings. [[10115 旁白 neutral]]
If Taotao is saying things like that, does that mean she likes me too? [[10116 池小橙 happy]]
No, she has always liked me. [[10117 池小橙 happy]]
And she often says things like that. [[10118 池小橙 neutral]]
For some reason, even though the situation was extremely critical and their lives depended on luck... [[10119 旁白 neutral]]
...Chi Xiaocheng didn't feel panicked at all. [[10120 旁白 neutral]]
The few sentences echoing in her ears shattered the danger like a bubble. [[10121 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, I'm just a side character whose fate as cannon fodder is hard to change. [[10122 池小橙 sad]]
So, I just need to rely on her completely. [[10123 池小橙 neutral]]
The sports car didn't slow down; instead, it got faster and faster. [[10124 旁白 neutral]]
Before they knew it, they were heading up the arch bridge, less than a hundred meters from the broken section! [[10125 旁白 neutral]]
The pursuers behind them seemed to realize Su Tao's plan, and the gunfire, which had stopped, started up again. [[10126 旁白 neutral]]
Ping-pong sounds hit the trunk of the car. Su Tao's eyes were determined. After glancing at Chi Xiaocheng's fastened seatbelt, she shouted, "Xiaocheng, hold on tight!" [[10127 苏桃 neutral]]
The accelerator. [[10128 旁白 neutral]]
Floored! [[10129 旁白 neutral]]
The roar of the sports car reached its peak. The wind, rain, and fine snow hit their faces, making them sting. Chi Xiaocheng felt like her heart was about to jump out of her chest. [[10130 旁白 neutral]]
70 meters. [[10131 旁白 neutral]]
50 meters. [[10132 旁白 neutral]]
30 meters. [[10133 旁白 neutral]]
The other side of the broken bridge gradually came into view. Several warning signs stood to the side, and in the distance, you could see a police car with its siren on, driving away. [[10134 旁白 neutral]]
With such a long gap, no one knew if the sports car could land safely. [[10135 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe, it wouldn't even fly to the other side of the bridge at all. [[10136 旁白 neutral]]
Some things, if not said now, might never have the chance to be said. [[10137 池小橙 sad]]
"Tao..." [[10138 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had only said one word when a dull "bang" came from behind, causing the whole car to skid from side to side. [[10139 旁白 neutral]]
One of the rear tires had been shot out! [[10140 旁白 neutral]]
But at that moment, the car, with immense power, launched into the air! [[10141 旁白 neutral]]
Reflected in the center of the full moon, Chi Xiaocheng felt as if the whole world had gone quiet. [[10142 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was very nervous, her hands trembling as she gripped the steering wheel. [[10143 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, her gaze remained resolute, as if she had already come to a certain realization. [[10144 旁白 neutral]]
The howling wind and the gunshots from behind all seemed to slow down. [[10145 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned to look at Su Tao. "Taotao!" [[10146 池小橙 neutral]]
She shouted so loudly that Su Tao turned her head to look. [[10147 旁白 neutral]]
The wind had long since blown her hair tie away, and her loose hair danced wildly, making her look incredibly cool and heroic. [[10148 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng let out a soft breath and opened her mouth to say, "Taotao, can you be my girlfriend?" [[10149 池小橙 happy]]
The sports car soared through the air, looking from a distance as if it would disappear into the center of the moon. [[10150 旁白 neutral]]
The loving words of confession were finally spoken. [[10151 旁白 happy]]
But before she could get a response, the car was hit by a violent collision and severe turbulence. [[10152 旁白 neutral]]
The car... made it across! [[10153 旁白 happy]]
The moment it hit the ground, even with her seatbelt on, Chi Xiaocheng felt like she was about to be thrown out! [[10154 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao slammed on the brakes, turning the steering wheel just as quickly. [[10155 旁白 neutral]]
But one of the rear tires had already been shot out before they went airborne. [[10156 旁白 neutral]]
The sports car was like something grabbed and thrown. After reaching the other side of the bridge, it spun two full circles on the road. [[10157 旁白 neutral]]
With a "thud," a huge force hit them. [[10158 旁白 neutral]]
The sports car crashed to a stop against a guardrail, smoke coming from the hood. [[10159 旁白 neutral]]
Besides feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit, Chi Xiaocheng's head also ached dully. [[10160 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly looked over. "Taotao, are you okay?!" [[10161 池小橙 sad]]
"I... I'm okay!" [[10162 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao covered her head with her left hand, feeling a wetness in her palm. Her blurry vision gradually cleared, and she saw Chi Xiaocheng's concerned yet relieved expression. [[10163 旁白 neutral]]
And, of course, the tears that came after surviving a disaster. [[10164 旁白 sad]]
"Did we survive?" [[10165 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao clutched her forehead, which had hit the window and steering wheel. Her heart, which had been calm and prepared, now felt like it was about to jump into her throat. [[10166 旁白 neutral]]
We actually survived! [[10167 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao quickly realized it, opened the car door, and got out. [[10168 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did she notice that the two cars chasing them had also leaped from the bridge, as if trying to fly across just like they did! [[10169 旁白 neutral]]
The feeling of crisis rose in her heart again. [[10170 旁白 neutral]]
But Lady Luck was not on the side of their pursuers. [[10171 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps due to a lack of power, neither car managed to fly over the broken bridge. [[10172 旁白 neutral]]
They hung in the air for a moment, then fell straight into the river. [[10173 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, it's okay now." [[10174 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng also got out of the car, wiped away a tear, and threw herself into Su Tao's arms. [[10175 旁白 happy]]
The alert skill, which had been flashing non-stop, finally went quiet. [[10176 旁白 neutral]]
The sense of crisis in her heart disappeared in an instant. [[10177 旁白 neutral]]
As they hugged, they could clearly feel each other's heartbeats. [[10178 旁白 happy]]
The cold wind blew with fine snow, but it couldn't calm their racing hearts. [[10179 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao reached up, moved her bangs, and covered the bleeding cut on her forehead. [[10180 旁白 neutral]]
Then she gently stroked Chi Xiaocheng's head. "I'm sorry, Xiaocheng. I've given you a bad memory." [[10181 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng shook her head. "You don't have to apologize, Taotao. As long as you're here, tonight is the best memory." [[10182 池小橙 happy]]
Yes, facing hardship together in a moment of crisis, being protected by her, cared for by her—even if the whole world were her enemy, she would still stand by her side. [[10183 旁白 happy]]
How could a memory like that be a nightmare? [[10184 旁白 happy]]
The unease of the past, the tempting words of the dark Xiaocheng, and the anxiety she felt over Su Tao's feelings—all of it was released in this moment. [[10185 旁白 happy]]
On both sides of the bridge, the other black cars that had slowly arrived stopped. Many of them looked at the other side unwillingly, but could only retreat. [[10186 旁白 neutral]]
The moonlight shone down, and it seemed as if the world had become quiet just for the two of them. [[10187 旁白 happy]]
Hugging Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao suddenly remembered something and gently let her go. [[10188 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, wait for me a moment." [[10189 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao turned and went back to the smoking car. [[10190 旁白 neutral]]
After searching for a while, she took out a bouquet of white roses. [[10191 旁白 neutral]]
Because of the constant jostling during the whole trip, the beautiful bouquet looked a bit messy, but that couldn't hide its beauty. [[10192 旁白 neutral]]
Especially under the moonlight. [[10193 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed to sparkle with a bright, clear light. [[10194 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head, confused. "What's this?" [[10195 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao looked apologetic. "Didn't I say before? I wanted to give you a surprise today, but I didn't expect this to happen." [[10196 苏桃 sad]]
"Well, even though this is a bit rushed, and this bouquet is all that's left..." [[10197 苏桃 neutral]]
"I still want to say to you..." [[10198 苏桃 neutral]]
She tilted her head slightly, letting the breeze blow through her messy long hair. A thousand emotions turned into a gentle smile. [[10199 旁白 happy]]
Just then, on the opposite side of the river, a piercing "swoosh—" sound was heard. [[10200 旁白 neutral]]
A spark flew up into the sky. [[10201 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang—" [[10202 旁白 neutral]]
A firework exploded. [[10203 旁白 neutral]]
As if celebrating for the two of them, fireworks danced in the sky one after another. [[10204 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao stared at the fireworks, lost in thought. [[10205 旁白 neutral]]
Then she reached out, holding the white roses in the air, and smiled gently. [[10206 旁白 happy]]
"Xiaocheng, happy birthday." [[10207 苏桃 happy]]
The loud boom of the fireworks exploding in the air struck Chi Xiaocheng's heart. [[10208 旁白 neutral]]
031225. [[10209 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's phone password was the birthday of the original Xiaocheng, and also... her own birthday from her past life. [[10210 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng took the white roses, her vision blurred by tears that flowed down her smiling cheeks and dripped onto the roses. [[10211 池小橙 happy]]
Love, love, love, love, love! [[10212 池小橙 happy]]
It wasn't the madness of a yandere, but her own true feelings. [[10213 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao reached out and gently wiped away Chi Xiaocheng's tears with her thumb. "By the way, what did you want to say in the car, Xiaocheng? The wind was too loud, I didn't hear you clearly." [[10214 苏桃 neutral]]
"It was a confession!" [[10215 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up at Su Tao without any hesitation. "Taotao, will you..." [[10216 池小橙 happy]]
"No, I should say, can I be your girlfriend, and be your one and only?" [[10217 池小橙 happy]]
I love you. [[10218 池小橙 happy]]
In this life, I never want to let go again. [[10219 池小橙 happy]]
