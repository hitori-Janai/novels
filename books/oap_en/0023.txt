Chapter 23: Let the Female Lead Fall in Love with Me [[2017 旁白 neutral]]
    Soon after, Su Tao walked in with the doctor, and Dongfang Yang came along with them. [[2018 旁白 neutral]]
    He wasn't staying up late because he was worried about Chi Xiaocheng, but because he was worried about Su Tao. [[2019 旁白 neutral]]
    Now that he saw Chi Xiaocheng wake up, he could finally persuade Su Tao to get some proper rest. [[2020 旁白 neutral]]
    The doctor stepped forward first, observed Chi Xiaocheng's complexion, then checked some of the instruments connected to her before asking, "How are you feeling physically right now?" [[2021 旁白 neutral]]
    "Not bad." Chi Xiaocheng answered honestly, "My head feels a bit swollen and dizzy, my whole body is weak and powerless, it's even hard to lift my hand, and I'm a little cold, my breathing is warm, no coughing or phlegm." [[2022 池小橙 neutral]]
    The doctor nodded, "You were already physically weak, and now the main problem is your high fever. Apart from that, there are no other serious issues. You need more rest and nutrition. Let's keep you in the hospital for a few days to see how things go." [[2023 旁白 neutral]]
    "Don't stop taking the medicine." After the doctor finished speaking, he remained silent for a while, then glanced at Su Tao and Dongfang Yang, and said hesitantly, "Also, about the injury on your hand... please don't do such things again." [[2024 旁白 neutral]]
    The doctor looked up at the IV drip connected to Chi Xiaocheng, then hurried out to adjust the medication based on her waking condition. [[2025 旁白 neutral]]
    As soon as he left, Su Tao gently sat back down on the small stool beside the bed. [[2026 旁白 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang leaned against the table with a playful expression, "So, tell us, what's really going on with you?" [[2027 东方阳 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng glanced at Dongfang Yang and turned her little head to the side, "I don't want to talk about it." [[2028 池小橙 neutral]]
    "You—" [[2029 东方阳 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang pressed his lips together in a smile, took a deep breath, "You little troublemaker, after causing such a big scene tonight, are you planning to say nothing at all? Su Tao even got a high fever because of you, and Ye Liang probably wants to kill you." [[2030 东方阳 angry]]
    "I'm sorry..." [[2031 池小橙 sad]]
    Chi Xiaocheng hung her head again, looking toward Su Tao, her voice becoming soft and gentle. [[2032 旁白 neutral]]
    This apology was meant for Su Tao. [[2033 旁白 neutral]]
    Her pair of red eyes had lost their usual enchanting quality, with misty moisture making people's hearts soften. [[2034 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao gently took one of Chi Xiaocheng's hands and turned to Dongfang Yang, "Alright, stop talking for now. Let Xiaocheng rest first." [[2035 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang looked at the two of them helplessly and sighed deeply, "Fine, Su Tao, you should hurry up and rest too. Your health isn't much better than this troublemaker Chi Xiaocheng's." [[2036 东方阳 neutral]]
    "Mm-hmm, I'll stay with Xiaocheng a bit longer. Once she falls asleep, I'll go to sleep." [[2037 苏桃 neutral]]
    Her room was right next door, and she knew in her heart that she should comfort Chi Xiaocheng's emotions first. [[2038 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng certainly wanted to sleep too—she was both tired and sleepy—but with Su Tao beside her, she wanted to spend more time looking at this girl who was taking care of her despite having a high fever. [[2039 旁白 neutral]]
    She had some things she wanted to say to Su Tao. [[2040 旁白 neutral]]
    But with Dongfang Yang here, Chi Xiaocheng gave up on that idea. [[2041 旁白 neutral]]
    After the doctor came to change her IV drip, she couldn't hold on any longer and fell asleep as Su Tao gently coaxed her. [[2042 旁白 neutral]]
    After confirming that Chi Xiaocheng was really asleep, Su Tao stood up, gently tucked her little hand under the blanket to cover it, and softly smoothed the messy hair that had fallen across her cheek. [[2043 旁白 neutral]]
    Only then did she quietly leave the room with Dongfang Yang. [[2044 旁白 neutral]]
    Then, covering her head and enduring the weakness and discomfort in her body, she said, "Dongfang Yang, thank you so much for tonight. Without you, I really wouldn't have known what to do." [[2045 苏桃 neutral]]
    Throughout this whole ordeal, he had really helped so much. [[2046 旁白 neutral]]
    Being praised and thanked by Su Tao, Dongfang Yang's lips curved up slightly, and his heart filled with a touch of sweetness, "Since it's something related to you, I can't just sit back and do nothing. You should rest well first. I'll arrange for someone to look after you both." [[2047 东方阳 happy]]
    "Mm, I'll treat you to dinner another day." [[2048 苏桃 neutral]]
    "Okay." [[2049 东方阳 happy]]
    If Su Tao had been sick alone, and Dongfang Yang had been so dedicated in accompanying and caring for her, she might have developed much stronger feelings for Dongfang Yang. [[2050 旁白 neutral]]
    But right now, all her thoughts were focused on Chi Xiaocheng. [[2051 旁白 neutral]]
    Her feelings toward Dongfang Yang were more of gratitude. [[2052 旁白 neutral]]
    With matters of the heart, her mind was too chaotic to think about these things. [[2053 旁白 neutral]]
    Supporting herself against the wall, she walked into her room, but couldn't fall asleep for a long time. [[2054 旁白 neutral]]
    The next morning at 8 AM, Chi Xiaocheng, who had rested for a night, was woken up by a young nurse, who then helped her wash up, change her medication, and eat breakfast. [[2055 旁白 neutral]]
    By the time everything was ready, it was already 9 o'clock, and after eating, her complexion looked much better. [[2056 旁白 neutral]]
    Her energy and spirit were incomparable to last night. [[2057 旁白 neutral]]
    She leaned against the bed, idly playing with her phone, "All things considered, at least during these few days I'm hospitalized, I'll be safe. Ye Liang won't make things difficult for me either, but I need to prepare for after I'm discharged." [[2058 池小橙 neutral]]
    "And with Su Tao, these few days are an important opportunity to build good feelings, so I need to think of a way." [[2059 池小橙 neutral]]
    At this moment, the System in her mind suddenly spoke up. [[2060 旁白 neutral]]
    [Host, I have a plan that can turn this dark situation bright again] [[2061 系统 neutral]]
    [The female lead can't let go of you at all now. Based on the host's actions yesterday, you can completely continue being yandere during these days to deepen Su Tao's impression of you] [[2062 系统 neutral]]
    [You don't even need to build good feelings. With the female lead's personality, the host just needs to show an attitude of "if you don't listen to me, I'll die," and you'll surely be able to control her completely. During this process, you can also do more PUA] [[2063 系统 neutral]]
    [Hehehe...] [[2064 系统 neutral]]
    Listening to the System's words, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but roll her eyes, "How many Soul Hall elders did you eat? Your tone is so arrogant." [[2065 池小橙 neutral]]
    She helplessly explained her thoughts, "Using yandere actions to bind Su Tao now is just a temporary method. As a friend, she definitely won't just sit there and take it, but will try to understand me and correct me. If I keep threatening to die in front of her every day, what will happen when time goes on?" [[2066 池小橙 neutral]]
    "So building good feelings is essential." [[2067 池小橙 neutral]]
    "The first step is to make Su Tao care about me, to put me in a position higher than the protagonists like Dongfang Yang and Ye Liang. This point has shown some effect from the 'death misunderstanding' I deliberately created last night." [[2068 池小橙 neutral]]
    "Once time passes, she'll calm down. What I need to do now is strike while the iron is hot." [[2069 池小橙 neutral]]
    "I need to make her realize that I'm very cute, that I'm her one and only. Only by making her fall in love with me can I truly gain the protection of the female lead's halo." [[2070 池小橙 neutral]]
    [But we're the villain, shouldn't we do more villainous things?] [[2071 系统 neutral]]
    "How vulgar!" Chi Xiaocheng snorted softly, "I never said I was a villain. Although my plan is a bit extreme, my starting point is fine. Look at Su Tao's mid-to-late story arc." [[2072 池小橙 neutral]]
    "She gets killed by a heaven-sent supporting female character, betrayed by the male lead, her relatives and friends die, and finally ends up dying from self-harm." [[2073 池小橙 neutral]]
    "I'm not doing this for selfish desires, but to save her, so I have no choice but to take this extreme route!" [[2074 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng spoke with great righteousness. [[2075 旁白 neutral]]
    What yandere evil little loli? [[2076 池小橙 neutral]]
    Please, my moral compass is super straight, okay! [[2077 池小橙 neutral]]
    Just as she was getting excited talking with the System, Chi Xiaocheng's phone suddenly vibrated. [[2078 旁白 neutral]]
    It was actually a message from Chen Qian to her alternate account. [[2079 旁白 neutral]]
    "What exactly did you do to Su Tao? She actually sent me a message early this morning asking such strange questions?" [[2080 陈倩 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow, showing a pleased expression. [[2081 旁白 happy]]
    It had only been two days since she had won over Chen Qian and placed her beside Su Tao, but the effect was already showing. [[2082 旁白 neutral]]
    Perfect timing—she could start the next step of her plan! [[2083 旁白 neutral]]
