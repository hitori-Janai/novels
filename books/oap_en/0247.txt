Chapter 247: Congratulations, You've Provoked Two Yanderes [[21083 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Tang Tang's serious words, Su Tao suddenly grew cautious. "Tang Tang, didn't you say you were straight? That you were definitely into guys." [[21084 苏桃 neutral]]
Tang Tang giggled, "Look how nervous you are. Xiaocheng is so cute, I wouldn't mind switching for her. You wouldn't understand this love-at-first-sight impulse since you're always with her." [[21085 唐糖 happy]]
Hearing her words, Su Tao was speechless for a moment. [[21086 旁白 neutral]]
She actually understood what Tang Tang meant. [[21087 旁白 neutral]]
Back in middle and high school, they couldn't afford nice clothes. Just getting enough nutritious food was a struggle. So no matter how pretty Chi Xiaocheng was, her charm was hidden away. [[21088 旁白 neutral]]
Now in college, she can work part-time to earn money. And with Dongfang Yang as a tool... I mean, as a good person, she eats, drinks, and dresses well, so her charm can no longer be contained. [[21089 旁白 neutral]]
However, Su Tao still didn't like this. [[21090 旁白 neutral]]
It felt like something that belonged to her was slowly being taken away by someone else. [[21091 旁白 sad]]
"By the way, Taozi, why are you dressed like that? Why not wear something nicer and be a matching pair with Xiaocheng?" [[21092 唐糖 neutral]]
Tang Tang's question brought Su Tao back to reality. Her outfit wasn't bad, but it was too modest compared to all the dresses at the party. [[21093 旁白 neutral]]
She gave a dry laugh. "Xiaocheng and I aren't there yet. Like I said last time, there hasn't even been a confession. Before, she had something like a split personality, and now she has amnesia after waking up from a serious illness." [[21094 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao bit her lip. "Her memory hasn't returned, and our relationship has faded a lot. Right now... we aren't as close as we were before." [[21095 苏桃 sad]]
"That's even more reason to get together! You're not taking advantage of a great opportunity like amnesia? Hurry up and make Xiaocheng yours. Are you going to wait for someone else to move in?" [[21096 唐糖 happy]]
"Ugh, it's just really complicated. Tang Tang, if you don't know the whole story, please don't rush me like this." [[21097 苏桃 sad]]
Tang Tang said helplessly, "It's not me rushing you. If you don't make a move, other people will." [[21098 唐糖 neutral]]
Following her friend's gaze, Su Tao noticed that a handsome man in a pure white tuxedo was already walking towards Chi Xiaocheng. [[21099 旁白 neutral]]
He held a white rose and seemed to be deliberately drawing everyone's attention, raising his voice a bit. "Miss Xiaocheng, my surname is Du. I am the third young master of the Du family. This white rose is for you. May I get to know you?" [[21100 杜三少爷 neutral]]
Tang Tang's loud gasp had already let many guests know what to call Chi Xiaocheng. [[21101 旁白 neutral]]
—Xiaocheng. [[21102 旁白 neutral]]
A cute name, fitting for the small and cute girl she was now. [[21103 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the young master of the Du family approach with a white rose, Su Tao couldn't sit still anymore. She stood up and clenched her fists. [[21104 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng carefully noticed Su Tao's movement. [[21105 旁白 neutral]]
Intermediate Acting, activate! [[21106 系统 neutral]]
Already quiet and gentle, her face now showed a hint of awkwardness, as if she wasn't used to being approached like this. And the person in front of her was a "handsome guy." As a normal girl, she was a bit "flustered." [[21107 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't blush, but she didn't know where to put her hands, and she didn't dare to make eye contact with the young master of the Du family. [[21108 旁白 neutral]]
Taotao, this is the amnesiac Xiaocheng right now. [[21109 池小橙 happy]]
If you don't pay more attention to me, someone else will really snatch me away~ [[21110 池小橙 happy]]
As expected, after she put on such an act, Su Tao couldn't stop herself from walking over. [[21111 旁白 neutral]]
And she didn't reach out to take the white rose. [[21112 旁白 neutral]]
She was just waiting for Su Tao to come over and knock that white rose away. [[21113 旁白 neutral]]
However, this also sent a signal to the young master of the Du family. [[21114 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't refuse, she was just shy. Doesn't that mean he has a chance? [[21115 旁白 neutral]]
He intensified his verbal attack, not noticing Su Tao approaching. Just as he was about to go all in and force the rose into Chi Xiaocheng's arms, a sharp, piercing voice came from a distance. [[21116 旁白 neutral]]
"Third Young Master Du, you're in high spirits. You dare to make a move on this girl? And the rest of you, acting like you've never seen the world." [[21117 林芳雅 angry]]
A slender woman in a flamboyant red dress slowly walked in from the back door. [[21118 旁白 neutral]]
She held a red fan, and her gaze on Chi Xiaocheng was full of scorn. "Perhaps no one here knows, but Ye Liang died because of this little girl!" [[21119 林芳雅 angry]]
As soon as she said this, the entire place fell silent. Even Su Tao, who was halfway there, froze. [[21120 旁白 neutral]]
The topic of Ye Liang had been labeled "sensitive" all over Jiuzhou City. [[21121 旁白 neutral]]
Although the Ye family's branch in Jiuzhou City had fallen and been carved up, a starved camel is still bigger than a horse. Besides, the second young master of the Ye family had already taken over here. [[21122 旁白 neutral]]
If what this woman said was true... [[21123 旁白 neutral]]
The young master of the Du family immediately pulled back the white rose he had extended. At the same time, he took a step back, frowning at the woman who had just arrived. "I remember you. You're the one nobody in the Lin family wants, right? What proof do you have for saying that!" [[21124 杜三少爷 angry]]
The woman continued to walk forward gracefully, causing many people in the audience to frown. [[21125 旁白 neutral]]
Among them were Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, and Su Tao. [[21126 旁白 neutral]]
Because they knew this woman and had been searching for her for a long time. [[21127 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya! [[21128 旁白 angry]]
The woman who disappeared with Xiao Ming after Ye Liang's death! [[21129 旁白 neutral]]
She was definitely involved in hiring a sniper to assassinate Chi Xiaocheng, which almost succeeded by a strange twist of fate! [[21130 旁白 neutral]]
The person they couldn't find anywhere had now shown up on her own, and was targeting Chi Xiaocheng with such hostility. [[21131 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen and Dongfang Yang glanced at each other, both nodding slightly at that moment. [[21132 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen began to walk out from the crowd, slowly making his way towards Chi Xiaocheng. [[21133 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Dongfang Yang headed towards the main entrance. [[21134 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya had already reached the center of the main hall. She stared straight at Chi Xiaocheng and sneered, "You all might think I'm joking, but as a member of the Lin family, I have no reason to falsely accuse someone who is being coddled by Young Master Si and Young Master Dongfang, right? I'm only saying this because it's the truth." [[21135 林芳雅 angry]]
Lin Fangya let out a cold laugh. "You might be wondering how this little girl could have killed Ye Liang. In fact, she didn't kill him. Ye Liang had a conflict with her, and after her brother found out, he brought a large group of people back from Lizhi City and forcibly killed Ye Liang!" [[21136 林芳雅 angry]]
"You all have your own sources. You should know why Jiuzhou City is in such chaos, right?" [[21137 林芳雅 angry]]
As Lin Fangya spoke, she suddenly extended her hand, pointing her index finger straight at Chi Xiaocheng, and then abruptly shifted it to Su Tao. "If you don't know that girl, what about her? Everyone must know Su Tao!" [[21138 林芳雅 angry]]
"A woman who is cheap to the bone. She was seducing Ye Liang before, making a huge scene. After Ye Liang died, she started seducing Young Master Dongfang and Young Master Si. But how can she handle two young masters by herself?" [[21139 林芳雅 angry]]
"So she brought out her little sister, the one sitting over there pretending to be an innocent little rabbit!" [[21140 林芳雅 angry]]
"One big slut, and one little slut!" [[21141 林芳雅 angry]]
"For those of you who like these two, what kind of taste do you have?" [[21142 林芳雅 angry]]
In a way, the fireworks had already started before the banquet even began. [[21143 旁白 neutral]]
The smell of gunpowder became extremely thick. [[21144 旁白 neutral]]
The expressions on Chi Xiaocheng's and Su Tao's faces turned grim at the same instant. [[21145 旁白 sad]]
