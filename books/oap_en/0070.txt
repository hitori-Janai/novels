Chapter 70 Cooked Rice [[6113 旁白 neutral]]
The playful voice message was released, and Su Tao felt as if she had been electrocuted. [[6114 旁白 neutral]]
An indescribable tingling sensation spread throughout her body. [[6115 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian, who was beside her, naturally heard the message as well. [[6116 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes, full of meaning, assisted, "Oh, a date~ Look how sincere Xiaocheng's invitation is. The soft and sweet anticipation is overflowing. Then look at Ye Liang, he only tells you to go to his company." [[6117 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled bitterly and shook her head, typing a reply, "Sorry, I have classes all day today. Xiaocheng also has to go to class, right? Skipping classes every day is not good." [[6118 苏桃 neutral]]
She tried to change the subject. [[6119 旁白 neutral]]
However, the next voice message that came was a mournful sound of disappointment. [[6120 旁白 neutral]]
"So that's it. So Tao Tao doesn't like going on dates with me." [[6121 池小橙 sad]]
Pressure +10. [[6122 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao gasped. [[6123 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly replied, "No... I mean, besides classes and homework, sometimes teachers also look for me, right? How about Saturday? Saturday we can... we can go on a date all day!" [[6124 苏桃 neutral]]
Before long, Su Tao heard Chi Xiaocheng's surprised reply, "Really?! I love Tao Tao the most!" [[6125 池小橙 happy]]
Her arm dropped, and Su Tao suddenly put down her phone, sighing, "My heart is so tired, my head hurts so much. It feels like I'm coaxing a child." [[6126 苏桃 sad]]
Chen Qian said lightly, "But I thought you slept well last night?" [[6127 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment. [[6128 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, even though she felt tired when she woke up, it was because the accumulated fatigue from the past few days hadn't dissipated yet. [[6129 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't had such a good night's sleep in half a month. [[6130 旁白 neutral]]
"Perhaps... it's the psychological effect of this sachet?" [[6131 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao reached out and touched the sachet tied to her waist, which was covered with cartoon orange patterns. [[6132 旁白 neutral]]
The scent was very fragrant and a little familiar, refreshing. [[6133 旁白 neutral]]
Saturday. [[6134 旁白 neutral]]
Date. [[6135 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed again, "Forget it, it's not a date anyway. Let's just treat it as ordinary shopping." [[6136 苏桃 neutral]]
"Tsk, I think you don't know what's good for you." [[6137 陈倩 neutral]]
Chen Qian replied, then stood up to leave, "I'm going to get breakfast. What do you want me to bring?" [[6138 陈倩 neutral]]
The roommate who was sleeping suddenly stretched out a hand, "Anything, but not too greasy, and no rice noodles. Anything else is fine~" [[6139 舍友 neutral]]
Chen Qian rolled her eyes at her roommate, then looked at Su Tao, "What about you?" [[6140 陈倩 neutral]]
"I'll listen to you." [[6141 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao gave her a grateful look. [[6142 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "Then I'll bring you some steamed buns." [[6143 陈倩 neutral]]
"Wait!" Su Tao quickly covered her mouth, looking as if she wanted to vomit but couldn't, "No steamed buns, anything else is fine!" [[6144 苏桃 sad]]
In the dark room, what she ate the most were steamed buns, but the taste was the worst! [[6145 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, after receiving the signal for a Saturday date, excitedly got out of bed. [[6146 旁白 neutral]]
She opened the door and went out, but strangely smelled a strong fragrance. [[6147 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother?" [[6148 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng came to the living room and found her brother wearing an apron, struggling to carry the cooked millet porridge to the table with one arm. [[6149 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song heard the sound and turned around. Seeing the confused and cute Chi Xiaocheng, he was first stunned, then slightly timidly loosened his neck and shoulders. [[6150 旁白 neutral]]
His scarred, fierce face showed a hint of awkwardness, "Little sister, long time no see." [[6151 池松 neutral]]
Although he had a fierce face, his expression at this moment was like a child who had done something wrong and was at a loss. [[6152 旁白 neutral]]
Even before she transmigrated, the original owner and her brother hadn't seen each other for three years. [[6153 旁白 neutral]]
This villainous brother couldn't relax in front of his sister! [[6154 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng put her hands on her hips, looking very cool, and said with a slight seriousness, "Close your eyes." [[6155 池小橙 neutral]]
"Ah? Oh." [[6156 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song didn't understand, but he still made a military stance. [[6157 旁白 neutral]]
Then Chi Xiaocheng brought a small stool and placed it in front of Chi Song. [[6158 旁白 neutral]]
Standing on the stool, she was still a head taller than her 1.8-meter tall brother. [[6159 旁白 neutral]]
Then she reached out her small hand and gently touched his head. [[6160 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother, welcome home." [[6161 池小橙 neutral]]
Gentle movements, reassuring and dependent tone. Chi Xiaocheng could easily do all of these with her intermediate acting skills. [[6162 旁白 neutral]]
Logically, it should be the sister being patted on the head by the brother. [[6163 旁白 neutral]]
But sorry, only Tao Tao can touch my head. [[6164 旁白 neutral]]
Just a short sentence, but it broke through the barrier in Chi Song's heart. [[6165 旁白 neutral]]
His tense body suddenly relaxed, and the big boy showed a foolish smile, his expression filled with happiness, "Mm, brother is back." [[6166 池松 happy]]
After breakfast, Chi Xiaocheng chatted with her brother. [[6167 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song wasn't very good at communicating. Most of the time, Chi Xiaocheng was talking, and he was listening. No matter what the topic was, his eyes were always on that small figure. [[6168 旁白 neutral]]
In the original novel, at this point in time, the original owner had already been beaten to the brink of death and was about to be drowned. [[6169 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Song, as her biological brother, would receive this death message on New Year's Eve. [[6170 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, he had become one of the four hall masters of the Fierce Dragon Gang, truly becoming Brother Long's confidant. [[6171 旁白 neutral]]
Although he wasn't a public figure, he was considered successful in his career. [[6172 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't returned for three years. He took a long-awaited leave for the New Year, only to receive the news of his sister's death. [[6173 旁白 neutral]]
After blackening, something unexpected happened to the Fierce Dragon Gang, and the brother was forced to become the new leader of the Fierce Dragon Gang. [[6174 旁白 neutral]]
Then, he led the remaining forces of Brother Long and frantically pursued Ye Liang, fighting from Lizhi City to Jiuzhou City. In the end, as a villainous male supporting character, he still couldn't defeat one of the male leads with a halo. [[6175 旁白 neutral]]
This time, calling her brother back early also disrupted the original plot of the book. [[6176 旁白 neutral]]
The butterfly's wings flapped faster and faster, also causing a hint of anxiety in Chi Xiaocheng's heart. [[6177 旁白 neutral]]
During their casual chat, they again discussed Ye Liang's information. [[6178 旁白 neutral]]
After listening, Chi Song slammed his fist on the table, "Damn Ye Liang, he's simply too much! Not only does he want to snatch my designated sister-in-law, but he also wants to hurt you!" [[6179 池松 angry]]
"Xiaocheng, you just sit here. Brother will go and blow him up!" [[6180 池松 angry]]
"Hey, wait, wait!" Chi Xiaocheng quickly pulled back the irrational Chi Song, "He's a young master, and he has countless bodyguards with halos. Brother, you just need to protect me and Tao Tao a little. Don't be so impulsive!" [[6181 池小橙 neutral]]
"But this isn't a solution either!" Chi Song sat down again, scratching his hair, "How about you, little sister, and Xiao Tao come with me to Lizhi City? We'll have a wedding banquet tomorrow, and after the wedding night, Ye Liang should give up." [[6182 池松 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Chi Song's anxious expression and couldn't help but retort, "Brother, Tao Tao doesn't necessarily like me." [[6183 池小橙 neutral]]
"Oh, what do you know!" Chi Song lectured, "Even if Xiao Tao doesn't agree, just tie her up and throw her on the bed, and then the rice will be cooked. Will Xiao Tao's personality allow her to ignore you?" [[6184 池松 neutral]]
"In three to five days, Xiao Tao will self-strategize and accept this matter with comfort. After that, you just keep pestering her, and won't you easily win her over?" [[6185 池松 neutral]]
"Brother knows you too well." Chi Song earnestly advised, "Listen to brother, we'll leave for Lizhi City tomorrow." [[6186 池松 neutral]]
If it were that simple, why would she have to rack her brains to play a yandere and formulate a yandere plan?! [[6187 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng directly rejected Chi Song's proposal. [[6188 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song spread his hands like a bear, "Then what should we do?" [[6189 池松 neutral]]
"Anyway, brother, just listen to me. I have a plan. The main thing now is to make Tao Tao fall in love with me. You just need to put some pressure on her through WeChat when you're free." [[6190 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Song: "Okay, I'll listen to you!" [[6191 池松 neutral]]
He had no other skills besides fighting. He was just obedient. [[6192 旁白 neutral]]
Whatever big brother said, he would do. Wherever big brother pointed, he would fight. [[6193 旁白 neutral]]
What's more, this was his little sister. Chi Song would listen to anything she said. [[6194 旁白 neutral]]
Time flew by, and soon it was the weekend. [[6195 旁白 neutral]]
Early in the morning, Chi Xiaocheng changed into a cute outfit. [[6196 旁白 neutral]]
Tao Tao. [[6197 旁白 neutral]]
Date time. [[6198 旁白 neutral]]
