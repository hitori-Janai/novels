Chapter 99: A Yandere Without Knowing It [[8572 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't worry." Dr. Lin poured a glass of water for Su Tao. "This diagnosis isn't as bad as we thought." [[8573 林医生 neutral]]
Su Tao let out a breath. "That's good. I lost my composure." [[8574 苏桃 neutral]]
Sitting in a chair, Su Tao calmed herself down. [[8575 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Lin glanced at Si Chen, nodded, and said, "Let's discuss this one step at a time. First, regarding the yandere aspect." [[8576 林医生 neutral]]
Her tone grew serious. "There's no doubt Miss Chi is a yandere. Miss Su, you shouldn't hold on to any wishful thinking." [[8577 林医生 neutral]]
Si Chen, standing to the side, asked, "Did you test her?" [[8578 司辰 neutral]]
"Yes," Dr. Lin nodded. "I mentioned that you, Young Master, still liked Miss Su, and she immediately got agitated." [[8579 林医生 neutral]]
Si Chen: "..." [[8580 司辰 neutral]]
He gave Dr. Lin a speechless look, with a hint of resentment. "I have never, ever liked Su Tao, alright?" [[8581 司辰 angry]]
Su Tao looked at Dr. Lin hopefully. "So, if we go with treatment, what are the chances?" [[8582 苏桃 happy]]
Dr. Lin tapped her index finger on the table and said slowly, "I can't make any guarantees. It depends on your determination." [[8583 林医生 neutral]]
Su Tao asked, puzzled, "Determination?" [[8584 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Lin nodded. "The truth is, you've been avoiding this fact. If you really want to cure her yandere tendencies, you must be prepared to give up all your other relationships for her sake alone." [[8585 林医生 neutral]]
"This..." [[8586 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's expression was troubled. [[8587 旁白 sad]]
Leaning against the wall, Si Chen said in a deep voice, "A person who can't give up anything can't achieve anything." [[8588 司辰 neutral]]
He felt this deeply. [[8589 旁白 neutral]]
To return to his former position in the Si family and wash away the humiliation, he would give up anything! [[8590 旁白 angry]]
Dr. Lin tried to ease Su Tao's stress with a gentle smile. "Don't worry too much. That's a last resort for extreme situations." [[8591 林医生 neutral]]
"So that means there are other ways?" [[8592 苏桃 happy]]
"Of course." [[8593 林医生 happy]]
Su Tao began to feel hopeful. [[8594 旁白 happy]]
However, what Dr. Lin said next quickly dashed her hopes. [[8595 旁白 sad]]
Because what she said was basically the same as what Dr. Cheng had said. [[8596 旁白 neutral]]
Stabilize her emotions, don't provoke her, try to go along with her, and then slowly try to change her. [[8597 旁白 neutral]]
But there were some slight differences. [[8598 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Lin smiled faintly. "When you're sure she's being very obedient and won't resist you at all, you can be a bit more firm and take the lead." [[8599 林医生 neutral]]
"Firm?" [[8600 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes," Dr. Lin said. "Let Miss Chi get used to or even fear your firmness. Then, if something extreme happens in the future, she'll be more likely to listen to your opinion." [[8601 林医生 neutral]]
"Okay, I understand." [[8602 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed internally. [[8603 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Lin wasn't a psychologist who specialized in yandere, after all. After meeting in person, her methods and conclusions were similar to Dr. Cheng's. [[8604 旁白 sad]]
Dr. Cheng had only listened to her description of the situation and had helped her multiple times over the past half-month. [[8605 旁白 neutral]]
Even the slight recovery during Xiaocheng's treatment was thanks to Dr. Cheng's methods. [[8606 旁白 neutral]]
With this comparison, Su Tao's opinion of Dr. Cheng grew even higher. [[8607 旁白 neutral]]
She would never have guessed that Dr. Lin and Si Chen were both on "Team Cheng." [[8608 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, what they said was biased toward Chi Xiaocheng. Dr. Lin was also a psychologist, so the lies mixed into her words were even harder to distinguish. [[8609 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up and asked, "What about the split personality?" [[8610 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Lin's voice became a bit low. "I couldn't be too absolute in front of Dr. Chen and Young Master Dongfang, but I can confirm this: she has mild split personality. Yes!" [[8611 林医生 neutral]]
As soon as she said this, Su Tao's expression became solemn. [[8612 旁白 sad]]
Si Chen, however, looked as if he had expected it. "With both a yandere side and a normal side, it's not unusual to have a mild split personality." [[8613 司辰 neutral]]
He even felt he had vaguely figured out Chi Xiaocheng's "activation code." [[8614 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lowered her head. "It's all my fault." [[8615 苏桃 sad]]
If she had gone to find Xiaocheng right after their argument during the summer vacation, none of this would have happened. [[8616 旁白 sad]]
Dr. Lin: "For now, let's try medication for a while. Try to provoke her as little as possible. The more she's provoked, the deeper her yandere tendencies might become." [[8617 林医生 neutral]]
"Okay, thank you, Dr. Lin." [[8618 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao stood up and bowed, then looked at Si Chen. "Thank you too, Si Chen. I'm so sorry for always troubling you." [[8619 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen gave a bright smile. "It's nothing. We're friends, after all." [[8620 司辰 happy]]
Of course, they were only friends on the surface. [[8621 旁白 neutral]]
After carving the words "Never Love Tao" on himself, Si Chen could no longer turn back. [[8622 旁白 neutral]]
After seeing Su Tao off, Si Chen lit a cigarette. [[8623 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at Dr. Lin again. "Tell me about Chi Xiaocheng's report." [[8624 司辰 neutral]]
Dr. Lin nodded. "Of course, Young Master. My personal diagnosis is a mild split personality, and also..." [[8625 林医生 neutral]]
"Wait a minute," Si Chen interrupted her. "Su Tao is gone. It's just the two of us, so there's no need for the lies. We were only lying to Su Tao because we're on Chi Xiaocheng's side." [[8626 司辰 neutral]]
However, Dr. Lin's serious expression didn't change. "I wasn't lying to Miss Su about the split personality. Miss Chi does have mild symptoms, and I believe Dr. Chen's theory is correct." [[8627 林医生 neutral]]
"What theory?" [[8628 司辰 neutral]]
"The three-personality hypothesis." [[8629 林医生 neutral]]
Dr. Lin added, "Of course, I only said three personalities so they could understand. In reality, it's three conflicting psychologies and behaviors." [[8630 林医生 neutral]]
"The reason I publicly denied Dr. Chen's hypothesis was because Miss Su and Young Master Dongfang were there, and I needed to hide Miss Chi's situation." [[8631 林医生 neutral]]
"But his hypothesis is highly accurate. I sensed it when I was talking with Miss Chi." [[8632 林医生 neutral]]
Si Chen's expression slowly turned serious. "So, you're saying that besides her yandere side and her normal side, Chi Xiaocheng has another side?" [[8633 司辰 neutral]]
"Most likely, yes." [[8634 林医生 neutral]]
"But that doesn't make sense!" Si Chen rubbed his brow. "Becoming a yandere due to unrequited love, being different from her normal self, I can understand that. Her upbringing could certainly lead to such an extreme personality." [[8635 司辰 neutral]]
"But where did this extra side come from?" [[8636 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen had investigated Chi Xiaocheng's background; she came from a very ordinary farming family. [[8637 旁白 neutral]]
But she knew about Su Tao's 'God of War' father, which was a major contradiction for Si Chen. [[8638 旁白 neutral]]
Could there be another mystery to her identity? [[8639 旁白 neutral]]
The normal Xiaocheng she pretends to be. [[8640 旁白 neutral]]
The uncontrollable, extreme yandere Xiaocheng. [[8641 旁白 neutral]]
A yandere without knowing it. [[8642 旁白 neutral]]
So, what kind of Xiaocheng is caught between the normal act and the yandere? [[8643 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen couldn't figure it out, and he had no answers. [[8644 旁白 sad]]
But this time, the diagnosis was unexpected for everyone. [[8645 旁白 neutral]]
And the subject of the diagnosis, Chi Xiaocheng herself, was facing another problem. [[8646 旁白 neutral]]
At home that night, Chi Song had returned from Dongfang Yang's and had dealt with the aftermath of the Ye Liang incident. [[8647 旁白 neutral]]
To this day, Ye Liang hadn't woken up in the hospital. The revenge that the Ye family should have fiercely launched was blocked by Dongfang Yang. [[8648 旁白 neutral]]
He took Chi Song with him to apologize, and it's unclear what was promised, but to stop the Ye family from pursuing the matter, the ten million that Ye Liang had mentioned was unavoidable! [[8649 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's move from the capital to Jiuzhou City was essentially a form of neglect from his family. [[8650 旁白 neutral]]
Whether he lived or died didn't matter much, but the Ye family's pride couldn't be tarnished. [[8651 旁白 neutral]]
This ten million wasn't for Ye Liang's medical expenses. [[8652 旁白 neutral]]
It was to save the pride of the Ye family in the capital. [[8653 旁白 neutral]]
But here was the problem: where would the ten million come from? [[8654 旁白 sad]]
