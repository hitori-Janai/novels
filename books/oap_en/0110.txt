Chapter 110: The Accumulating Unease [[9589 旁白 neutral]]
For the next few days, Chi Xiaocheng lived a very routine life. [[9590 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song left, leaving her with two thousand yuan for living expenses. [[9591 旁白 neutral]]
She would spend some time at Dongfang Yang's cafe during the day, stare blankly in her room after returning in the afternoon, and Su Tao would come over to have dinner with her on time in the evening. [[9592 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't want to overplay the yandere persona, so she used the excuse of being "busy recently" to reduce her conversations with Su Tao as Dr. Cheng. [[9593 旁白 neutral]]
She no longer actively interfered in Su Tao's life. [[9594 旁白 neutral]]
She no longer forced her to make any particular choice. [[9595 旁白 neutral]]
The occasional information she learned came from the traitor, Chen Qian. [[9596 旁白 neutral]]
The dark Chi Xiaocheng, whether an illusion or real, would only occasionally appear in her formal dress in the dead of night. [[9597 旁白 neutral]]
Not speaking, not forcing, not tempting. [[9598 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she was adding a touch of warmth to the empty, cold house. [[9599 旁白 neutral]]
And it was also as if she was constantly reminding her that Su Tao was drifting further and further away. [[9600 旁白 sad]]
This dull routine continued for about half a month, and with various high expenses being unavoidable even without going out, Chi Xiaocheng, who was struggling financially, started using her hacking skills to earn money. [[9601 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, with only a standard set of hacking tools, she didn't do anything illegal, just strengthened firewalls for some companies, enterprises, or small workshops; or if someone was doxxed, she would provide counter-protection. [[9602 旁白 neutral]]
She took on some smaller jobs online. [[9603 旁白 neutral]]
In a week, she could make several hundred to a thousand yuan. [[9604 旁白 neutral]]
It was enough to be self-sufficient even if she ordered takeout every day. [[9605 旁白 neutral]]
December 20th. [[9606 旁白 neutral]]
The temperature was close to freezing, and amidst the heavy snowfall, the windows began to carve scratch after scratch on the ice. [[9607 旁白 neutral]]
Due to the heavy snow, there were occasional news reports of traffic accidents and gas explosions on TV. [[9608 旁白 neutral]]
Her phone rang, and Chi Xiaocheng, holding Dawang, received another message from Chen Qian. [[9609 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh my god, that woman with the surname Lin came to find Su Tao again. This time, it's said that even the dean of students had to get involved!" [[9610 陈倩 angry]]
"If it weren't for Dongfang Yang backing Su Tao from the school's side, the dean probably wouldn't have helped her. The two almost got into a physical fight this morning." [[9611 陈倩 angry]]
Seeing the message, Chi Xiaocheng quickly typed a reply, "Is Taotao hurt?" [[9612 池小橙 sad]]
Chen Qian: "Not really, but that Lin woman was being very aggressive. Seeing her felt like seeing my old self, so disgusting." [[9613 陈倩 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng breathed a sigh of relief, a strange glint flashed in her eyes, but she quickly suppressed it. [[9614 旁白 neutral]]
Familiar with the early development of the original novel, she knew who this person surnamed Lin was. [[9615 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya, the unfavored daughter of a middle-class family in Jiuzhou City. [[9616 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike Chi Xiaocheng, who, even as a villain, had an inseparable and complicated role with Su Tao in the original novel. [[9617 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya was a pure cannon fodder villain who appeared just to be put in her place. [[9618 旁白 neutral]]
Aggressive at first, then she'd pull some tricks, only to be狠狠 slapped down by the female lead, Su Tao. [[9619 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya was not favored at home and had a low status. After meeting Ye Liang at a banquet, she had long wanted to use the president's influence to climb up. [[9620 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, Ye Liang wouldn't be interested in her pursuit. In the original novel, she attacked Su Tao out of jealousy. [[9621 旁白 neutral]]
This time, with Ye Liang hospitalized, Lin Fangya logically became hostile towards Su Tao, starting to target her and make small moves in their daily lives. [[9622 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the world of a female-centric novel. As the main female lead, Su Tao's path is not meant to be smooth. Beside her, the dark Chi Xiaocheng in her elegant formal dress appeared again and asked curiously, 'This Lin Fangya dares to target your Su Tao like this, aren't you going to go and get rid of her?'" [[9623 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
In the past, Chi Xiaocheng would have definitely gotten angry. [[9624 旁白 neutral]]
In order to play the yandere, she had to engrave the idea of "Taotao is mine" in her mind to show her possessive and pathological nature, forcing Su Tao to focus her attention and thoughts on her. [[9625 旁白 neutral]]
But now, Chi Xiaocheng was unmoved by the dark figure's temptation, "Taotao didn't tell me about this. She must not want me to worry or get involved." [[9626 池小橙 neutral]]
"This side character can't hurt Taotao." [[9627 池小橙 neutral]]
This was the key point. [[9628 旁白 neutral]]
After all, she was just a cannon fodder waiting to be put in her place, not even surviving 50 chapters in the original novel. [[9629 旁白 neutral]]
"Interfering on my own would make her worry and she wouldn't like it." [[9630 池小橙 neutral]]
The dark Chi Xiaocheng chuckled softly and didn't push any further. [[9631 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she took a deep look at the door that Chi Xiaocheng hadn't left much in the past ten days. [[9632 旁白 neutral]]
"You think you can keep someone by staying in this house and pretending to be obedient?" [[9633 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"What if one day, bad news comes knocking at the door? What will you do then?" [[9634 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"A mask is just a mask, after all!" [[9635 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
At night, Su Tao came home as promised. [[9636 旁白 neutral]]
But what was different from usual was that she was clutching her arm as if she was injured. [[9637 旁白 neutral]]
Her face was contorted in pain. After opening the door, she closed it with her back and asked, "Xiaocheng, can you get me the disinfectant and gauze?" [[9638 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng froze for a moment, a sense of unease rising in her heart. [[9639 旁白 neutral]]
She rushed to get the first-aid kit, "Taotao, did something happen?" [[9640 池小橙 sad]]
"Who bullied you!" [[9641 池小橙 angry]]
The latter sentence carried an uncontrollable hint of anger in her voice. [[9642 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was taken aback and gave a forced, helpless smile, "The elevator was at the top floor and it would take too long to come down. I wanted to see Xiaocheng quickly, so I took the stairs but wasn't paying attention and fell." [[9643 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao opened the first-aid kit and skillfully disinfected and bandaged the wound with Chi Xiaocheng's help. [[9644 旁白 neutral]]
But no matter how Chi Xiaocheng looked at it, it didn't seem like a fall. [[9645 旁白 neutral]]
If she fell, why weren't Taotao's clothes dirty? [[9646 旁白 neutral]]
She was curious, so she asked, "This doesn't look like a fall, does it? Taotao, you can tell me anything." [[9647 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao smiled and shook her head, "Don't worry, I'm fine. This small wound on my arm won't leave a scar, it'll heal in a while." [[9648 苏桃 happy]]
"Okay then." [[9649 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's mood dropped a little. [[9650 旁白 neutral]]
The dark Chi Xiaocheng appeared again, squatting next to her, looking at Su Tao's arm. [[9651 旁白 neutral]]
Without even listening, Chi Xiaocheng knew what this person wanted to say, nothing more than "she's hiding it from you." [[9652 旁白 neutral]]
She still chose to believe Su Tao. [[9653 旁白 neutral]]
Since Su Tao didn't want to talk about it, she wouldn't press her. [[9654 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao also quickly changed the subject, no longer dwelling on the wound, and instead said, "Xiaocheng, are you free this weekend?" [[9655 苏桃 happy]]
"The weekend?" [[9656 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yeah, December 25th. I borrowed a car from Dongfang Yang. After I get my driver's license on the 24th, how about we go for a drive? I have a surprise for you too." [[9657 苏桃 happy]]
"A surprise?" Chi Xiaocheng was a little excited, "What kind of surprise?" [[9658 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao spread her hands, "It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you. Anyway, it's something I've prepared carefully." [[9659 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng brought her face close to Su Tao's, looking expectant, "Is it a reward for being good recently?" [[9660 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao was taken aback again. [[9661 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled gracefully, "I guess you could say that." [[9662 苏桃 happy]]
Suddenly, a certain belief in her heart once again suppressed the unease. [[9663 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked smugly at the dark Chi Xiaocheng beside her, as if to say: See, Taotao still cares about me. [[9664 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng was in a very happy mood and slowly asked Su Tao, "So Taotao, are you sleeping here tonight?" [[9665 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao looked away, "Sorry Xiaocheng, I have something else to do today." [[9666 苏桃 sad]]
