Chapter 213: Tang Tang, Do You Like Su Tao? [[18557 旁白 neutral]]
Soon after, Su Tao and Cheng Cheng left the house again and followed a BMW to the community entrance. [[18558 旁白 neutral]]
The driver, who was a bit short but unusually pretty, brushed her bangs aside. "Sorry for the delay, get in!" [[18559 唐糖 neutral]]
Her voice sounded a little young, like a child whose voice was still changing, but it was clearly a girl's voice. [[18560 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pulled Cheng Cheng into the back seat and made introductions. "This is Cheng Cheng, another friend of mine." [[18561 苏桃 neutral]]
"And this is Tang Tang, my junior high classmate and the second daughter of the Tang Group in our Jiuzhou City." [[18562 苏桃 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng fastened her seatbelt and looked at Tang Tang with confusion. "The second daughter?" [[18563 程程 neutral]]
Tang Tang laughed. "That's an exaggeration. My dad just owns a decent company. Miss Cheng Cheng, it's nice to meet you." [[18564 唐糖 happy]]
Since she was driving, she didn't extend a hand to shake. [[18565 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Cheng Cheng still looking at her strangely, she seemed to realize something and laughed again. "Ah, you misunderstood because of my appearance, right? I just look like a tomboy. I actually prefer a cooler, more stylish look." [[18566 唐糖 happy]]
"After all, I'm not as pretty as Su Tao. If I had her looks and figure, I'd show them off too." [[18567 唐糖 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao glanced at Tang Tang. "You two can chat, but please leave me out of it. I rarely pay attention to things like looks..." [[18568 苏桃 neutral]]
As she spoke, she subconsciously touched the high ponytail she was wearing today and adjusted the collar of her brown coat. [[18569 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao's small movements in the rearview mirror, Tang Tang clicked her tongue twice. "Tsk tsk, on a scale of 10, that face is a solid 9.7. Slim waist, long legs, and a great chest. If you were just 5 centimeters taller to reach 1.7 meters, I can't imagine how many boys would fall for you." [[18570 唐糖 happy]]
"Not to mention your great personality. Although my impression of you is still from junior high, after not seeing you for a few years, you've become someone I look up to." [[18571 唐糖 neutral]]
Listening to her teasing, Su Tao's face grew more embarrassed, and she grabbed a cushion and lightly hit her on the head. "Oh, stop it! Don't talk about things like that!" [[18572 苏桃 sad]]
"Hahahahaha!" [[18573 唐糖 happy]]
Cheng Cheng watched the friendly banter between the two. [[18574 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't notice that Cheng Cheng, who was usually quite talkative, was now rather quiet. [[18575 旁白 neutral]]
She just narrowed her eyes, her gaze shifting between the two of them. [[18576 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the three of them discussed where to go for lunch. [[18577 旁白 neutral]]
After talking for a while, Tang Tang made the decision: it was Su Tao's treat at KFC. [[18578 旁白 neutral]]
They found a small corner, and the three of them sat down and started chatting. [[18579 旁白 neutral]]
It was mostly Su Tao and Tang Tang who did the talking. They had been separated since junior high graduation and met again three years later in university. [[18580 旁白 neutral]]
Neither of them was the shy type who couldn't speak up, so the two talkative girls had a lively conversation. [[18581 旁白 neutral]]
The fries were poured onto a napkin on the tray, followed by a packet of ketchup. [[18582 旁白 neutral]]
After Su Tao dipped a fry and ate it, Tang Tang took a fry and dipped it into the same bit of ketchup. [[18583 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even open a new packet for herself. [[18584 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng, noticing these details, quietly pulled Su Tao aside and whispered in her ear, "You're being a little too close with this Tang Tang. If your little Cheng knew, she would get jealous, right?" [[18585 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment and explained, "We're just friends, and besides, we're both girls. But thank you for the reminder, Cheng Cheng. I'll keep my distance from other guys." [[18586 苏桃 neutral]]
Even without her saying, Su Tao was already deliberately keeping a distance from Dongfang Yang and Si Chen. [[18587 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao didn't realize that a yandere could get jealous of girls too. [[18588 旁白 neutral]]
It's not that she couldn't have friends, but that was on the condition of giving her partner enough sense of security. [[18589 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, it was a lack of perspective, because Xiaocheng wasn't here, was she? [[18590 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, Cheng Cheng joined the conversation and started to have a simple dialogue with Tang Tang. [[18591 旁白 neutral]]
"Tang Tang, what kind of person do you think Taozi is?" [[18592 程程 neutral]]
"I think she's unique and perfect. She was already outstanding in junior high, and many classmates liked and admired her." [[18593 唐糖 neutral]]
"Then since you admire a girl like Taozi, who is so perfect, do you like her?" [[18594 程程 neutral]]
"Hahaha, it depends on what kind of 'like' you mean. For a girl like Su Tao, even without thinking about romance, who wouldn't like her?" [[18595 唐糖 happy]]
"Do you ever feel the urge to pursue her?" [[18596 程程 neutral]]
"That would only happen if Su Tao were interested in me. Honestly, if I were a guy, I would pursue Su Tao without hesitation." [[18597 唐糖 neutral]]
"That's a bit of a rude answer, you know. Taozi already has a partner." [[18598 程程 neutral]]
"Huh, really? Su Tao, you're already in a relationship? Quick, tell me who was able to win your heart!" [[18599 唐糖 happy]]
Facing Tang Tang's relentless questions, Su Tao helplessly covered her forehead. [[18600 旁白 neutral]]
This was also why she always saw a reflection of Chi Xiaocheng in Cheng Cheng. [[18601 旁白 neutral]]
This upperclassman, two years her senior, would also get fixated on strange details and ask questions relentlessly. [[18602 旁白 neutral]]
Then she would just enjoy the show, a smile on her face, waiting to see the other person's reaction. [[18603 旁白 neutral]]
Just like how she had thrown the questions Su Tao had been avoiding right in her face. [[18604 旁白 neutral]]
But it was because of this that she was able to face her feelings for Xiaocheng. [[18605 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what happened, someone who just blindly protected you couldn't be called a true friend. [[18606 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes, a person only wakes up after being called out. [[18607 旁白 neutral]]
At this point, Tang Tang was looking at Su Tao with a pleading expression. "Su Tao, just tell me! Who is your partner? How are things now? Why didn't you bring them to hang out? I really want to meet them!" [[18608 唐糖 happy]]
Su Tao gently pushed away her approaching head and said with a soft laugh, "It's not accurate to say we're partners." [[18609 苏桃 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng glanced over. "Not partners?" [[18610 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao touched her cheek with her index finger. "I haven't officially confessed to her, so I don't know if she considers us a couple in her heart." [[18611 苏桃 neutral]]
But beside them, Tang Tang was about to scream. "You're the one confessing to him? Which bastard is it that made even you fall in love!" [[18612 唐糖 angry]]
Her words drew the attention of many other customers. [[18613 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled awkwardly. "It's not a man." [[18614 苏桃 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[18615 唐糖 neutral]]
Tang Tang blinked blankly. [[18616 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao said, "You know the person I like. It's that little one who was always with me back in junior high." [[18617 苏桃 neutral]]
Tang Tang immediately clutched her forehead, quickly processing the information. "You mean... Chi Xiaocheng?" [[18618 唐糖 neutral]]
"Mhm!" [[18619 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao didn't hesitate at all and admitted it with a generous nod. [[18620 旁白 neutral]]
However, her slightly red ears revealed that she was a little shy. [[18621 旁白 neutral]]
But being able to admit so naturally in public that her girlfriend was Chi Xiaocheng was already a big step forward. [[18622 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao noticed the girl beside her drinking cola, looking a bit happy. "Cheng Cheng, what are you so happy about?" [[18623 苏桃 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng stood up and chuckled. "Because I'm on Team Cheng-Tao. Of course I'm happy to hear you say that." [[18624 程程 happy]]
But the happiness was only about that. [[18625 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng glanced at Tang Tang, and when their eyes met, her smile grew even brighter. [[18626 旁白 neutral]]
P.S. Recommending a friend's book, title: "We Were Rivals Yesterday, But Today You're My Wife?", author: Clockwork Girl. [[18627 旁白 neutral]]
I've read this book. The writing is good, the plot is logical, and the drama between the real and fake daughters is full of twists. It's a great read for those who enjoy close relationships, don't miss it. [[18628 旁白 neutral]]
