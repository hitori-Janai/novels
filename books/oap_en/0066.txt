Chapter 66 Brother Returns [[5787 旁白 neutral]]
Night fell like ink. While Chi Xiaocheng was worried about the psychologist, in Lizhi City, Chi Song had already bought a high-speed rail ticket back to Jiuzhou City. [[5788 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Long, I'm here to say goodbye." [[5789 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song walked into the hall wearing a jacket, shaking off the snowflakes from his head. His scarred face looked somewhat eerie. [[5790 旁白 neutral]]
Brother Long had only one ear, and like Chi Song, his face was also scarred. [[5791 旁白 neutral]]
He turned to look at Chi Song, then handed him a cigarette, "Are you really going back? To be honest, after this job, I planned to promote you to the Fourth Hall. If you leave now, others might criticize you." [[5792 龙哥 neutral]]
Chi Song took the cigarette. When he reached for his lighter, Brother Long offered him a light. [[5793 旁白 neutral]]
He exhaled a puff of smoke, "Brother Long, to be honest, I don't care about that position. You know I'm working hard here for my little sister. She usually doesn't tell me when she's in trouble. This is the first time she's asked for my help. As her brother, I have to go back." [[5794 池松 neutral]]
His fierce face revealed a simple smile, "Years ago, I wronged my parents and broke ties with them to join the underworld. She's my only sister now." [[5795 池松 sad]]
"That's true." Brother Long flicked his cigarette, "How long will you be gone?" [[5796 龙哥 neutral]]
"Not sure. I should be back within half a month." Chi Song smiled, "Just let Little Four take my place. He's more clever. But there's one thing, Brother Long, you need to pay attention to." [[5797 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song's expression became a little more serious, "Didn't we take down a batch of Ye family's underground businesses last time? Their hands haven't retracted yet. Recently, someone named Si contacted me and provided me with a lot of information about the Ye family." [[5798 池松 neutral]]
Brother Long raised an eyebrow, "Trying to use us as a weapon?" [[5799 龙哥 neutral]]
Chi Song nodded, "Probably. This batch of Ye family people were sent by Ye Liang. You need to consider whether to kill them, Brother Long." [[5800 池松 neutral]]
Brother Long sneered, "In Lizhi City, even a tiger has to lie low for me. Even if we agree, other gangs won't just watch their share of the pie being taken. You just go back. Don't worry about these things." [[5801 龙哥 neutral]]
"Alright." Chi Song nodded, "I'll take ten people back. I'll contact you, Brother Long, if anything happens." [[5802 池松 neutral]]
"Leaving directly this late?" [[5803 龙哥 neutral]]
"Yes, I've bought a high-speed rail ticket." [[5804 池松 neutral]]
Brother Long looked at Chi Song in surprise, "Songzi, I haven't treated you badly these past two years, have I? Isn't a few million enough for you to buy a car?" [[5805 龙哥 neutral]]
Chi Song scratched his head awkwardly, "My little sister has always been very weak. She suffered several mental traumas years ago. Didn't I meet a great doctor in my hometown before? He said the treatment would cost a lot of money, so I've been giving him all my money these past two years to help treat my little sister." [[5806 池松 neutral]]
Brother Long frowned, "What kind of injury costs millions? You weren't scammed, were you?" [[5807 龙哥 neutral]]
"Probably not. He often tells me about my little sister's situation, and he has photos too. Last time I video called my little sister, she looked quite energetic." [[5808 池松 neutral]]
"Besides, money is meant to be spent, isn't it? My little sister's good complexion proves that the money was well spent, no harm done." [[5809 池松 neutral]]
"Alright." Brother Long saw this and said no more. Instead, he picked up a key from the table and threw it over, "Also, you're already a boss, and you have many subordinates. What kind of image is it to take your subordinates back home by high-speed rail?" [[5810 龙哥 neutral]]
"Take my car back, and then have your subordinates pick up two more cars. You don't have to rush back. Spend more time with your sister." [[5811 龙哥 neutral]]
"Okay, thank you, Brother Long!" [[5812 池松 happy]]
"Thank me for what? If you hadn't blocked a knife for me back then, I wouldn't have just lost an ear. Now get lost. If you're in a hurry to go back, don't be sentimental with me here." [[5813 龙哥 neutral]]
After sending Chi Song away, Brother Long lit another cigarette and tapped on the table. [[5814 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, another subordinate came in, "Brother Long, what are your orders?" [[5815 小弟 neutral]]
"Send someone to investigate that doctor Chi Song contacted, see what he's about. Also, aren't there a few disabled guys in the gang who keep saying they want to find some work?" [[5816 龙哥 neutral]]
"Yes." The subordinate nodded, "You sent them to guard the warehouse, but they said it was too boring and they wanted to continue mixing with the gang like Deputy Hall Master Chi. Missing hands and feet doesn't matter." [[5817 小弟 neutral]]
"A bunch of stubborn donkeys." Brother Long flicked his cigarette ash, "Send them to Chi Song's hometown. Let them find a piece of land there to farm and retire. Tell them their mission is to protect Chi Song's parents. Go." [[5818 龙哥 neutral]]
After saying that, Brother Long smoked and looked out the window, his face heavy. [[5819 旁白 neutral]]
"Jiuzhou City is the Ye family's base... it's not easy to deal with." [[5820 龙哥 neutral]]
Time gradually passed. After a seven-hour journey, Chi Song and ten subordinates drove into Jiuzhou City. [[5821 旁白 neutral]]
It was already 3 AM. Although the three subordinates in Chi Song's car were tired, their faces still showed a hint of anticipation. [[5822 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Song, we'll be at your house in half an hour. What's your sister's name? Orange, right? Will I be able to call her sister then?" [[5823 小弟 neutral]]
The dark-skinned man driving was in a good mood. [[5824 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song chuckled, "Old Hei, if you dare to have any ideas about my little sister, I'll break your legs." [[5825 池松 neutral]]
"Hey, what are you saying?" Liang Hei shrugged, "We're brothers. Your little sister is naturally my little sister. I'm old and don't have a family. I probably won't find a wife. Can't I even fulfill this small wish of hearing our sister call me brother?" [[5826 梁黑 neutral]]
"Get lost. You're old enough to be an uncle." [[5827 池松 neutral]]
"I'm only 28, what uncle? I'm still young!" [[5828 梁黑 neutral]]
Chi Song said seriously, "Let's agree beforehand, if you really see her, don't mention anything about the gang, okay? We brothers all met while working and moving bricks." [[5829 池松 neutral]]
"But speaking of which, I haven't seen my little sister in almost three years. I wonder how she's doing now. I hope she doesn't despise me for being disabled." [[5830 池松 sad]]
While chatting, they soon arrived at the community gate. [[5831 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since Brother Long gave him this house, Chi Song had never lived in it. He just let Chi Xiaocheng keep a room for herself, filling it with a few daily necessities, waiting for him to return. [[5832 旁白 neutral]]
Who knew he hadn't returned even once until now. [[5833 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Song, we're going to the hotel first." [[5834 小弟 neutral]]
"Wait!" [[5835 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song sat in the car, squinting his eyes, and stopped Liang Hei, who was about to get out. [[5836 旁白 neutral]]
Liang Hei noticed Chi Song's serious expression and flashed the car lights twice. The doors of the other two cars, which had just opened, closed again. [[5837 旁白 neutral]]
"This place is being watched." [[5838 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song turned his head and looked at the two burly men eating late-night snacks at a roadside stall not far away. [[5839 旁白 neutral]]
Across the road, there was another guy wrapped in a cotton coat sleeping on a bench. [[5840 旁白 neutral]]
At first glance, they were amateurs. Their eyes and heads occasionally turned towards them. [[5841 旁白 neutral]]
Liang Hei's voice deepened slightly, "There are only three people visible on the surface. We just arrived and they're already watching us. We just got to Jiuzhou City, and we're already being targeted? That fast?" [[5842 梁黑 neutral]]
"My little sister is being targeted!" [[5843 池松 angry]]
Chi Song's face darkened. He originally thought that his little sister's "being bullied" meant some thugs were bothering her. [[5844 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't expect the situation to be much more serious than he thought. [[5845 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Song, what should we do?" [[5846 梁黑 neutral]]
