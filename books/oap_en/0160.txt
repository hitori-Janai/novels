Chapter 160: Alive, but Not Completely [[14038 旁白 neutral]]
In the dead of night, the quiet hospital only had a few night-shift nurses on duty. [[14039 旁白 neutral]]
A man, 1.9 meters tall, walked in from the entrance and went straight to the 5th floor. [[14040 旁白 neutral]]
"Master Si Chen, what brings you here so late?" [[14041 护士 neutral]]
"Yes, I'm here to see Chi Xiaocheng. Where is she?" [[14042 司辰 neutral]]
"Miss Chi... I'll take you to her. It's such a shame that something like this happened to such a beautiful and lovely girl. Sigh..." [[14043 护士 sad]]
Following the young nurse, Si Chen arrived in front of Chi Xiaocheng. [[14044 旁白 neutral]]
It had been three days. This was the first time he had come to see the sickly girl since the accident happened. [[14045 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen walked into the hospital room, turned on a small lamp, and closed the door behind him. Looking at her pretty, Sleeping Beauty-like face, he sighed, "Chi Xiaocheng, oh, Chi Xiaocheng, why did you have to do this? First you tried to take your own life, and now an accident like this happens." [[14046 司辰 sad]]
"For you, I had the words 'Never Love Tao' branded on my back. For your plan, I even guided Su Tao to be your wingman." [[14047 司辰 sad]]
"I was even planning to be your best man when you and Su Tao got married after her War God father returned. Then I could use her father's influence to return to the Si family..." [[14048 司辰 sad]]
"Sigh!" [[14049 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen pulled over a chair, sat down, and punched his own thigh with a clenched fist. [[14050 旁白 angry]]
Because of this incident with Ye Liang, his easy path to revenge had become difficult again. [[14051 旁白 neutral]]
After a long silence, Si Chen suddenly noticed that besides the ECG monitor, Chi Xiaocheng was connected to many other devices, big and small. [[14052 旁白 neutral]]
She was even on an IV drip, seemingly to supply her body with nutrients. [[14053 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, Si Chen stood up, realizing something was wrong. [[14054 旁白 neutral]]
"If she were really dead, shouldn't they be trying to preserve the body? Why are they trying to save her?" [[14055 司辰 neutral]]
Although he wasn't an expert in medicine, he was experienced with the world. The equipment and drugs being used were undoubtedly top-of-the-line. [[14056 旁白 neutral]]
"This is so strange!" [[14057 司辰 neutral]]
It was no exaggeration to say that Si Chen understood Chi Xiaocheng better than anyone, especially her yandere side. [[14058 旁白 neutral]]
This situation could only mean one thing. [[14059 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng is faking her death!" [[14060 司辰 happy]]
As soon as he had this thought, everything became clear to Si Chen. [[14061 旁白 happy]]
Just like her last attempt on her own life, this was all to manipulate Su Tao! [[14062 旁白 neutral]]
"If this is all part of her plan, that would explain why they're using such expensive equipment to keep her alive even though she's dead. Maybe..." [[14063 司辰 neutral]]
"Maybe the ECG monitor is fake, too." [[14064 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen stared at the flat line on the ECG, his eyes shining with focus. [[14065 旁白 neutral]]
He took a deep breath, checked that there were no cameras, and after locking the door and windows, he said to Chi Xiaocheng in a low voice, "Chi Xiaocheng, you can stop pretending. I know you're faking your death. It's just us here, so we can discuss what to do next." [[14066 司辰 neutral]]
After he spoke, Chi Xiaocheng still didn't react. [[14067 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen frowned. "There's no need for this. Can you not even trust me?" [[14068 司辰 neutral]]
Strange. [[14069 旁白 neutral]]
Could his guess have been wrong? [[14070 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen thought for ten seconds, then his expression became determined. He lowered his voice and said, "Chi Xiaocheng, it would be a real shame if you just left like this. To be honest, I've always secretly had a crush on Su Tao." [[14071 司辰 neutral]]
"After you're gone, she won't have anyone left to love." [[14072 司辰 sad]]
"So, I'll just have to take care of Su Tao for you." [[14073 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen let out a long sigh. "If we get married one day, I'll come to your grave to burn some in... Wh-what the?!" [[14074 司辰 neutral]]
Before Si Chen could finish, he was so startled that he stumbled back two steps. [[14075 旁白 neutral]]
The previously flat line on the ECG had suddenly jumped twice, creating a tiny ripple! [[14076 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, lying peacefully on the bed, had a small hand outside the blanket, and her index finger twitched for a moment. [[14077 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at her pretty face, she still seemed to be sleeping peacefully. [[14078 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if the whole thing had been a hallucination. [[14079 旁白 neutral]]
But Si Chen didn't think so. He had clearly seen Chi Xiaocheng move, just for a second! [[14080 旁白 neutral]]
Correct password. System boot successful. [[14081 旁白 neutral]]
Even without consciousness, the System's voice echoed in Chi Xiaocheng's mind. [[14082 旁白 neutral]]
[Host's death confirmed...] [[14083 系统 neutral]]
[Scarecrow Substitute successfully used...] [[14084 系统 neutral]]
[Current status: Feigned Death] [[14085 系统 neutral]]
[The "Orange Cells" derived from the scarecrow are repairing the body...] [[14086 系统 neutral]]
[Time remaining for repair: 46 days] [[14087 系统 neutral]]
[Host has a strong urge to awaken...] [[14088 系统 neutral]]
[Waking up consciousness ahead of schedule...] [[14089 系统 neutral]]
[Welcome back, Host.] [[14090 系统 happy]]
The person on the bed still hadn't moved. At some point, Si Chen had taken off his shirt, revealing the four words "Never Love Tao," despite the cold weather. [[14091 旁白 neutral]]
What he didn't know was that the person on the bed had indeed entered a state of "death" and wouldn't wake up until her body had finished repairing itself. [[14092 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, in a small drawer in Chi Xiaocheng's room, the eyes of a small scarecrow doll suddenly glowed red. [[14093 旁白 neutral]]
"System, where is Si Chen?" [[14094 池小橙 angry]]
The scarecrow opened its mouth, and a clear, cute voice came out. [[14095 旁白 neutral]]
It was a cute-looking doll with a hole over its heart, but now its eyes were glowing with a crimson light, looking rather creepy in the small, dark drawer. [[14096 旁白 neutral]]
The System quickly spoke. [[14097 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, calm down! You're already dead right now!] [[14098 系统 neutral]]
Her body was also not her original one anymore. [[14099 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took two steps, felt something was off, and then realized she had turned into a scarecrow-like doll! [[14100 旁白 neutral]]
"System, what's going on? Explain." [[14101 池小橙 neutral]]
Her memory stopped at the moment she was hit by the sniper rifle. [[14102 旁白 neutral]]
As the pain spread through her body, Chi Xiaocheng truly felt like she was going to die. [[14103 旁白 sad]]
Her mind went blank, and she even forgot she had the Scarecrow Substitute. With all her strength, she told Su Tao what she truly thought and wished for. [[14104 旁白 sad]]
And then... [[14105 旁白 neutral]]
She woke up to this. [[14106 旁白 neutral]]
[After your death was confirmed, you entered a state of feigned death. When the scarecrow took your place, the Orange Cells added to your body began to slowly repair it. Normally, you should only be able to vaguely sense the outside world in this state.] [[14107 系统 neutral]]
[You were supposed to wake up only after the repairs were complete, but Si Chen triggered your strong desire to awaken.] [[14108 系统 neutral]]
[That body is too severely injured to handle your consciousness and wake up.] [[14109 系统 neutral]]
[So I transferred your consciousness to this Scarecrow Substitute.] [[14110 系统 neutral]]
Alive, but not completely alive. [[14111 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng roughly understood now. She was alive thanks to the System's power, and the strange cells in her body were some kind of medical miracle. [[14112 旁白 neutral]]
But in her current supernatural state as a doll, wouldn't people be scared to death if they saw her? [[14113 旁白 neutral]]
More importantly, a small doll clearly couldn't do anything. [[14114 旁白 sad]]
"Wait..." [[14115 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng suddenly remembered that it wasn't true that she could do nothing. [[14116 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly looked at her skill panel. [[14117 旁白 neutral]]
[Disguise (Intermediate)] [[14118 系统 neutral]]
[Can disguise as another person. Appearance, height, and bone structure can be freely changed, but cannot violate basic human anatomy. Limited to females. Can be used once a week. Disguise duration: 3 hours.] [[14119 系统 neutral]]
PS: There will be no body-swapping drama. The author finds the idea of self-cucking to be toxic, and Tao would never fall for a so-called replacement for Cheng. Cheng and Tao are a 1v1 pure love ship, locked in. The author won't write anything toxic, so please rest assured. [[14120 作者 neutral]]
Don't rush the upcoming content. The plot will unfold slowly from the groundwork that has been laid. The angst, sweetness, twistedness, and yandere moments you want to see will all be there. [[14121 作者 neutral]]
