Chapter 246 Hating My Increasingly Filthy Self [[21018 旁白 sad]]
In her view, Si Chen was circling Chi Xiaocheng, stroking his chin as if giving his opinion on her outfit. [[21019 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Dongfang Yang was having a great time. Unable to stay serious for long, after his recent knightly bow, he excitedly said the scene had a great feel to it and that he wanted to do something even cooler next time. [[21020 旁白 neutral]]
He even wanted to get a ceremonial sword. [[21021 旁白 neutral]]
His inner teenager was running wild, and Chi Xiaocheng, listening from the side, shook her head with a sigh. [[21022 旁白 neutral]]
It didn't seem like a big deal, right? [[21023 苏桃 neutral]]
But to outsiders, even without looking through rose-tinted glasses, it was a scene of two handsome young masters, Si Chen and Dongfang Yang, doing everything they could to please the little princess between them. [[21024 旁白 neutral]]
The little princess was clearly enjoying the atmosphere, smiling as she basked in the attention and praise of the two. [[21025 旁白 happy]]
Suddenly, a "click" sound was heard next to Su Tao. [[21026 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly glanced over and saw a girl she didn't recognize. The girl was also in a princess dress, showing off her fair shoulders and long legs, but aside from being revealing, the dress's quality was clearly quite average. [[21027 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the photo she had just taken, her eyes filled with envy. "It must be so nice to be in the middle of that..." [[21028 陌生女1 sad]]
Noticing Su Tao's gaze, the girl chuckled. "Sorry, that was a bit embarrassing. To be honest, almost every girl here has a crush on Dongfang Yang and Si Chen. I'm just really envious of the girl they're spoiling in the middle." [[21029 陌生女1 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and asked, puzzled, "There's nothing to be envious about. They both... clearly treat her like a little sister, don't they?" [[21030 苏桃 neutral]]
"A sister?" The girl gave Su Tao a surprised look. "I might believe that if you were talking about Dongfang Yang, but Si Chen isn't the type to do anything unless he gets something out of it. Would he really be so caring if he just saw her as a sister?" [[21031 陌生女1 neutral]]
With that, the girl prepared to delete the photo. Seeing this, Su Tao quickly stopped her. "Wait... can you send me that picture?" [[21032 苏桃 neutral]]
"You want it? Sure." [[21033 陌生女1 neutral]]
They added each other as friends, and Su Tao got the photo. [[21034 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang and Si Chen surrounded Chi Xiaocheng, and the light happened to fall on the three of them. But since it was a candid shot, the overall lighting wasn't great. Dongfang Yang and Si Chen were bright, but Chi Xiaocheng, in the middle, appeared a bit dim. [[21035 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao casually opened a photo editor. After adjusting the brightness, she moved to the contrast setting. [[21036 旁白 neutral]]
Her index finger slid across the screen. [[21037 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, the photo became overexposed. Dongfang Yang and Si Chen were washed out and blurry, but Chi Xiaocheng, caught in the middle, was bright and captivating. [[21038 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she belonged to no one, untouchable. [[21039 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's hand, which had been adjusting the photo, suddenly froze. [[21040 旁白 sad]]
Slowly, she exited the editing app. [[21041 旁白 sad]]
She looked at the photo again. [[21042 旁白 sad]]
Then, she looked up at Chi Xiaocheng, still the center of attention, and whispered, "You're a little too dazzling." [[21043 苏桃 sad]]
Just then, having finished her chat with Dongfang Yang and Si Chen, Chi Xiaocheng turned to Su Tao and walked over. "So, what do you think?" [[21044 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao froze for a second, then managed a small smile. "You look beautiful." [[21045 苏桃 happy]]
--Not beautiful at all. [[21046 苏桃 angry]]
"You always used to dress so plainly. Seeing you like this for the first time is really stunning." [[21047 苏桃 happy]]
--It was better when you were plain. No one would have noticed you. Only with me were you a treasure. [[21048 苏桃 angry]]
"I'm so happy for you that you've become so popular, Xiaocheng. As long as you like it, that's what matters." [[21049 苏桃 happy]]
--What is there to be happy about? You're getting so much attention now. Aren't you just getting further and further away from me?! [[21050 苏桃 angry]]
After several days of acting lessons focused on facial expressions, Su Tao hadn't learned much, but she could at least control her emotions better than before. [[21051 旁白 neutral]]
She knew her thoughts were disgusting. [[21052 旁白 sad]]
But on her face, she still wore a smile that seemed happy for Chi Xiaocheng. [[21053 旁白 neutral]]
And because of these thoughts, she hated herself even more. [[21054 旁白 sad]]
The party hadn't started, but guests were already arriving. Due to her health, Chi Xiaocheng didn't walk around much. She found a warm spot and sat there like a quiet little doll. [[21055 旁白 neutral]]
She looked as delicate as a porcelain doll, and nearly every guest who entered the main hall was drawn to her. [[21056 旁白 neutral]]
Then they would start to whisper. [[21057 旁白 neutral]]
They wondered which family this little princess belonged to; they had never seen her at any of the previous parties. [[21058 旁白 neutral]]
By now, Chi Xiaocheng was starting to regret it. [[21059 旁白 sad]]
She wanted to create a dazzling image to send Su Tao a message: "If you don't hold onto me, I'll slip further away." She had asked Si Chen to pick a nice outfit, but nothing too revealing. [[21060 旁白 neutral]]
This was the result. She was indeed stunning, the most eye-catching person in the room. [[21061 旁白 neutral]]
But Tao Tao... [[21062 池小橙 sad]]
What the heck are you doing, standing over there like a block of wood? If you care about me, stand by my side and prove to everyone who you are! [[21063 池小橙 angry]]
What's with acting like a stranger and talking about me with other people? Aren't you afraid some other rich guy will come and steal me away?! [[21064 池小橙 angry]]
Not that I could be stolen away, but I need you to be more assertive! [[21065 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng screamed inwardly. But now that all eyes were on her, she couldn't do anything to influence Su Tao's thoughts. [[21066 旁白 neutral]]
She was starting to understand why, in the original 4-million-word novel, Su Tao remained untouched until the very end. [[21067 旁白 neutral]]
She was as straight as a steel bar and so strong that no domineering CEO could handle her. [[21068 旁白 neutral]]
She was waiting for Su Tao to act, but Su Tao, full of self-loathing and lacking confidence, felt too intimidated to approach the radiant Chi Xiaocheng. [[21069 旁白 sad]]
She scanned the crowd and soon found her middle school friend, Tang Tang. [[21070 旁白 neutral]]
She was still dressed like a tomboy. She waved at Su Tao and looked around curiously. "Where's Xiaochengzi? Why are you alone?" [[21071 唐糖 neutral]]
"She's over there." Su Tao pointed to Chi Xiaocheng, who was sitting gracefully on a soft sofa. [[21072 苏桃 neutral]]
Instantly, the wine glass in Tang Tang's hand slipped and crashed to the floor with a "bang". [[21073 旁白 neutral]]
She stared, dumbfounded, at Chi Xiaocheng, who looked like a princess or an angel. "Wait a second, is that kid Xiaochengzi? Did you..." [[21074 唐糖 happy]]
Before she could say the word "partner," Su Tao had already covered her mouth. [[21075 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of the shattering glass had already drawn everyone's attention. [[21076 旁白 neutral]]
If she let her shout that, Su Tao wouldn't know what to do. [[21077 旁白 neutral]]
She lowered her voice and said to Tang Tang, "Please don't shout it out. We haven't even gotten to that stage yet. What would Xiaocheng do if you yelled that?" [[21078 苏桃 sad]]
Tang Tang blinked, signaling Su Tao to let go. She then quickly put her hands together in apology. "Sorry, I got too excited. I just remember Xiaocheng from middle school, always trailing after you looking clumsy and a bit messy, wearing that same old jacket with messy hair." [[21079 唐糖 neutral]]
"I really never expected her to become so beautiful and cute after just a few years!" [[21080 唐糖 happy]]
Tang Tang took a deep breath, turned to Su Tao, and said very seriously, "Taozi, if I didn't know you and Xiaocheng were a couple, I would totally try to win her over myself." [[21081 唐糖 happy]]
