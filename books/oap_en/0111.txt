Chapter 111: Great, Xiaocheng is Getting More and More Normal [[9668 旁白 neutral]]
She had other things to do. [[9669 旁白 neutral]]
For more than ten days, although she came over every day for a while, she only stayed over twice. [[9670 旁白 sad]]
The number of times she had slept hugging Su Tao was far less than with the big brown bear. [[9671 旁白 sad]]
Occasionally, Dawang, the proud tabby cat, would crawl into her bed, and its soft fur was a little more comfortable than the big brown bear. [[9672 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened her mouth, then lowered her head again. [[9673 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, she didn't say anything to throw a tantrum. [[9674 旁白 neutral]]
Looking up again, her smile was relaxed. "Then Taotao, you should get some rest. Don't tire yourself out, okay?" [[9675 池小橙 happy]]
"Okay!" [[9676 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao reached out and patted Chi Xiaocheng's head, her own smile just as relaxed and content. [[9677 旁白 happy]]
She said, "But I won't leave so soon. It's only 6 o'clock now. I'll leave at 8. Is there anything in the fridge? How about we have dinner first?" [[9678 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng pulled Su Tao to sit on the sofa and said with concern, "Let's order takeout. You're injured, so you shouldn't trouble yourself." [[9679 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao blinked. "Then is there anything Xiaocheng wants to do?" [[9680 苏桃 neutral]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng ran to her room and picked up the sleeping Dawang. [[9681 旁白 neutral]]
Ignoring the cat's struggles, she held it up to Su Tao. "Hold the kitty for ten minutes, then hold me." [[9682 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Why is there an order?" [[9683 苏桃 happy]]
"Taotao likes cats a lot. Let Dawang get close to Taotao." [[9684 池小橙 happy]]
With an indulgent smile, Su Tao reached out and took Dawang. [[9685 旁白 happy]]
The proud tabby cat looked slightly displeased, but it still buried itself in Su Tao's arms. [[9686 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao patted Dawang's head again and said playfully, "Actually, I can hold you and Dawang at the same time. Neither of you is very heavy." [[9687 苏桃 happy]]
"No way." Chi Xiaocheng lifted her chin and sat next to Su Tao. "Only I can be in Taotao's arms. Dawang doesn't count as a person, so she can only stay for a little while at most." [[9688 池小橙 angry]]
She was even jealous of a cat. [[9689 苏桃 neutral]]
But it was because I always went along with her that she hadn't had an episode in the past half a month. [[9690 苏桃 neutral]]
That's why she has been so well-behaved and cute. [[9691 苏桃 happy]]
In that case... [[9692 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao tossed Dawang aside. [[9693 旁白 neutral]]
The cat did a spin in mid-air and landed precisely in a trash bin that only had two dry tissues in it. [[9694 旁白 neutral]]
Dawang looked up, confused, only to see that its two owners were about to cuddle. [[9695 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao reached out and pulled Chi Xiaocheng into her arms. "Then I won't hold Dawang. You're my important little cutie." [[9696 苏桃 happy]]
She gently pinched Chi Xiaocheng's nose, and with her other hand, she played with her light brown hair. [[9697 旁白 happy]]
The latter leaned into her embrace, and noticing that Su Tao seemed to like playing with her hair, she shifted from leaning to a lap pillow. [[9698 旁白 happy]]
Lying on her side, she enjoyed having her head stroked. [[9699 旁白 happy]]
A sweet feeling grew in her heart. Chi Xiaocheng truly wished this moment could last forever. [[9700 旁白 happy]]
The bright light shone down, illuminating her and Su Tao's pretty faces. Dawang tried to squeeze onto Su Tao's lap but was mercilessly kicked aside by Chi Xiaocheng. [[9701 旁白 neutral]]
And in the shadows where the light couldn't reach, a voice full of envy and longing was heard, "How nice, such a heartwarming scene." [[9702 Dark Xiaocheng neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened her eyes to glance at her, then closed them again to continue enjoying the moment. [[9703 旁白 neutral]]
It was Dark Xiaocheng again, the inner demon born from her delusions, always trying to tempt her. [[9704 旁白 neutral]]
Whatever. If I ignore her, she'll disappear on her own. [[9705 池小橙 neutral]]
Faced with Chi Xiaocheng's silence, Dark Xiaocheng didn't get angry. Instead, she said lightly, "A lap pillow like this must be very comfortable, right?" [[9706 Dark Xiaocheng neutral]]
"Warm, comfortable, and soft. Just by resting in this embrace, you can enjoy the faint scent from Su Tao's body and her gentle touch." [[9707 Dark Xiaocheng neutral]]
"But have you noticed that she's spending less and less time here?" [[9708 Dark Xiaocheng sad]]
"She's getting busier and busier outside." [[9709 Dark Xiaocheng sad]]
"Since you want to freeze time here forever, why not just possess her?" [[9710 Dark Xiaocheng angry]]
"Wouldn't it be better to take off this well-behaved mask of a 'normal person'?" [[9711 Dark Xiaocheng angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng kept her eyes closed, still unmoved. [[9712 旁白 neutral]]
Saying that she was coming here less and less was just a trick. [[9713 池小橙 angry]]
She just wants to ruin the relationship between me and Taotao! [[9714 池小橙 angry]]
With her silence, the tempting voice turned into a sigh. [[9715 旁白 neutral]]
When she opened her eyes again, she saw her watching, a bit lost in thought. She hadn't left, but she didn't say anything more. [[9716 旁白 neutral]]
The tender moment was brief. After a mediocre dinner, they watched some TV together. [[9717 旁白 neutral]]
As it neared 8 o'clock, Su Tao got up to leave. "Xiaocheng, I have to go. I'll come again next time." [[9718 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded obediently but still asked, "Who are you going to see, Taotao?" [[9719 池小橙 neutral]]
"Si Chen." [[9720 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao said a name. "I need to ask him for a small favor." [[9721 苏桃 neutral]]
After tying her shoes, Su Tao didn't notice the sad expression on Chi Xiaocheng's face as she bit her lower lip. She turned and waved goodbye, "I'll come see you tomorrow. Bye-bye, Xiaocheng!" [[9722 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng suddenly looked up, a smile on her face, "Bye-bye~ Be careful on your way, and don't fall again." [[9723 池小橙 happy]]
"Bang—!" [[9724 旁白 neutral]]
The door closed heavily. [[9725 旁白 neutral]]
The entryway, barely touched by the warm air from the AC, gradually grew cold. [[9726 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the door, Su Tao rubbed her hands together and let out a light breath. [[9727 旁白 neutral]]
The corners of her lips turned up unconsciously. "Half a month has passed. Xiaocheng has been unbelievably well-behaved, without any signs of being yandere. It seems she's steadily returning to normal." [[9728 苏桃 happy]]
"This is what a successful treatment looks like, right?" [[9729 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao took out her phone, happily wanting to share the good news with Doctor Cheng, but then remembered he had said he was very busy recently. [[9730 旁白 neutral]]
So she sent a message to her friend Chengcheng instead, "Chengzi is becoming more and more well-behaved. I feel like it won't be long before I completely cure her yandere tendencies." [[9731 苏桃 happy]]
Chengcheng replied instantly: "Congrats, Taozi! I was a little worried when you described how serious it was." [[9732 Chengcheng happy]]
Taozi: "I still have to thank you for your suggestion, Chengcheng. The path of making her controllable really works. I always emphasize that I won't leave her if she's good, and she really has become very good." [[9733 苏桃 happy]]
Chengcheng: "Hehe, I've been reading up on psychology books recently. These are just little tricks. As long as you keep spoiling her like this, she'll slowly get better." [[9734 Chengcheng happy]]
Taozi: "Mhm, when we have time, how about we meet up for a meal? Our schools aren't far from each other." [[9735 苏桃 happy]]
Chengcheng: "Let's wait for winter break. I'm swamped with finals right now!" [[9736 Chengcheng neutral]]
Taozi: "Hhh, okay." [[9737 苏桃 happy]]
Chengcheng: "By the way, let me ask you something. Do you like Chengzi being so well-behaved?" [[9738 Chengcheng neutral]]
Taozi: "Why do you ask?" [[9739 苏桃 neutral]]
Taozi: "If I have to say, of course I like it." [[9740 苏桃 happy]]
Chengcheng: "It's good that you like it, hehe." [[9741 Chengcheng happy]]
The chat ended. Su Tao put her phone away and walked into the elevator, shaking her head helplessly. [[9742 旁白 neutral]]
"I always feel like Chengcheng can be a bit random sometimes, but I guess that's what online friends are like. It's really nice to meet someone like this in the vast sea of people." [[9743 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao reflected that she had chatted a lot with Chengcheng over the past half month. [[9744 旁白 neutral]]
The other person was also interested in yandere studies, and what was even more surprising was that they had many similar hobbies. [[9745 旁白 happy]]
A kindred spirit is hard to find. [[9746 旁白 happy]]
Those words were so true. [[9747 旁白 happy]]
"Xiaocheng isn't yandere anymore, and she's not as clingy as before. Maybe the medicine is working too. In this case, she'll understand if I get a little busier with my own things, right?" [[9748 苏桃 happy]]
Stepping out of the residential complex, Su Tao opened her umbrella and looked up at the falling snow. [[9749 旁白 neutral]]
Even though the streetlights were dim, reflected in her eyes, the road ahead was becoming clearer and clearer. [[9750 旁白 happy]]
