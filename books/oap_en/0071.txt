Chapter 71 What I Like Is Not the Steamed Bun, But You [[6200 旁白 neutral]]
At 8 AM, Chi Xiaocheng deliberately skipped breakfast, planning to leave early to find Su Tao at school, sneak into her dorm, and give her a surprise hug. [[6201 旁白 neutral]]
But what she didn't expect was. [[6202 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was even earlier than her. [[6203 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she arrived in the living room and took a sip of hot water, the doorbell rang. [[6204 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't even need to open the door. Su Tao, who had already registered her fingerprint, opened the door and walked in. [[6205 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, I'm here." [[6206 苏桃 neutral]]
She had promised to go on a date on Saturday, and she was more punctual than anyone. [[6207 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao tapped the fine snow off her boots, and just as she was about to enter, she paused, "Brother Chi Song?!" [[6208 苏桃 surprised]]
Su Tao's voice was filled with surprise and joy. When she saw Chi Song's single arm, her heart couldn't help but tighten. [[6209 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song smiled faintly, "I had a small accident while working outside, it's nothing. It's been many years, Xiao Tao, you've become even more beautiful." [[6210 池松 neutral]]
Su Tao's face showed a hint of embarrassment, "Brother Chi Song, don't tease me. How can I be considered beautiful? I'm just..." [[6211 苏桃 neutral]]
Before she could finish, she saw Chi Song nod in satisfaction again, "You're so beautiful, and little sister is so cute. You two look very compatible." [[6212 池松 neutral]]
Girl and loli. [[6213 旁白 neutral]]
The scene was also quite beautiful. [[6214 旁白 neutral]]
Many things had happened these past few days, and Su Tao had almost forgotten what Chi Song had asked her last time. [[6215 旁白 neutral]]
Do you like my little sister? [[6216 旁白 neutral]]
How could a brother try to set up two sisters?! [[6217 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao knew that Chi Song was a super straight man, so maybe he really thought that way. [[6218 旁白 neutral]]
Her smile suddenly became a little awkward. [[6219 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song laughed, "Didn't you two grow up together like this? What's wrong with that? Alright, you two chat first. I have something to do, so I'm going out." [[6220 池松 neutral]]
Watching Chi Song leave, Su Tao finally turned her attention back to the living room, only to find that Chi Xiaocheng had already appeared in front of her at some point. [[6221 旁白 neutral]]
She was looking down, staring intently at the thick tights she wore for warmth. [[6222 旁白 neutral]]
Today, considering she was going out, she wore a light pink woolen coat with a simple white turtleneck sweater inside, warm and comfortable. [[6223 旁白 neutral]]
Her lower body was a pair of beige warm tights paired with brown short boots, the smooth lines making her legs appear long. [[6224 旁白 neutral]]
After confirming her gaze, it was food-grade. [[6225 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a little uncomfortable under Chi Xiaocheng's gaze, "Xia... Xiaocheng, what's wrong?" [[6226 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up faintly at Su Tao, "Are you going out like this?" [[6227 池小橙 neutral]]
"Is there... something wrong?" [[6228 苏桃 neutral]]
Although not very fashionable, this was a relatively normal outfit for the current season. [[6229 旁白 neutral]]
Unexpectedly, Chi Xiaocheng very seriously pointed to her thigh, covered by thick stockings, "This, cannot be shown to others!" [[6230 池小橙 angry]]
"Huh?" [[6231 苏桃 surprised]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a step closer, almost pressing against Su Tao's body, "Above the neck, hands, and no short skirts. This is the maximum outside!" [[6232 池小橙 angry]]
Seeing the crimson eyes gradually fill with resentment, Su Tao swallowed and nodded slightly. [[6233 旁白 neutral]]
This was the possessiveness of a yandere! [[6234 旁白 neutral]]
And also the sickness of a yandere. [[6235 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, Chi Xiaocheng showed the cuteness of a yandere. [[6236 旁白 neutral]]
She cupped her face with both hands, her ears slightly red, and said shyly, "O-of course, if we're at home, Tao Tao can wear anything you want. I... I'll like it all." [[6237 池小橙 neutral]]
The huge difference before and after made it feel like it wasn't the same person. [[6238 旁白 neutral]]
However, it was undeniable that the contrast of fiercely speaking sweet nothings one moment and then blushing shyly the next was very cute. [[6239 旁白 neutral]]
The pressure dissipated, and Su Tao couldn't help but smile. [[6240 旁白 neutral]]
She put her hands on her hips and pointed at Chi Xiaocheng, "Then what about you, Xiaocheng? Aren't you dressed like this too?" [[6241 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was wearing a newly bought down coat today, its hem reaching her calves. She also wore thick warm stockings on her legs. [[6242 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up and giggled, "I'm wearing it for you to see, Tao Tao. Do you like it?" [[6243 池小橙 happy]]
She lifted the hem of her coat and twirled around lightly, as if she wasn't wearing a coat, but a skirt. [[6244 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hummed softly, "Since you won't let me wear this out, then I won't let you wear this out either!" [[6245 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng paused, then raised her cute smiling face, revealing her sharp little fangs, "Okay~ Tao Tao is mine, and I am Tao Tao's!" [[6246 池小橙 happy]]
The two looked at each other. [[6247 旁白 neutral]]
Neither could hold back, and they both laughed lightly. [[6248 旁白 neutral]]
In the joy, one was extremely satisfied, and the other was a little shy. [[6249 旁白 neutral]]
This was just shopping, just pretending to be on a date with her. [[6250 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao thought to herself, and changed into a pair of long pants with Chi Xiaocheng. [[6251 旁白 neutral]]
Her precious legs were hidden. [[6252 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao turned her head and asked, "Xiaocheng, where are you planning to go today?" [[6253 苏桃 neutral]]
"I'll listen to Tao Tao~" [[6254 池小橙 neutral]]
"I knew you'd say that." Su Tao took out her phone and looked at the arrangements and plans she had made last night. [[6255 旁白 neutral]]
She walked into the elevator with Chi Xiaocheng and said, "You haven't had breakfast yet, have you? How about we go have breakfast together first, then go to Dongfang Yang's cafe and sit for the morning? You can't keep skipping work there." [[6256 苏桃 neutral]]
"What then?" [[6257 池小橙 neutral]]
"The weather forecast says it will snow in the afternoon. How about we go to a cat cafe in the afternoon? I feel like Xiaocheng and cats are a good match. Then in the evening, we'll go shopping at the commercial center." [[6258 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay~" [[6259 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng naturally didn't mind Su Tao's arrangements. With a smile, she took Su Tao's hand and walked out. [[6260 旁白 neutral]]
On the street, she walked ahead, pointing her index finger at a snowy scene in front and talking about something. [[6261 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was half-dragged behind, occasionally nodding, her face full of indulgence and helplessness. [[6262 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng seemed to be constantly aware of what was behind her. Whenever Su Tao looked at her, she would turn around at the right moment. [[6263 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled. [[6264 旁白 neutral]]
Pure and healing. [[6265 旁白 neutral]]
As if ripples flowed through her eyes, Su Tao had a vision of scenes from her childhood. [[6266 旁白 neutral]]
Wasn't Chi Xiaocheng just like this now, preparing gifts, then holding her hand and leading her to various mysterious places, as if guiding her forward? [[6267 旁白 neutral]]
In reality, those so-called gifts. [[6268 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps it was a flower crown she wove, a small clay figure she molded, a lollipop she secretly bought, or sometimes, just a smile. [[6269 旁白 neutral]]
To be moved by the scene, it was indeed so. [[6270 旁白 neutral]]
In a blink of an eye. [[6271 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like everything had changed, and yet nothing had changed. [[6272 旁白 neutral]]
She had grown up. [[6273 旁白 neutral]]
In her eyes, there was more love and affection. [[6274 旁白 neutral]]
"Steamed bun, want some?" [[6275 池小橙 neutral]]
In a trance, Chi Xiaocheng held a bamboo skewer, offering a small steamed bun. [[6276 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled easily, brushed the hair from her cheek, and leaned in to take a bite. [[6277 旁白 neutral]]
A shallow row of teeth marks appeared. [[6278 旁白 neutral]]
She ate half. [[6279 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, humming a little tune, put the other half into her mouth. [[6280 旁白 neutral]]
She ate with great enjoyment. [[6281 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled, "Xiaocheng, do you really like steamed buns?" [[6282 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng gently shook her head, "Not really. This shop's soup is too much, and the taste is too strong." [[6283 池小橙 neutral]]
"Then why are you eating it with such relish? Are you hungry?" [[6284 苏桃 neutral]]
"Silly Tao Tao." Chi Xiaocheng turned around helplessly, looking at her with tender eyes, "What I've always liked is not the steamed bun, but you~" [[6285 池小橙 neutral]]
Suddenly, Su Tao was stunned. [[6286 旁白 neutral]]
A gentle breeze swept by, carrying tiny snowflakes, blowing Su Tao's hair. [[6287 旁白 neutral]]
And stirring her heart. [[6288 旁白 neutral]]
