Chapter 154: Will There Really Be a Miracle? [[13577 旁白 neutral]]
After several hours of intense rescue efforts, Su Tao's heart trembled every time the doctors went in and out. She kept fantasizing. [[13578 旁白 sad]]
What if, just what if? [[13579 苏桃 sad]]
She told herself that Xiaocheng's death was just her own judgment. The doctors were still working hard, and maybe, like last time, they could bring Xiaocheng back from the dead. [[13580 旁白 sad]]
But... [[13581 旁白 sad]]
"What do you mean you're sorry?" [[13582 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao stood before Professor Su, grabbed her collar, and shouted, breaking down, "Professor Su, what exactly do you mean by 'sorry'?!" [[13583 苏桃 angry]]
"Please don't say that, okay...?" [[13584 苏桃 sad]]
"There's still hope for Xiaocheng, right?" [[13585 苏桃 sad]]
"You're just tricking me, right? You usually like to joke around. This has to be a joke too, right?" [[13586 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's hand on the collar fell away, and her head sank weakly into Professor Su's arms. [[13587 旁白 sad]]
"Why... why couldn't you save her? Aren't you doctors? Aren't you doctors..." [[13588 苏桃 sad]]
"Ugh..." [[13589 苏桃 sad]]
Her hand grabbed the sleeve of Professor Su's clothes from behind. [[13590 旁白 sad]]
She kept pulling. [[13591 旁白 sad]]
The whimpering sound started again, but Su Tao couldn't shed any tears. [[13592 旁白 sad]]
"I'm sorry." [[13593 苏教授 sad]]
Professor Su repeated herself. She reached out and held Su Tao, trying to give the girl, who was at her limit, a bit of warmth and care. [[13594 旁白 sad]]
But to Su Tao, that embrace felt so cold. [[13595 旁白 sad]]
Only Xiaocheng's embrace was warm. [[13596 旁白 sad]]
But she was already gone! [[13597 旁白 sad]]
Her sobs and whimpers gradually faded. She hadn't had a drop of water for a long time, holding on by a thread until now. [[13598 旁白 sad]]
And when her world came crashing down, she couldn't hold on any longer. [[13599 旁白 sad]]
She collapsed in Professor Su's arms. [[13600 旁白 sad]]
Her face was still filled with pain and regret. [[13601 旁白 sad]]
Professor Su bit her lip hard, wiped a tear from the corner of her eye, and then called over a young nurse. [[13602 旁白 sad]]
"Take her to rest, and keep an eye on her condition. Let me know immediately when she wakes up, understand?" [[13603 苏教授 neutral]]
The young nurse supported Su Tao and looked at Professor Su with some concern, "Professor, you should get some rest too." [[13604 小护士 neutral]]
However, Professor Su just waved her hand, signaling for the nurse to leave first. [[13605 旁白 neutral]]
Then she sat down next to Dongfang Yang, covering her head with her hands in regret. [[13606 旁白 sad]]
Dongfang Yang felt a bitter sorrow in his heart and had the urge to cry. "Professor Su... is there really no other way?" [[13607 东方阳 sad]]
Professor Su looked up at Dongfang Yang and slowly shook her head, "Actually, when Miss Chi arrived at the hospital, she already had no signs of life. We just... we just tried our best to revive her while removing the bullet." [[13608 苏教授 sad]]
"The bullet grazed her heart. Although we managed to remove it, the power of a sniper rifle is just too great. If it were an ordinary bullet..." [[13609 苏教授 sad]]
No, there are no 'what ifs'. [[13610 旁白 sad]]
What happened has happened. Chi Xiaocheng's heart was confirmed to have stopped, and the possibility of apparent death from shock was ruled out. [[13611 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su bit her lip, "As a doctor, I shouldn't say anything that isn't precise, but if she has any chance of waking up, it would have to be a miracle." [[13612 苏教授 sad]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Professor Su, confused, "Her heart has been confirmed to have stopped. What kind of miracle could bring someone back from the dead?" [[13613 东方阳 neutral]]
This wasn't a fantasy world, and there was no magic. [[13614 旁白 neutral]]
Nor were there any celestial beings who could refine life with a single touch. [[13615 旁白 neutral]]
As a young master, Dongfang Yang had access to things ordinary people didn't, like martial arts masters from certain families who reached the limits of human ability. [[13616 旁白 neutral]]
At their peak, they could perform some light-footwork martial arts and dodge a bullet. That's it. [[13617 旁白 neutral]]
There was nothing like the fantasy and cultivation found in novels. [[13618 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su gathered a bit of energy and explained to Dongfang Yang, "I've told you before, Miss Chi's cells are much more active than a normal person's. This is actually a very unusual phenomenon." [[13619 苏教授 neutral]]
"And now, Miss Chi's heart has stopped beating, many of her neurons are damaged, and her life force is gone, but the cells in her body are still active." [[13620 苏教授 neutral]]
Professor Su clenched her fists tightly, "If, and I mean if, those cells can remain active and repair Miss Chi's body on their own, then maybe... maybe when a miracle happens, she really could wake up?" [[13621 苏教授 sad]]
She was a doctor; she shouldn't be thinking this way. [[13622 旁白 neutral]]
But when a person is truly desperate, they'll desperately cling to any faint, even unreachable, hope, won't they? [[13623 旁白 neutral]]
After hearing this, Dongfang Yang was silent for a long time. [[13624 旁白 neutral]]
Reason told him that such a miracle was impossible. [[13625 旁白 neutral]]
But his emotions made him feel a glimmer of hope. [[13626 旁白 sad]]
Professor Su looked in the direction the nurse had taken Su Tao and forced herself to be rational, suppressing her emotions. "Actually, the more important thing right now is Miss Su." [[13627 苏教授 neutral]]
"Just now, her condition was very bad. She was emotionally out of control and on the verge of collapse. Do you know what I'm most afraid of?" [[13628 苏教授 sad]]
"I'm afraid she'll lose the will to live." [[13629 苏教授 sad]]
The dead cannot be brought back to life. [[13630 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was truly gone. [[13631 旁白 sad]]
But the problems she left behind were something Professor Su had to take seriously. [[13632 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao herself was the most difficult problem to solve. [[13633 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, Dongfang Yang would have argued with Professor Su, saying that Su Tao was strong and wouldn't harm herself so easily. [[13634 旁白 neutral]]
But when he remembered the scene at Chi Xiaocheng's house, Dongfang Yang hesitated. [[13635 旁白 sad]]
The small girl lay in Su Tao's arms, and the girl who couldn't accept reality even asked if Chi Xiaocheng was really asleep. [[13636 旁白 sad]]
She was already dead, so how could she be sleeping? [[13637 旁白 sad]]
Last time was just luck, but this time was different. [[13638 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao wasn't normal at that moment. [[13639 旁白 sad]]
Her body couldn't take it, and her mind was also having problems. [[13640 旁白 sad]]
He turned to ask, "Professor, do you have any ideas?" [[13641 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su said slowly, "It would be best to find a new source of emotional support for Miss Su during her treatment and recovery, so I was thinking, maybe that miracle could work." [[13642 苏教授 neutral]]
"A miracle?" [[13643 东方阳 neutral]]
"Yes." Professor Su nodded. "We can create a lie to make her believe that Miss Chi still has a chance to live, even if that chance is infinitely close to zero." [[13644 苏教授 neutral]]
"With that hope, she won't give up easily. After that, we just have to let time heal everything." [[13645 苏教授 neutral]]
Or perhaps, it wasn't really a lie. [[13646 旁白 neutral]]
Because a miracle is something that is infinitely close to zero but still has a tiny spark of possibility. [[13647 旁白 neutral]]
However, after thinking it over, Dongfang Yang's face showed a hint of reluctance. "Wouldn't that... be too cruel to Su Tao?" [[13648 东方阳 sad]]
She had already gone through such pain once. [[13649 旁白 sad]]
It was already impossible. [[13650 旁白 sad]]
Yet they still had to weave a lie for her. [[13651 旁白 sad]]
What if the lie is exposed one day? Even if she has recovered a lot, wouldn't she have to go through this pain all over again? [[13652 旁白 sad]]
He couldn't help but look at Professor Su. "Is there any other way? She... she's already suffered enough. I'd rather she be happy in the future, not live in a mental prison because of a lie." [[13653 东方阳 sad]]
