Chapter 204: Xiaocheng: Don't Sleep Too Soundly Tonight [[17854 池小橙 neutral]]
However, his words no longer maintained his gentlemanly facade. [[17855 旁白 neutral]]
The fear and pain he had experienced made him anxious. [[17856 旁白 neutral]]
He subconsciously began to show his true nature, with a hint of threat in his words. [[17857 旁白 neutral]]
It sounded very harsh. [[17858 旁白 neutral]]
This didn't seem like someone trying to find out about the owner and manufacturer because they liked a doll. [[17859 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao didn't know about the conflict between Chu Lingfeng and Chi Xiaocheng, so even though his words were harsh, [[17860 旁白 neutral]]
she didn't immediately talk back, considering that this miracle doctor might be able to cure Chi Xiaocheng. [[17861 旁白 neutral]]
But Si Chen was different; he believed he knew Chi Xiaocheng like the back of his hand. [[17862 旁白 neutral]]
This man, who knew her activation code, was sure that Chi Xiaocheng would eventually wake up and come back on her own. [[17863 旁白 neutral]]
A miracle doctor? [[17864 司辰 neutral]]
Do we need you? [[17865 司辰 neutral]]
It was the perfect opportunity to earn brownie points, since the doll controlled by Chi Xiaocheng could see what was happening here! [[17866 旁白 happy]]
He immediately stepped forward, standing in front of Su Tao. At 1.9 meters tall, he was like a mountain, and his powerful aura made Chu Lingfeng involuntarily take a step back. [[17867 旁白 neutral]]
"What are you doing?" [[17868 楚凌风 angry]]
Chu Lingfeng's tone was a little weak. [[17869 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen retorted bluntly, "Who do you think you are? If you're asking for a favor, act like it. You think you deserve respect? Are you that special?" [[17870 司辰 angry]]
Chu Lingfeng looked at Si Chen in astonishment, pointing at himself with his thumb. "You don't know who I am?" [[17871 楚凌风 angry]]
He sneered contemptuously, "And who are you, you little punk? Is there anyone at this banquet who doesn't know me? Go ask anyone. I'm Chu Lingfeng, the miracle doctor personally invited by the Si family!" [[17872 楚凌风 angry]]
"I don't need to tell you how influential the Si family is in Jiuzhou City. After the Ye family fell, the Si family became the second-largest family in the city!" [[17873 楚凌风 angry]]
His words were full of arrogant disdain. [[17874 旁白 neutral]]
After speaking, he stared intently at Si Chen. [[17875 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to see a shocked expression on his face. [[17876 旁白 neutral]]
He had even imagined the scene that would follow. [[17877 旁白 neutral]]
—Si Chen would step back, look at him in shock, and think to himself: This person is the famous miracle doctor of the Si family! [[17878 旁白 neutral]]
After the shock, he would feel shame and humiliation, then lower his head to apologize and beg for forgiveness. [[17879 旁白 neutral]]
Then, just like before, he could show off, check the guy's pulse, point out some chronic illness, not only humiliating him but also earning major points with Miss Su Tao. [[17880 旁白 neutral]]
It was a script practically tailor-made for him. [[17881 旁白 neutral]]
However, he waited for a while but didn't see a shocked expression on Si Chen's face. [[17882 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, Si Chen waved to someone in the distance. [[17883 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Chu Lingfeng saw Si Lai, the third young master of the Si family, jogging over. "Second Brother, what did you need me for?" [[17884 司赖 happy]]
"Second Brother?" [[17885 楚凌风 sad]]
Chu Lingfeng's pupils contracted as he looked at Si Chen in shock. [[17886 旁白 neutral]]
This person was actually the recently famous second son of the Si family! [[17887 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, he was just an outsider attached to the Si family. Even if he was confident he could surpass them in the future, right now, Chu Lingfeng still needed their support. [[17888 旁白 neutral]]
And now, he had just insulted the second son of the Si family to his face. [[17889 旁白 neutral]]
Embarrassment and shame washed over him. Just as Chu Lingfeng was thinking about how to apologize and save face, he heard Si Chen say to his brother, "Haven't you been annoyed with this Chu Lingfeng for a long time? Go slap him." [[17890 司辰 neutral]]
Si Lai's eyes widened, but he looked eager. "Second Brother, that's... not a good idea, is it? He was invited by the elders. Slapping him would be disrespectful to them." [[17891 司赖 neutral]]
Si Chen pushed up his glasses and easily persuaded his naive brother, "Si Lai, you don't really think our older brother put you in charge of the Si family in Jiuzhou City for your own good, do you? Think about why I was kicked out of the capital. His goal is to keep you away from the core circle in the capital." [[17892 司辰 neutral]]
"Now that you're here, aren't all the family affairs controlled by the elders? You're constantly being pushed aside. They didn't even consult you before inviting this so-called miracle doctor." [[17893 司辰 neutral]]
"If you keep being so hesitant and cowardly, how can you even think about competing with our older brother for the inheritance?" [[17894 司辰 angry]]
Hearing this, Si Lai's expression changed drastically. [[17895 旁白 neutral]]
He immediately looked at Chu Lingfeng with resentment. [[17896 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng's face paled. He quickly explained, "Second Young Master Si, it's... I was blind and didn't recognize you. We're all on the Si family's side, on the same team. There's no need to be so extreme, right?" [[17897 楚凌风 sad]]
When Si Lai heard that, he couldn't hold back anymore. "Who's on the same team as you? You're just a dog of our Si family. You think you deserve a seat at the table?" [[17898 司赖 angry]]
He looked at Si Chen. "Second Brother, can I slap him twice?" [[17899 司赖 happy]]
Si Chen patted his shoulder, saying everything without a word. [[17900 旁白 neutral]]
He turned around, not even waiting for Chu Lingfeng's explanation, and said to Su Tao, "Let's go. It's about to get violent. Girls shouldn't watch." [[17901 司辰 neutral]]
"But..." [[17902 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao was at a loss for words but followed Si Chen away. [[17903 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, screams came from behind them. In the distance, they could even hear Si Lai excitedly shouting at the security guards, "What are you standing around for? Come and hit him with me!" [[17904 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't help but shiver. "Si Chen, will your brother really be okay? If Doctor Chu is a guest, won't he get in trouble?" [[17905 苏桃 sad]]
Si Chen shrugged. "So what if he gets told off? It has nothing to do with me. Anyway, I really don't like that Chu Lingfeng. You should stay away from him." [[17906 司辰 neutral]]
"But, he's a miracle doctor. He might have a chance to save Xiaocheng, right?" [[17907 苏桃 sad]]
Si Chen stopped in his tracks. [[17908 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't know how to explain it. [[17909 旁白 neutral]]
He thought for a moment and said slowly, "Dongfang Yang and I will handle this. Don't worry." [[17910 司辰 neutral]]
"Thank you." [[17911 苏桃 happy]]
The two re-entered the banquet hall. Perhaps due to her main character aura, combined with her faint, melancholic air, Su Tao attracted many young masters who were there looking for romance. [[17912 旁白 neutral]]
But as soon as they approached to talk to her, Si Chen blocked them. [[17913 旁白 neutral]]
Until they met Dongfang Yang. [[17914 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen said, "I'll leave it to you to take Su Tao home. I have some personal family matters to attend to. Contact me if anything comes up." [[17915 司辰 neutral]]
"No problem." [[17916 东方阳 neutral]]
Watching Dongfang Yang leave with Su Tao, Si Chen was about to turn when he noticed a small piece of paper fall from Su Tao. [[17917 旁白 neutral]]
He was about to call out to Su Tao. [[17918 旁白 neutral]]
When he noticed a small orange pattern on the note. [[17919 旁白 neutral]]
It was left by the high-tech doll controlled by Chi Xiaocheng! [[17920 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen calmly picked up the note. After moving to a secluded spot, he took a deep breath. "This must be about her future plans. I knew Chi Xiaocheng wouldn't stay silent after faking her death for so long." [[17921 司辰 neutral]]
"Looks like Su Tao is about to fall completely." [[17922 司辰 neutral]]
He opened the note and was stunned. [[17923 旁白 neutral]]
—Si Chen, don't sleep too soundly tonight. I'll come find you in your dreams. [[17924 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "???" [[17925 司辰 sad]]
Oh no, it's for me. [[17926 司辰 sad]]
Could it be that she wants to meet and discuss things with me? [[17927 司辰 neutral]]
But why did she say she'd find me in my dreams? Has technology advanced so much that people can freely enter others' dreams? I'm from a major family, how come I don't know about this! [[17928 司辰 sad]]
Or maybe... Chi Xiaocheng is actually here for revenge! [[17929 司辰 sad]]
After all, last time at the hospital, I said I wanted to marry Su Tao. [[17930 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen lit a cigarette and fell into deep thought. [[17931 旁白 neutral]]
Then, he couldn't sleep that night. [[17932 旁白 neutral]]
He tossed and turned, not daring to sleep. The slightest sound made his heart race. [[17933 旁白 sad]]
He never would have guessed that the note was just a decoy left by Chi Xiaocheng. [[17934 旁白 neutral]]
The purpose... [[17935 旁白 neutral]]
