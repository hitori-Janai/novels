Chapter 197: There's a Ghost! [[17250 旁白 neutral]]
Arriving even earlier than Chu Lingfeng was Si Lai, Si Chen's younger brother, who was supposed to be welcoming guests with him but was ignored by everyone. [[17251 旁白 neutral]]
This younger brother was a bit chubby, with a look of foolishness and humor on his face that made him seem simple and honest. [[17252 旁白 neutral]]
But when he got closer, a look of hatred crossed Si Lai's honest face. "Second Brother, that guy Chu Lingfeng is completely shameless. I was supposed to be the one greeting the guests to get some recognition." [[17253 司赖 angry]]
"But he stole my spotlight! This is our clan uncle's birthday banquet. Anyone who didn't know would think it was being held for him!" [[17254 司赖 angry]]
With a wronged expression, he looked just like a primary school student complaining to his parents. [[17255 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen pulled the little fatty aside and gave Dongfang Yang a meaningful look. [[17256 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang nodded slightly; he understood what Si Chen meant. [[17257 旁白 neutral]]
Family matters came first, so the "miracle doctor" would be left to him for now. [[17258 旁白 neutral]]
The three of them continued towards the villa's main entrance, while Chu Lingfeng also broke away from the guests, having waited for some time. "Young Master Dongfang, I've heard so much about you and have always wanted to meet. It's a shame I've been in Jiuzhou City for two months without an opportunity." [[17259 楚凌风 neutral]]
He offered a warm smile and introduced himself, "We may not have met, but you've probably heard of me. My name is Chu Lingfeng, but most people call me Miracle Doctor Chu, though that's just a title." [[17260 楚凌风 happy]]
Despite his words, the word "arrogant" was practically written all over his face. [[17261 旁白 neutral]]
Without some real skill, it would be impossible to fake such arrogance, unless one had intermediate acting skills like Chi Xiaocheng. [[17262 旁白 neutral]]
The words "miracle doctor" immediately made Su Tao think of Chi Xiaocheng, who was still lying in a hospital bed, and she felt a surge of anxiety. [[17263 旁白 neutral]]
She was about to step forward and say something when Qian Qing, who was beside her, tugged her sleeve. [[17264 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did she calm down. [[17265 旁白 neutral]]
Her body, which had been leaning forward, returned to its normal, elegant posture. [[17266 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was in front, his hands in his pockets, his attitude reasonably friendly. "I've also heard great things about Miracle Doctor Chu. Why wait for another day? Isn't this the perfect time to get acquainted?" [[17267 东方阳 neutral]]
Perhaps because of Dongfang Yang's attitude, Chu Lingfeng was pleasantly surprised and a bit carried away. "Haha, you're right, Brother Dongfang. If I didn't still have to greet guests, I'd go inside and have a couple of drinks with you right now." [[17268 楚凌风 happy]]
"There will be a chance later. You don't need to see my invitation, do you?" [[17269 东方阳 neutral]]
"Of course not." Chu Lingfeng pretended to adjust his tie and looked first at Qian Qing. "And you two are...?" [[17270 楚凌风 neutral]]
"Qian Qing, Dongfang Yang's date." [[17271 钱清 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng's face lit up with recognition. "Ah, so you are Miss Qian. Your father invited me for dinner some time ago, but unfortunately, you weren't home." [[17272 楚凌风 neutral]]
After the pleasantries, he turned to Su Tao and extended a hand. "And this young lady is...?" [[17273 楚凌风 neutral]]
He left his sentence unfinished, but his outstretched hand was clearly waiting for Su Tao to shake it. [[17274 旁白 neutral]]
And his gaze, pretending to be proper, was continuously scanning Su Tao's beautiful face. [[17275 旁白 neutral]]
Acknowledging Qian Qing was just a formality and a pretense. [[17276 旁白 neutral]]
With his sharp eyes, Chu Lingfeng could tell at a glance that the modestly dressed girl behind them, who seemed to be protected, was the real prize. [[17277 旁白 neutral]]
However, this gesture of extending his hand was somewhat forward. [[17278 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't offered his hand to Dongfang Yang or Qian Qing, only to Su Tao. [[17279 旁白 neutral]]
His intentions were as clear as day. [[17280 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang, who had a decent impression of him until now, frowned imperceptibly. [[17281 旁白 neutral]]
Then he reached out and shook Chu Lingfeng's hand, smiling. "She is my younger sister, Su Tao. I brought her here to see the world. She's a bit shy." [[17282 东方阳 neutral]]
"I see." Chu Lingfeng reacted quickly and apologized, "My apologies, I was being too forward. Please, go on in. After I'm done greeting the guests, I'll be sure to get to know you better, Brother Dongfang." [[17283 楚凌风 neutral]]
"Alright, I'll be waiting inside for you, Miracle Doctor Chu. I happen to have something I'd like to discuss with you." [[17284 东方阳 neutral]]
"No problem." [[17285 楚凌风 happy]]
After the brief chat, they parted ways. [[17286 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng turned to watch Su Tao's departing figure, his eyes filled with a hint of possessiveness and fascination. [[17287 旁白 neutral]]
However, as he watched, he suddenly felt a chill down his spine. [[17288 旁白 neutral]]
A gust of wind blew, lifting Su Tao's hair and the hem of her dress. [[17289 旁白 neutral]]
It also blew the small doll tied to her waist to the other side. [[17290 旁白 neutral]]
Its glowing red eyes stared motionlessly at Chu Lingfeng. [[17291 旁白 neutral]]
The young man shivered. "This little doll... it looks a bit creepy. Is Miss Su Tao into this kind of thing?" [[17292 楚凌风 neutral]]
He didn't think much of it and continued to welcome the incoming guests. [[17293 旁白 neutral]]
After Su Tao and the others went inside, she and Qian Qing began to move about freely. [[17294 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang also needed to socialize and couldn't look after them the whole time. [[17295 旁白 neutral]]
Although there were many women present, very few were dressed as flamboyantly as Qian Qing. [[17296 旁白 neutral]]
She attracted the attention of many men. [[17297 旁白 neutral]]
And a girl without a male companion was a signal to certain people. [[17298 旁白 neutral]]
As a result, a constant stream of men came up to talk to her. [[17299 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was a little uncomfortable with this scene, and Qian Qing noticed, using Dongfang Yang's name to fend off all the admirers. [[17300 旁白 neutral]]
This continued until someone related to the Qian family approached them. [[17301 旁白 neutral]]
As the eldest daughter of the Qian family, she inevitably had to chat with them for a bit. [[17302 旁白 neutral]]
When the clouds covering the moon drifted away, [[17303 旁白 neutral]]
the moonlight was able to shine everywhere. [[17304 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had crammed some knowledge about banquets, so even when she was alone, she didn't seem too nervous. But sitting alone in a corner, she was still impossible to ignore. [[17305 旁白 neutral]]
Some people were here specifically to "hunt for beauties." [[17306 旁白 neutral]]
A young man with a buzz cut, wearing a suit, walked towards Su Tao with two glasses of red wine. [[17307 旁白 neutral]]
He offered one with a gentlemanly gesture. "Miss, are you alone? Would you do me the honor of sharing a drink?" [[17308 陌生男1 neutral]]
Su Tao offered a polite smile. "I'm sorry, I have a companion, but she's just not with me at the moment." [[17309 苏桃 neutral]]
The man had been observing from the side for a long time. If Su Tao had a companion, they should have come over by now. [[17310 旁白 neutral]]
He sneered inwardly and pushed the glass of red wine closer, refusing to give up. [[17311 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, if your companion isn't here, you need someone to protect you. Or we could just chat, so you won't be bothered by other men." [[17312 陌生男1 neutral]]
As he spoke, he lowered his head, intending to admire the girl's figure from top to bottom. [[17313 旁白 neutral]]
But as soon as he moved his head, [[17314 旁白 neutral]]
he met the gaze of the doll at Su Tao's waist. [[17315 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't just the frightening, blood-red eyes; the man clearly saw the scarecrow doll move! [[17316 旁白 neutral]]
It had been expressionless before. [[17317 旁白 neutral]]
But when it faced him, it... it was smiling! [[17318 旁白 neutral]]
The man swallowed hard, his hand holding the wine glass frozen in mid-air. He rubbed his eyes with his other hand. [[17319 旁白 neutral]]
"Is... is it my imagination?" [[17320 陌生男1 sad]]
He opened his eyes and looked at the scarecrow again. [[17321 旁白 neutral]]
And now, the scarecrow's expression had changed from a smile to one of intense hatred! [[17322 旁白 neutral]]
Its hands were slowly rising, as if it was about to pounce. [[17323 旁白 neutral]]
The man no longer had any desire to flirt. [[17324 旁白 neutral]]
His hand trembled, and he lost his grip on the wine glass. [[17325 旁白 neutral]]
It fell to the floor with a crash. [[17326 旁白 neutral]]
If Su Tao hadn't moved away in time, the wine would have splashed onto her gown. [[17327 旁白 neutral]]
However, what caught the attention of the other guests was the man's terrified reaction. [[17328 旁白 neutral]]
He fell to the ground in a pathetic heap, muttering two words over and over. [[17329 旁白 neutral]]
"There's a ghost!" [[17330 陌生男1 sad]]
