Chapter 43 Whitewashing Weakens by Three Points, Blackening Strengthens Tenfold [[3661 旁白 neutral]]
Dare she? [[3662 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sat blankly on the stone bench, one hand on the stone table, her fingertips feeling a chill. [[3663 旁白 neutral]]
The sun was warm and the sky was cloudless. [[3664 旁白 neutral]]
Yet she felt as if she had fallen into an ice cellar. [[3665 旁白 neutral]]
Try. [[3666 旁白 neutral]]
Just these two words made Su Tao imagine several scenarios of Chi Xiaocheng's yandere transformation. [[3667 旁白 neutral]]
She said worriedly to Si Chen, "Last time, because Ye Liang took me to a cruise banquet, I had to pretend to be his girlfriend to support him at the banquet. After Xiaocheng found out about this..." [[3668 苏桃 sad]]
"She vaguely showed suicidal tendencies." [[3669 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao recalled the scene on the rooftop. [[3670 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng hugged her, tears and rain mixing, falling onto her dress. [[3671 旁白 neutral]]
She cried and blamed herself, saying in fear—the 14th floor is too high, I don't dare. [[3672 池小橙 sad]]
She was unharmed, but her phone had fallen downstairs and shattered. [[3673 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao even imagined Chi Xiaocheng standing on the edge of the rooftop. [[3674 旁白 neutral]]
Trembling, urging herself to jump, her survival instinct struggling. [[3675 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't know what happened during the process, or what kind of psychological struggle Chi Xiaocheng went through. [[3676 旁白 neutral]]
But that shattered phone seemed to display the ending of "Chi Xiaocheng" in another timeline. [[3677 旁白 neutral]]
Both fortunate. [[3678 旁白 neutral]]
And afraid. [[3679 旁白 neutral]]
This was how Su Tao felt at the time. [[3680 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, recalling those scenes, she occasionally trembled uncontrollably. [[3681 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen sighed beside her, "So, you don't dare?" [[3682 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and nodded, "I'm afraid she'll become extreme again." [[3683 苏桃 sad]]
"That's why I said you're avoiding it, you're afraid." Si Chen took off his glasses and gently wiped the lenses with a cloth, "According to your thoughts, if Chi Xiaocheng isn't a yandere, then no matter how extreme she gets, she won't threaten her own life." [[3684 司辰 neutral]]
"If she really died, you wouldn't see her again." [[3685 司辰 neutral]]
"As for self-harm, I can't say for sure." [[3686 司辰 neutral]]
Saying that, he snapped his fingers, "Then let's use the second method. I'll go and test her for you." [[3687 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up, "Test?" [[3688 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes." Si Chen nodded, "I'll pretend to be your love rival in front of Chi Xiaocheng and directly tell her that I'm going to take you away and bring you back to the capital." [[3689 司辰 neutral]]
"After all, you keep saying she's a yandere, but I've heard it but never seen it. With close contact, I can observe her expressions, movements, and demeanor, and basically come to a conclusion." [[3690 司辰 neutral]]
Even the best acting can't fake micro-expression changes, right? [[3691 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips, hesitating, "Will there be any danger?" [[3692 苏桃 neutral]]
"She's a 1.5-meter tall girl. What kind of danger do you think she can bring me?" [[3693 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen was 1.9 meters tall. [[3694 旁白 neutral]]
A 40-centimeter height difference, how could he lose? [[3695 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had no other choice. Her mind was in a mess, and she could only agree to Si Chen's proposal for now. [[3696 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone again, lost in thought. [[3697 旁白 neutral]]
Should she ask Doctor Cheng again? [[3698 旁白 neutral]]
She clicked into the chat page with Chi Song, and that question was still there, waiting for her answer—Xiao Tao, do you like my sister? [[3699 旁白 neutral]]
Her heart was filled with countless emotions, but none of them were love. [[3700 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao exhaled, intending to answer truthfully. [[3701 旁白 neutral]]
But at this moment, Si Chen suddenly spoke from beside her, "It's snowing." [[3702 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up in surprise, finding that the sun had been covered by clouds at some point, and fine silver flakes were falling from the sky. [[3703 旁白 neutral]]
"The first snow in Jiuzhou City, it's a bit late." [[3704 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao exhaled a warm breath, and lowered her head to send the few words in the chat box. [[3705 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, Brother Chi Song, I've always treated Xiaocheng like a sister." [[3706 苏桃 neutral]]
A gust of wind came, blowing snowflakes onto Su Tao. [[3707 旁白 neutral]]
She shivered, her hair swaying. [[3708 旁白 neutral]]
"So cold." [[3709 苏桃 sad]]
Inside the cafe, Chi Xiaocheng received a transfer from her brother. [[3710 旁白 neutral]]
2145 soft currency. [[3711 旁白 neutral]]
Coupled with the system notification that just sounded. [[3712 旁白 neutral]]
[Supporting character Chi Song is experiencing happiness because of the host.] [[3713 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion points +12] [[3714 系统 neutral]]
The precise non-integer change, feeling happy because of her sister's smile, Chi Xiaocheng could be sure that these two thousand yuan were probably all her brother had. [[3715 旁白 neutral]]
"That's really good." Chi Xiaocheng sighed, feeling the money burning a hole in her hand. [[3716 旁白 neutral]]
The original owner was gone, and she didn't have much affection for this brother. She had never experienced such selfless care as an orphan in her previous life. [[3717 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was not heartless. [[3718 旁白 neutral]]
Only by changing her cannon fodder bad ending could she save herself, save Su Tao, and fulfill Chi Song and her family! [[3719 旁白 neutral]]
"System, how many emotion points do I have now?" [[3720 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes became determined. [[3721 旁白 neutral]]
[Replying to host, 1236 points.] [[3722 系统 neutral]]
"One ten-pull!" [[3723 池小橙 neutral]]
She was still too weak now, and most of the time she was very passive. [[3724 旁白 neutral]]
The weak and pitiful persona was only useful to some people. If she encountered an accident, she would still be very dangerous. [[3725 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng desperately wanted to improve herself. [[3726 旁白 neutral]]
With a wave of her small hand, she flipped over all ten cards. [[3727 旁白 neutral]]
And this time, to Chi Xiaocheng's delight, one of the ten cards glowed orange-red. [[3728 旁白 neutral]]
This was... a high-level skill! [[3729 旁白 neutral]]
[Host drawing cards...] [[3730 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained Hacker Toolset *1 (common hacking and protection tools for hackers)] [[3731 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained Nutritious Pickled Cabbage Beef Noodles *3 (total 3 boxes, 10 packs per box, contains trace nutrients, no side effects on the body, note: pickled cabbage is stepped on by a white-haired beautiful girl)] [[3732 系统 neutral]]
[Soft Bone Powder *4 (ingestion can make bones soft, body weak and unable to resist, lasts for half an hour)] [[3733 系统 neutral]]
[Congratulations to host for obtaining active skill: Pseudovoice (Beginner)] [[3734 系统 neutral]]
[Pseudovoice (Beginner): Host can actively learn and change into others' voices, regardless of gender.] [[3735 系统 neutral]]
[Congratulations to host for obtaining passive skill: Blackening (Advanced)] [[3736 系统 neutral]]
[Blackening (Advanced): As the saying goes, whitewashing weakens by three points, blackening strengthens tenfold. The host will blacken when angry. Depending on the host's level of anger, combat power will increase by 3-10 times. The angrier, the higher the combat power increase.] [[3737 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes became strange. [[3738 旁白 neutral]]
After drawing cards a few times, she understood that the items given by the system were just accessories, and the real main prize was the skills. [[3739 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't even mention Pseudovoice. For her current situation, she could think of very few uses for it. [[3740 旁白 neutral]]
The advanced Blackening skill could increase her combat power, which was great, but why was it a passive skill?! [[3741 旁白 neutral]]
"Do I have to be furious to become powerful?" [[3742 池小橙 neutral]]
[That's not it, Host.] [[3743 系统 neutral]]
The system explained. [[3744 旁白 neutral]]
[If you genuinely dislike someone, or if you're smiling but suppressing anger in your heart, you're also in an angry state. The minimum increase is 3 times. If you're consumed by anger, you'll reach 10 times combat power.] [[3745 系统 neutral]]
Now Chi Xiaocheng understood. Her basic physical abilities were the most important. [[3746 旁白 neutral]]
The stronger she was, the stronger she would become after the amplification. [[3747 旁白 neutral]]
"I still feel like it's not very useful." [[3748 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed inwardly. She felt that she was very rational, and being consumed by anger was unlikely to happen to her. [[3749 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's think about how to make money." [[3750 旁白 neutral]]
With a "ding-dong," her phone suddenly rang. [[3751 旁白 neutral]]
It was her alternate account as Doctor Cheng. [[3752 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes flickered, and she looked at the message from Su Tao in surprise. [[3753 旁白 neutral]]
"Doctor Cheng, do you think a yandere would know they're a yandere?" [[3754 苏桃 neutral]]
