Chapter 21: Heaven is Knocking at the Door [[1850 旁白 neutral]]
    Drip~ Drip~ [[1851 旁白 neutral]]
    The rain gradually lessened. Dongfang Yang closed his umbrella, shook off the raindrops from his body, and rushed into the girls' dormitory. [[1852 旁白 neutral]]
    Fortunately, there was a power outage at the time, so he moved quickly and no one noticed him. [[1853 旁白 neutral]]
    After being stuck in traffic for half an hour and receiving a phone call from Su Tao, he finally arrived here. [[1854 旁白 neutral]]
    His mood was as gloomy as the dark clouds above. He knew something very serious had happened tonight. [[1855 旁白 neutral]]
    It was also the first time he had seen Su Tao so anxious. [[1856 旁白 neutral]]
    But the person making her anxious wasn't him! [[1857 旁白 angry]]
    Moreover, he still didn't know what exactly had happened. He had just been used as a tool all evening. [[1858 旁白 angry]]
    First, he had to watch Ye Liang show off. When he finally had a chance to make his presence known, he got stuck in traffic and couldn't even help Su Tao. When he finally reached the school, Su Tao called asking him to go to the girls' dormitory to help? [[1859 旁白 angry]]
    And he was helping Chi Xiaocheng! [[1860 旁白 angry]]
    He felt like he was just a tool. [[1861 旁白 sad]]
    This made Dongfang Yang strangely jealous. [[1862 旁白 neutral]]
    Even though the target of his jealousy, Chi Xiaocheng, was a girl. [[1863 旁白 neutral]]
    "But after tonight, Su Tao will definitely have much better feelings toward me, right?" [[1864 东方阳 happy]]
    Dongfang Yang climbed the stairs, thinking with anticipation. [[1865 旁白 neutral]]
    Then he reached the rooftop. [[1866 旁白 neutral]]
    Without even opening his umbrella, he hurriedly searched for Su Tao's figure. [[1867 旁白 neutral]]
    Then his smile froze. [[1868 旁白 neutral]]
    Under the rain shelter, he saw two beautiful girls huddled together. [[1869 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao was holding Chi Xiaocheng, who was curled up in a ball, in her arms. As if afraid she might catch cold, Su Tao was doing her best to wrap her arms around the petite girl, actively exposing half of her own body to the rain to help shield Chi Xiaocheng from the raindrops blown in by the wind. [[1870 旁白 neutral]]
    Both seemed to have fallen asleep from exhaustion, and the water droplets had made their hair stick together. [[1871 旁白 neutral]]
    Watching the two beautiful girls cuddling together, Dongfang Yang had to admit. [[1872 旁白 neutral]]
    He was bitter with jealousy. [[1873 旁白 angry]]
    This kind of romantic drama scene should be between the male lead and female lead, right? What gave Chi Xiaocheng the right? [[1874 旁白 angry]]
    Did I get the wrong script? [[1875 旁白 angry]]
    Though his heart was in turmoil, Dongfang Yang quickly woke Su Tao up. "Su Tao, wake up. Don't sleep here, you'll catch cold!" [[1876 东方阳 neutral]]
    Being tapped on the shoulder, Su Tao suddenly woke up. [[1877 旁白 neutral]]
    Instinctively, she shouted, "Xiaocheng!" [[1878 苏桃 sad]]
    Feeling the burning softness in her arms, Su Tao felt much more at ease. "She's still here, that's good." [[1879 苏桃 neutral]]
    This scene made Dongfang Yang's expression even uglier. [[1880 旁白 angry]]
    He was so jealous his face was twisted! [[1881 旁白 angry]]
    He had been pursuing Su Tao for three months and hadn't even held her hand! [[1882 旁白 angry]]
    Fortunately, the darkness hid his expression. [[1883 旁白 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang took a deep breath, calmed his emotions, and comforted himself that Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao had a good relationship as best friends, so being close was nothing unusual. [[1884 旁白 neutral]]
    Girls, after all - this was normal. [[1885 旁白 neutral]]
    He reached out and pulled Su Tao to her feet. "Come on, let's go down first." [[1886 东方阳 neutral]]
    "Mm." Su Tao leaned against the wall and looked at Chi Xiaocheng. "My legs are a bit numb. Could you help me?" [[1887 苏桃 neutral]]
    "No problem." [[1888 东方阳 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang crouched down and was about to pick up Chi Xiaocheng, but when he saw colors on the ground that were different from the clear rainwater, his eyes widened. [[1889 旁白 neutral]]
    "What is this?" [[1890 东方阳 neutral]]
    He asked in confusion, and immediately noticed there were many marks on Chi Xiaocheng's hands. [[1891 旁白 neutral]]
    He had no idea how such marks had gotten there. [[1892 旁白 neutral]]
    Had she bumped into something, or had someone hurt her? [[1893 旁白 neutral]]
    He took a deep breath and looked at Su Tao. "Is this what you meant by life-threatening danger? She wanted to leave this world forever?" [[1894 东方阳 sad]]
    Su Tao was silent for a moment. "Let's take Xiaocheng to the hospital first. I'll explain to you later." [[1895 苏桃 sad]]
    "Alright!" [[1896 东方阳 neutral]]
    He easily picked up Chi Xiaocheng, and the two quickly went downstairs. [[1897 旁白 neutral]]
    After getting her into the car, they both finally breathed a sigh of relief. [[1898 旁白 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang calmly started the car. "Let's go to the nearest hospital first. My private hospital is too far from here, and she has a high fever now. If we delay, something might happen." [[1899 东方阳 neutral]]
    Su Tao sat beside Chi Xiaocheng, holding her hand. "I hope there won't be traffic jams." [[1900 苏桃 neutral]]
    "If there's another traffic jam, I'll directly call for a helicopter!" [[1901 东方阳 angry]]
    Dongfang Yang said fiercely, turning on the headlights and quickly driving away from the school. [[1902 旁白 neutral]]
    Getting to the hospital would still take some time, and he couldn't help but glance at the rearview mirror. [[1903 旁白 neutral]]
    He saw Su Tao constantly using tissues to care for Chi Xiaocheng, first drying the water from her hair and neck, then wiping away the cold sweat that had appeared. [[1904 旁白 neutral]]
    Her eyes showed heartache, and her movements were gentle. [[1905 旁白 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang looked away and asked, "We'll be at the hospital in a few minutes. Now can you tell me what's going on? And how did Chi Xiaocheng get hurt?" [[1906 东方阳 neutral]]
    Su Tao paused her movements and bit her lower lip. [[1907 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng was gradually returning to normal, but that scene seemed engraved in her soul. [[1908 旁白 neutral]]
    She slowly said, "My mind is also very confused. I haven't had much contact with Xiaocheng these past two months, and I don't know what happened to her. These marks on her hands - she did them all to herself." [[1909 苏桃 sad]]
    After thinking for a long time, Su Tao still hid the fact that Chi Xiaocheng had given her gifts. [[1910 旁白 neutral]]
    She was clear about Dongfang Yang's feelings for her. [[1911 旁白 neutral]]
    Speaking of such disturbing things, she was afraid he would react as extremely as Ye Liang had. [[1912 旁白 neutral]]
    But even saying half of such things was very shocking. [[1913 旁白 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang had seen many strange things, but even so, his eyes showed some shock. "You're saying Chi Xiaocheng has always had tendencies toward self-harm?" [[1914 东方阳 sad]]
    The disturbing marks on those small, tender hands were heartbreaking to look at. [[1915 旁白 neutral]]
    Speaking of this, Dongfang Yang suddenly remembered something and said, "Wait, maybe it wasn't voluntary. Maybe she was forced." [[1916 东方阳 neutral]]
    "Forced?" Su Tao was stunned. [[1917 苏桃 neutral]]
    She knew it should have been Chi Xiaocheng's own choice, and it was for her sake. [[1918 旁白 neutral]]
    But why would Dongfang Yang come to such a conclusion? [[1919 旁白 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang explained, "Actually, yesterday I had someone investigate what happened to Chi Xiaocheng these past two months. Perhaps without your protection, she's been having a hard time these two months." [[1920 东方阳 neutral]]
    Su Tao frowned. [[1921 旁白 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang: "Setting aside her targeting you, outside of those matters, Chi Xiaocheng has actually been in a state of long-term bullying." [[1922 东方阳 neutral]]
    "Her home is near here, right? And her high school isn't far either. Although she entered university, her high school relationships never changed. Since she's a day student, when she goes home she's often blocked by delinquent girls." [[1923 东方阳 neutral]]
    "And at school, there are also several guys who got in through connections. She gets bullied at school, and then gets blocked when she goes home. Someone as foolish as her would easily develop psychological trauma." [[1924 东方阳 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang sighed. "If she was forced, it wouldn't be strange for her to harm herself." [[1925 东方阳 neutral]]
    After hearing this, Su Tao gradually fell silent. [[1926 旁白 neutral]]
    Without doubt, Dongfang Yang had found her a very good excuse. [[1927 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao was clear that Chi Xiaocheng becoming like this was largely because of herself. Before, she had just subconsciously avoided thinking about what happened in the basement, unwilling to think about it. [[1928 旁白 neutral]]
    But just now, holding Chi Xiaocheng. [[1929 旁白 neutral]]
    While waiting for Dongfang Yang to arrive under the rain shelter, feeling the fragile body in her arms gradually warming up, Su Tao also calmly recalled the words she had said in the basement. [[1930 旁白 neutral]]
    "Taotao, the one I've always liked is you!" [[1931 池小橙 sad]]
    "You always told me that I was your most precious friend, your most important person, the person you liked most!" [[1932 池小橙 sad]]
    "Since you said all that to me, why did you betray me!" [[1933 池小橙 angry]]
    Leaning against the seat, Su Tao's throat felt choked up. [[1934 旁白 sad]]
    She looked at the cloudy sky, and lightning seemed to fall along her line of sight, saying to her: [[1935 旁白 neutral]]
    You gave her hope, guided her thoughts, and when she was hopelessly in love with you, attached to you, dependent on you, you brought her despair. [[1936 旁白 neutral]]
    If that's the case, why do you still care about her? [[1937 旁白 neutral]]
    The rainwater struck the windows like heaven's hand knocking at the door, telling her to quickly open it and send Chi Xiaocheng away. [[1938 旁白 neutral]]
    The howling wind seemed to whisper in Su Tao's ear: rather than the girl beside you living through this miserable life, it would be better for her to return and end it all. [[1939 旁白 sad]]
