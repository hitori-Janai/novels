Chapter 142: The Two Who Must Change [[12505 旁白 neutral]]
No one was wrong, or perhaps, everyone had their faults. [[12506 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't want to be a substitute for the original Xiaocheng, and she was terrified by her near-death experience. She was afraid of losing Su Tao, and even more afraid that Su Tao would abandon her due to the plot and the world's will. [[12507 旁白 sad]]
Just like in her past life, she had given her all, only to be betrayed. [[12508 旁白 sad]]
Just as the dark Xiaocheng said, possessing her and holding her tightly was a comfort to herself and a protection for Su Tao. [[12509 旁白 neutral]]
When fear clouds the mind, reason fades. [[12510 旁白 neutral]]
It made Chi Xiaocheng forget that under such constant pressure, without giving Su Tao hope as before, how could she ever be loved? [[12511 旁白 sad]]
She had even closed off her own heart. [[12512 旁白 sad]]
If the plan to fake her death had succeeded, things would have been fine. Chi Xiaocheng had used a double, and everything went according to her plan. [[12513 旁白 neutral]]
But because it failed, she personally experienced the feeling of life slipping away and the person she loved drifting further and further away. [[12514 旁白 sad]]
Even knowing she had a second life, she felt scared and panicked, so she began to shut herself away and become paranoid. [[12515 旁白 sad]]
Was Su Tao wrong? [[12516 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know what others thought, but Su Tao had always felt that she was the one at fault. [[12517 旁白 sad]]
She had turned Xiaocheng into a yandere, ignoring her time and again, and pretending to like her as a form of treatment. But in the end, the results only got worse each time. [[12518 旁白 sad]]
Countless escapes, followed by countless regrets. [[12519 旁白 sad]]
But faced with those confessions of love and the terror of her yandere tendencies, her regret was overcome by fear and dread. [[12520 旁白 sad]]
Her mind went blank. [[12521 旁白 sad]]
Both of them stopped themselves from reaching out to the other. [[12522 旁白 sad]]
It wasn't just Su Tao who didn't want to see this; even Si Chen didn't want to see it. [[12523 旁白 neutral]]
He and Doctor Lin had analyzed Chi Xiaocheng's report, and it was no exaggeration to say that because of the faked death, Chi Xiaocheng herself had deviated from her own plan. [[12524 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what Su Tao said about liking her, she would think it was just an act. [[12525 旁白 neutral]]
She started to overthink things obsessively. [[12526 旁白 neutral]]
She believed that only by obeying her and doing as she said could it be considered true "love." [[12527 旁白 neutral]]
When Su Tao's "God of War" father returns, would they still be able to use him as planned? [[12528 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, Su Tao had lost all reason. The probability of her going crazy first was much higher than the probability of her falling in love with Chi Xiaocheng. [[12529 旁白 neutral]]
If neither of them changed, it would be incredibly difficult for them to be together. [[12530 旁白 sad]]
Si Chen never expected that he would not only have to be a mole and a tool, but now also a matchmaker and psychological counselor to bring these two who had lost their way together. [[12531 旁白 neutral]]
Was there still hope? [[12532 旁白 neutral]]
It was worth a try. [[12533 旁白 neutral]]
In response to Su Tao's question, Si Chen typed back, "The only solution now is for you to love her with all your heart, to make her truly feel your love, not your fake affection." [[12534 司辰 neutral]]
After receiving the message, Su Tao bit her lip. "Is it still too late? To love her with all my heart... I... I don't know how." [[12535 苏桃 sad]]
After all, what is love, and what is liking someone? [[12536 苏桃 sad]]
Could Chi Xiaocheng's constant possessiveness and paranoia be considered love? [[12537 苏桃 sad]]
Si Chen: "Whether it's too late or not is another question, but there's no other way, is there? Unless you knock her out, give her a few shots of tranquilizer, or try sending her to a mental hospital." [[12538 司辰 neutral]]
With Su Tao's superhuman strength, it was hard to say if she could win against Chi Xiaocheng in her blackened state. [[12539 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen: "It's the same as last time, force yourself to love her!" [[12540 司辰 neutral]]
"It doesn't matter if you don't know what love is, you just need to know what love looks like in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes." [[12541 司辰 neutral]]
"It's possession, it's caring so much that she's the only one you see, it can even be her everything!" [[12542 司辰 neutral]]
"In that case, just follow her way of thinking and love her. Act like you want to possess Chi Xiaocheng too, like you want a love that lasts forever. Even proactively interfere with her. What can her weak little body do? If you think of some ways to weaken her so she can't beat you, the problem will naturally be solved." [[12543 司辰 neutral]]
"Don't think about the future. The first thing to do is calm her down!" [[12544 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen had typed a lot, and just reading the content made Su Tao's heart tremble with fear. [[12545 旁白 sad]]
Me, possess Xiaocheng? [[12546 苏桃 sad]]
Go along with her, and even turn the tables? [[12547 苏桃 sad]]
What does that mean? Does he want me to become a yandere to please Xiaocheng? [[12548 苏桃 sad]]
Just as Su Tao was trying to process this with her increasingly overwhelmed brain, her phone suddenly rang. [[12549 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, who was in her room, peeked her small head out at the sound of the ringtone. [[12550 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't dare to continue chatting with Si Chen. She quickly opened WeChat and deleted the entire chat history. [[12551 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did she give a dry laugh to Chi Xiaocheng, who had walked into the living room. "It's a call from the manager at my part-time job." [[12552 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng just smiled faintly. "Go on, answer it. I already said I won't interfere when Tao Tao is relaxing on her phone." [[12553 池小橙 happy]]
She sat down next to her, looking at Su Tao from the side. [[12554 旁白 neutral]]
She was smiling, as if she wanted to know what the call was about. [[12555 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had no choice but to answer the phone, bracing herself. "Hello, Manager Long, what's up?" [[12556 苏桃 neutral]]
Although she called her "Manager," the voice on the phone was a sharp, middle-aged woman's voice, shouting at Su Tao, "Su Tao, you didn't come to work! Where did you run off to? Do you even want this job anymore?!" [[12557 隆姐 angry]]
Su Tao's face turned pale, and she quickly explained, "Manager Long, I took three days off. Manager Feng approved it." [[12558 苏桃 sad]]
"Feng is nothing! I'm in charge of this store! How many workdays are in a month? What do you mean by taking leave all the time? If you don't want to work, then get out! If you don't come back, you can forget about last month's and this month's salary!" [[12559 隆姐 angry]]
"Manager Long, I..." [[12560 苏桃 sad]]
"Beep, beep, beep—" [[12561 旁白 neutral]]
The call had been disconnected. [[12562 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao leaned back on the sofa, staring blankly at the ceiling. [[12563 旁白 sad]]
The snack supermarket where she worked was actually quite nice. The shifts were usually half a day or an evening, and the main boss was very kind and took care of the part-time students. [[12564 旁白 neutral]]
As long as you showed up, didn't slack off, and didn't make mistakes, a half-day shift paid 100 yuan, and a two or three-hour evening shift was also 100 yuan. [[12565 旁白 neutral]]
Her colleagues were all part-time students, and they got along well. But for some reason, the manager of this branch, Long Mian, was always targeting her. [[12566 旁白 sad]]
Besides being busy, she also had to endure scoldings. [[12567 旁白 sad]]
She had clearly requested and received approval for her leave. [[12568 旁白 sad]]
How could she go back to work in this situation? [[12569 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao glanced at Chi Xiaocheng beside her, and her phone rang again. [[12570 旁白 neutral]]
This time it was her professor. [[12571 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, how's your thesis coming along? The journal is publishing next week, so you should give me the first draft to look at in the next two days. Although the schedule is tight, I know you have the ability to do it." [[12572 导师 neutral]]
She was only a freshman, and since the school year started, she had already written two papers. This was the third. [[12573 旁白 sad]]
The professor's so-called mentorship and high expectations had all turned into pressure. [[12574 旁白 sad]]
She really didn't want to write that stupid paper at all. [[12575 旁白 sad]]
"So tired..." [[12576 苏桃 sad]]
Leaning back on the sofa, Su Tao thought about what Si Chen had said. [[12577 旁白 sad]]
So, so tired... [[12578 旁白 sad]]
Tears welled up uncontrollably again, but Chi Xiaocheng quickly wiped them away with her hand. [[12579 旁白 neutral]]
The small girl was now standing on the sofa, leaning over to pull Su Tao into her arms. [[12580 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, I... sob..." [[12581 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao could no longer hold back her tears and cried in her arms, holding her tight. [[12582 苏桃 sad]]
Such a warm and comfortable embrace was so wonderful. [[12583 旁白 sad]]
And so terrifying. [[12584 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng gently stroked the back of Su Tao's head and said softly, "Go on and cry. You'll feel much better after you let it all out." [[12585 池小橙 neutral]]
Let me take care of the things that make you unhappy. [[12586 旁白 neutral]]
After Su Tao cried herself to sleep, Chi Xiaocheng carried her to the bed. [[12587 旁白 neutral]]
Then she hid the fruit knife and quietly left the house. [[12588 旁白 neutral]]
