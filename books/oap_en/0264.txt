Chapter 264: Yang Keeps Scoring [[22474 旁白 neutral]]
After bringing her things into Chi Song's room, Su Tao didn't even have time to unpack before she quickly opened her phone. [[22475 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng, Chengcheng, Si Chen. [[22476 旁白 neutral]]
She contacted all three at once, sending the same message to each. [[22477 旁白 neutral]]
The sudden change in Chi Xiaocheng's attitude tonight made her realize that something was wrong. [[22478 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng's amnesia was definitely not as simple as she had thought. [[22479 旁白 neutral]]
However, the answers from the three of them left Su Tao at a loss. [[22480 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Based on what you've described, I suspect the headache was caused by Miss Xiaocheng's memories trying to resurface in that moment." [[22481 成医生 neutral]]
"Being reminded by a familiar scene is the simplest way to restore memory." [[22482 成医生 neutral]]
"However, it's possible that her subconscious is resisting those memories, so her brain is automatically creating new ones to make the confusing ones seem logical." [[22483 成医生 neutral]]
"That's why, even though you used to sleep together and her memory now says you 'occasionally sleep together some weeks,' she still doesn't want to sleep with you." [[22484 成医生 neutral]]
"Even though she is consciously trying to get closer to you, her subconscious is still resisting." [[22485 成医生 neutral]]
"If you don't plan on reawakening her memories, I don't have any better advice." [[22486 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng explained the cause to Su Tao, but he didn't offer the solution she was hoping for. [[22487 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chengcheng's reply was much more direct: "I've always supported you awakening Xiaocheng's memories. Since you chose not to let her suffer, you should just let things be and accept this new, better version of her." [[22488 程程 neutral]]
"It's pretty normal for unexpected things like this to happen, isn't it?" [[22489 程程 neutral]]
"Do you remember what I told you before? To gain something, you have to lose something else." [[22490 程程 neutral]]
That was all she said. Though her words were harsh, Su Tao knew Chengcheng was looking out for her. [[22491 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's reply was even more dismissive: "It's the New Year. Dr. Lin is already on holiday. She has her own life, so let's not bother her for now." [[22492 司辰 neutral]]
After reading the last message, Su Tao dropped her phone and fell back onto the bed, feeling helpless. [[22493 旁白 sad]]
That's right, the New Year is a busy time. [[22494 旁白 neutral]]
People aren't there to serve you 24/7; everyone has their own life. [[22495 旁白 neutral]]
It really was her fault for bothering them so anxiously over every little thing. [[22496 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao covered her forehead with her right arm, blocking out most of the light. Her eyes looked lost again. "What should I do now?" [[22497 苏桃 sad]]
It seemed like her relationship with Xiaocheng was getting better. [[22498 旁白 neutral]]
But now, they couldn't even sleep together. [[22499 旁白 sad]]
Should I just let things happen naturally... [[22500 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao took a deep breath and patted her cheeks firmly. "Su Tao, Su Tao, why do you always overthink things after one little setback? Not long ago, Xiaocheng still hated you. Hasn't your relationship improved now?" [[22501 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's just sleeping in separate rooms. If I spend these next few days building up our bond again, we'll definitely be able to sleep together." [[22502 苏桃 happy]]
The improvement in their relationship was clear to see. [[22503 旁白 neutral]]
She was just being too impatient right now. [[22504 旁白 neutral]]
"Take a deep breath, and adjust your mindset." [[22505 苏桃 neutral]]
Exercise could relieve her anxiety. After doing 30 standard push-ups in one go, Su Tao grabbed a change of clothes and went into the bathroom. [[22506 旁白 neutral]]
The water didn't need to be too hot; cooler water would help calm her restless mind. [[22507 旁白 neutral]]
She spent the evening organizing her room and bed and chatting with Chi Xiaocheng. [[22508 旁白 neutral]]
Then, it was time for bed. [[22509 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[22510 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't sleep. [[22511 旁白 sad]]
She used to hug this big brown bear to sleep. Even though the scented sachet had long lost its effect, she could still sleep soundly. [[22512 旁白 sad]]
Now, she only felt that the bear's fur was a bit scratchy against her skin. [[22513 旁白 sad]]
"It seems... it's not as soft as it used to be." [[22514 苏桃 sad]]
The next day, New Year's Eve. [[22515 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had already finished the big clean-up. The family didn't have much money for New Year's goods, not even for fireworks. [[22516 旁白 neutral]]
However, for many people, New Year's Eve held a special meaning. [[22517 旁白 neutral]]
Social media statuses, countdowns in friend circles, all kinds of year-end summaries, and promotional events on video platforms—countless people flocked to the idea of "crossing the year," seeking social validation everywhere. [[22518 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao thought, shouldn't she and Xiaocheng also create a better memory? [[22519 苏桃 neutral]]
Without telling Chi Xiaocheng, she secretly placed a camera next to the TV in the living room, aiming it at the sofa to record the New Year's Eve scene tonight. [[22520 旁白 neutral]]
Herself, Xiaocheng, and Da Wang. [[22521 旁白 happy]]
Two people and a cat lying on the sofa—Xiaocheng in her arms, and Da Wang in Xiaocheng's arms. [[22522 旁白 happy]]
Watching some TV, chatting a bit... it might be a little plain, but it would be very warm, wouldn't it? [[22523 旁白 happy]]
As Su Tao imagined the scene of their New Year's Eve, an expectant smile appeared on her lips. [[22524 苏桃 happy]]
The frustration of not being able to sleep together last night vanished completely. [[22525 旁白 happy]]
As she was thinking, she realized something else. [[22526 旁白 neutral]]
Speaking of which... where's Da Wang? [[22527 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao got up and knocked on Chi Xiaocheng's door. "Xiaocheng, can I come in?" [[22528 苏桃 neutral]]
"Come in." [[22529 池小橙 neutral]]
After getting permission, Su Tao opened the door and saw Chi Xiaocheng sitting on the bed, chatting with someone on her phone and smiling happily. [[22530 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked around the room and asked with confusion, "Xiaocheng, is Da Wang not in the room?" [[22531 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head. "Sister Su Tao, what are you talking about? Haven't you been taking care of Da Wang while I was sick?" [[22532 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's expression froze. [[22533 旁白 neutral]]
Taking care of him? She hadn't been in the mood at all for the past few days. [[22534 旁白 sad]]
After putting out the cat food, she had been at the hospital. Anyway, Da Wang usually came home by himself at night. [[22535 旁白 neutral]]
Did he not come back last night? [[22536 旁白 sad]]
Oh no, Da Wang couldn't have gotten lost, could he? [[22537 旁白 sad]]
For a moment, Su Tao felt a bit worried about Da Wang, but then she suddenly remembered that in all her memories, she and Xiaocheng had gotten Da Wang from the pet store when their relationship was good. [[22538 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, Xiaocheng's schizophrenia seemed quite serious, but she was very obedient because of what Su Tao said and loved her deeply. [[22539 旁白 neutral]]
They went on a date, played at a cat cafe, and she even got jealous over Da Wang. [[22540 旁白 neutral]]
That's right! [[22541 旁白 neutral]]
What are Xiaocheng's memories of Da Wang? [[22542 旁白 neutral]]
She had mixed up the bad memories, but what about the good ones? She hadn't tested that yet! [[22543 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao immediately went to the chair by Chi Xiaocheng's bed and sat down nervously. [[22544 旁白 neutral]]
She planned to ask. [[22545 旁白 neutral]]
Uh... about Da Wang, he'll come back when he's hungry, so I'll ignore him for now. [[22546 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pressed her legs, clad in beige tights, together and rubbed her knees nervously. "Xiaocheng, do you remember how Da Wang came to our home?" [[22547 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao with some surprise. [[22548 旁白 neutral]]
Although she didn't understand why she was asking, she answered truthfully, "I remember." [[22549 池小橙 neutral]]
Those two words made Su Tao's eyes light up. [[22550 旁白 happy]]
Xiaocheng remembers! [[22551 旁白 happy]]
The good memories haven't completely disappeared, right! [[22552 旁白 happy]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng's next words were not what Su Tao had expected: "After we had a fight, Dongfang Yang was worried I'd be lonely by myself, so he took me to his cat cafe. He played with me and made me laugh." [[22553 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's face broke into a happy smile, as if she were recalling an important moment. "Back then, he said he was busy and couldn't always be with me, so he gave Da Wang to me." [[22554 池小橙 happy]]
