Chapter 259: Ten Times the Corruption [[22071 旁白 neutral]]
"Lin Fangya, oh Lin Fangya, you really are useless!" [[22072 陌生男1 angry]]
"I told you to seduce the Second Young Master Ye, but you couldn't do it. You couldn't even gain his trust. In the end, you were almost taken away by Dongfang Yang and the others. We had to risk being discovered just to save you!" [[22073 陌生男1 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't see what was happening inside the dilapidated house; she could only hear a man's deep and impatient voice. [[22074 旁白 neutral]]
In contrast, Lin Fangya's voice was very weak. "This... this time was an accident. Just save me, and give me five million more. I will... I will definitely make that bitch Su Tao die without a proper burial!" [[22075 林芳雅 angry]]
Even though she was weak, her voice was filled with a demonic hatred when she shouted Su Tao's name at the end. [[22076 旁白 neutral]]
The man snorted coldly, "Five million? Do you have any idea what you're saying? As a member of the Lin family, you won't use your own money and instead ask the Dragon King to fund you?" [[22077 陌生男1 angry]]
"You're completely out of line!" [[22078 陌生男1 angry]]
He flicked his sleeve and snorted again. Anxious, Lin Fangya forgot her composure and yelled, "Wait!" [[22079 林芳雅 sad]]
"One million, just one million is fine. I've already contacted someone. As long as I have the money, I can definitely kill both Su Tao and that girl with the last name Chi. Just give me the money, and I'll do anything!" [[22080 林芳雅 angry]]
Her voice had completely lost its reason. "Even my body, you can use it however you want!" [[22081 林芳雅 sad]]
However, the man just looked at her as if she were a clown. "You hate those two that much? Just because Ye Liang died?" [[22082 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Hahahaha, letting them die would be a gift!" Lin Fangya sounded like a demon from hell. "Especially that bitch Su Tao, a total green tea bitch. She pretended to be innocent to seduce my Brother Ye Liang." [[22083 林芳雅 angry]]
"After causing Brother Ye Liang's death, she followed Si Chen and the others to take away the inheritance Brother Ye Liang left for me!" [[22084 林芳雅 angry]]
"And she even hit me at the banquet just now, humiliating me like that!" [[22085 林芳雅 angry]]
"What is death?" [[22086 林芳雅 angry]]
She laughed maniacally, "I want to strip her naked and throw her to that group of disgusting men in the slums. When she's desperate, I'll cut off her hands and feet and sell her. Not only that, I also want to..." [[22087 林芳雅 angry]]
She became more and more outrageous, but before she could finish, a very distinct "crack" sound came from outside the house. [[22088 旁白 neutral]]
It sounded like a branch being stepped on. [[22089 旁白 neutral]]
But a chilling aura faintly emanated from the darkness. [[22090 旁白 neutral]]
The man reacted the fastest, standing up alertly. "Who's there!" [[22091 陌生男1 angry]]
"Meow~" [[22092 旁白 neutral]]
A cute cat's meow came from outside the house. [[22093 旁白 neutral]]
It made the man relax suddenly. "Oh, it's just a cat." [[22094 陌生男1 neutral]]
But just in case, he walked to the broken window and looked out. [[22095 旁白 neutral]]
The moonlight was faint, and it was pitch black outside. The only thing visible was a pair of red, vertical pupils, like a cat's, staring back at him. They glowed faintly in the darkness, incredibly eerie. [[22096 旁白 neutral]]
It really was a cat. [[22097 旁白 neutral]]
But... why were the cat's eyes so high up? [[22098 旁白 neutral]]
The fear transmitted by those eyes made the man's hair stand on end. He felt a heavy sense of crisis and almost instinctively turned his head to the side. [[22099 旁白 neutral]]
A shiny fruit knife grazed past his neck, leaving a line of blood and a deep cut. [[22100 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, just a little bit later, and his throat would have been slit. [[22101 旁白 neutral]]
Damn it, who did Lin Fangya bring with her! [[22102 旁白 angry]]
Ignoring the pain in his neck, the man clutched his wound and quickly backed away. [[22103 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until the person with the knife flipped into the house that his pupils slightly contracted. [[22104 旁白 neutral]]
A... little girl? [[22105 旁白 neutral]]
A cloak covered her figure, hiding her face. Her almost blood-red eyes radiated violence. [[22106 旁白 neutral]]
Two brown pigtails rested on her shoulders, hanging down smoothly. [[22107 旁白 neutral]]
The man didn't know who the newcomer was. [[22108 旁白 neutral]]
But Lin Fangya was all too familiar with that brown hair. [[22109 旁白 neutral]]
Injured, she clutched her shoulder. She was frightened for a moment when she met Chi Xiaocheng's eyes, but then she started laughing. "Chi Xiaocheng, right? You're Chi Xiaocheng!" [[22110 林芳雅 happy]]
"Hahahaha! I can't believe you delivered yourself right to my door. Once I capture you, I don't believe Su Tao won't walk right into the trap!" [[22111 林芳雅 happy]]
She looked at the man. "Quick, catch her! Then we can easily take down Su Tao!" [[22112 林芳雅 angry]]
But the man wasn't motivated by her words. [[22113 旁白 neutral]]
Clutching his neck, he didn't even dare to run. [[22114 旁白 neutral]]
He felt a deadly pressure from the little girl in front of him. He hadn't felt such direct fear even when he was hired for deadly jobs abroad. [[22115 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng ignored the man, simply staring motionless at Lin Fangya. [[22116 旁白 neutral]]
The woman, with one arm already broken, staggered to her feet. [[22117 旁白 neutral]]
"If you won't do it, I'll do it myself!" [[22118 林芳雅 angry]]
She glared at Chi Xiaocheng with resentment. [[22119 林芳雅 angry]]
If it weren't for you two, my Brother Ye Liang wouldn't have died! [[22120 林芳雅 angry]]
I, Lin Fangya, would have become the mistress of the Ye family long ago! [[22121 林芳雅 angry]]
It's all your fault that I've ended up like this! [[22122 林芳雅 angry]]
"Chi Xiaocheng!!!" [[22123 林芳雅 angry]]
She screamed and lunged, clawing at Chi Xiaocheng's face with one hand. [[22124 林芳雅 angry]]
Even though she was injured, what harm could this little girl, who was barely over 1.5 meters tall, possibly do? [[22125 林芳雅 angry]]
Did she really think she was a fighting monster like Su Tao? [[22126 林芳雅 angry]]
But she never imagined that the current Chi Xiaocheng was even more terrifying than Su Tao. [[22127 旁白 neutral]]
As the pale arm reached for her, Chi Xiaocheng simply raised a hand and easily clamped down on it. [[22128 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she twisted. [[22129 旁白 neutral]]
"Arghhhhh!" [[22130 林芳雅 sad]]
With a scream, a straight arm was twisted like a pretzel in an instant! [[22131 旁白 neutral]]
The terrifying force could have snapped Lin Fangya's arm right off. [[22132 旁白 neutral]]
After taking the recovery pill, Chi Xiaocheng's body had temporarily returned to a normal, healthy adult state. [[22133 旁白 neutral]]
It was even better than her previous sub-healthy condition. [[22134 旁白 neutral]]
And she also had a tenfold increase in her corruption! [[22135 旁白 neutral]]
What does a tenfold boost to a normal person's constitution mean? [[22136 旁白 neutral]]
If she wanted to, with her current strength, she could smash Lin Fangya's head with a single punch! [[22137 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't want to do that. [[22138 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze was fixed on the screaming woman. "You're not screaming loud enough. Weren't you much louder when you were cursing Tao Tao just now?" [[22139 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng released the twisted arm and raised the fruit knife in her right hand. [[22140 池小橙 neutral]]
Then she looked at the man. "Excuse me, how should I address you, sir?" [[22141 池小橙 neutral]]
The man swallowed hard and said nervously, "I am an envoy of the Asura Hall, a subordinate of the Dragon King. I don't have much to do with this woman. I was originally bringing her here to silence her." [[22142 陌生男1 sad]]
"If... if you attack me, you will be making an enemy of the Asura Hall. The Dragon King will definitely... definitely not let you go." [[22143 陌生男1 sad]]
But his words lacked confidence. [[22144 旁白 neutral]]
But showing weakness was the same as surrendering, wasn't it? [[22145 旁白 neutral]]
He, an envoy of the Asura Hall, one of the Dragon King's trusted aides. [[22146 旁白 neutral]]
He would rather be killed than humiliated! [[22147 旁白 neutral]]
Then Chi Xiaocheng squinted and smiled. "It seems Mr. Envoy also wanted to harm my Tao Tao just now, didn't you~" [[22148 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng flicked her right hand, and the fruit knife shot out. Enhanced by the "Precision Scalpel" skill, the knife grazed the envoy's scalp, taking a patch of hair with it, and embedded itself in the wooden wall behind him. [[22149 旁白 neutral]]
The envoy felt the cold sensation of a bald spot on his head. [[22150 旁白 neutral]]
His legs gave out, and he dropped to his knees. "Sis, I was wrong!" [[22151 陌生男1 sad]]
