Chapter 26: Do You Like It? [[2226 旁白 neutral]]
"Do you like it...?" [[2227 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao put down her phone and leaned back against the pillow. Her beautiful hair fell to her shoulders as she stared at the ceiling with a melancholy expression, gradually lost in thought. [[2228 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't bear to see her get hurt. [[2229 旁白 neutral]]
She was someone very important. [[2230 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted her to stay by her side. [[2231 旁白 neutral]]
Many memories flashed through Su Tao's mind, but they finally settled on a scene from elementary school - that innocent and adorable little girl blinking her red-rimmed eyes, carefully calling her "big sister." [[2232 旁白 neutral]]
She took a deep breath and typed again, "I don't think I have romantic feelings for her. I see her more like a little sister." [[2233 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at this message and thought to herself that it was exactly as she expected. [[2234 旁白 neutral]]
In terms of romantic feelings, even Dongfang Yang might have a higher score than herself right now. [[2235 旁白 neutral]]
However, in terms of overall importance, they weren't as significant as she was. [[2236 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tried a different approach: "Miss Peach, do you think that Xiaocheng is pretty? If she wanted to be your girlfriend, would you reject her?" [[2237 池小橙 neutral]]
Peach: "Eh?" [[2238 苏桃 neutral]]
Peach: "Xiaocheng is certainly very pretty. Actually, 'cute' would be a better word to describe her. She's not lacking in looks at all. But about your second question, I really don't know." [[2239 苏桃 neutral]]
Without actually experiencing it, how could she say whether she could accept someone or not? [[2240 旁白 neutral]]
Even when making assumptions, Su Tao was extremely hesitant. [[2241 旁白 neutral]]
Humans are strange creatures. [[2242 旁白 neutral]]
When facing two or more choices, they become hesitant and think they can't make up their minds. [[2243 旁白 neutral]]
The truth is, when you're hesitating about whether to do something, you've already made a choice deep down - you just don't have enough reasons to convince yourself yet. [[2244 旁白 neutral]]
A simple example: you stay up late every night reading novels and watching videos. Sometimes you think you can't keep being lazy like this, and you consider whether to wake up early tomorrow and change yourself. [[2245 旁白 neutral]]
But you often hesitate about whether to stay up one more night. [[2246 旁白 neutral]]
When you start hesitating, it proves you already want to keep staying up. [[2247 旁白 neutral]]
Then you hide under your blanket, lying on your side with your head on your hand, your phone screen not too bright, lighting up that silly smiling face. [[2248 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao hesitate, Chi Xiaocheng understood clearly that the other person wasn't completely without feelings. [[2249 旁白 neutral]]
With this kind of beginning, it could grow into a wildfire. [[2250 旁白 neutral]]
The plan was feasible. [[2251 旁白 neutral]]
She typed to guide her: "Miss Peach, I understand your situation now. Pretending to like her is actually doable. According to what you've said, she likes you on one hand, and on the other hand, she depends on you and wants you to see her as your only one." [[2252 池小橙 neutral]]
"You just need to start from the second point. Be more caring with your words and actions, coax her a bit. You don't need to truly like her - just make her feel that you care about her a lot." [[2253 池小橙 neutral]]
"Then when her emotions are stable, you can work on adjusting them." [[2254 池小橙 neutral]]
Peach: "Okay, thank you, doctor. What about medication?" [[2255 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "I don't know her physical condition, so I don't dare prescribe medication carelessly. At most, I can give you some common medications that have few side effects and can stabilize emotions. If possible, you should find a psychologist to see her." [[2256 池小橙 neutral]]
Peach: "I understand." [[2257 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Mm, if you have any questions, you can continue to contact me. Trying our best to help every patient is our responsibility as doctors. Although I can't prescribe medication based on her physical condition, I'll teach you how to solve some mental problems." [[2258 池小橙 neutral]]
Peach: "Thank you so much!" [[2259 苏桃 happy]]
The chat ended, and Chi Xiaocheng put down her phone. [[2260 旁白 neutral]]
She knew that with Su Tao's personality, as long as she talked to her a few more times as Dr. Cheng and gained her trust, Su Tao would listen to most of what she said. [[2261 旁白 neutral]]
It didn't matter if she didn't like her now. [[2262 旁白 neutral]]
The future was still very long. [[2263 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, after organizing her emotions, Su Tao also got out of bed and moved around a bit. [[2264 旁白 neutral]]
She was naturally in good physical condition. In school sports meets, she was basically first place in the girls' long-distance running. After resting for one night, her fever had gone down considerably. [[2265 旁白 neutral]]
She came to Chi Xiaocheng's hospital room door, hesitating whether to go in. [[2266 旁白 neutral]]
What Dr. Cheng told her had a big impact. [[2267 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng's yandere tendencies were the type that didn't harm others, but she would hurt herself. She couldn't be left alone. [[2268 旁白 neutral]]
She also had to make her believe that she liked her. [[2269 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, Xiaocheng. I'm not trying to play with your feelings on purpose." [[2270 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao closed her eyes and prepared herself mentally. [[2271 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly opened the door. [[2272 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, good morning! How are you feeling?" [[2273 苏桃 happy]]
As soon as she entered, Su Tao began caring about Chi Xiaocheng's health. This part wasn't fake - she hoped more than anyone that Chi Xiaocheng could recover completely. [[2274 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat obediently on the bed, her small hands folded on her stomach. The blue and white hospital gown hid her petite figure. She smiled gently at Su Tao, "My fever hasn't gone down yet, but I'm feeling much better mentally. Taotao, have you eaten breakfast?" [[2275 池小橙 neutral]]
She reached out to press the call button to ask the nurse to bring breakfast. [[2276 旁白 neutral]]
But her outstretched left hand had some scratches from her injury, and when she raised it, Su Tao felt heartbroken again. [[2277 旁白 neutral]]
Taking two quick steps, she hurried to Chi Xiaocheng's side and grabbed her small hand. "I've already eaten. The hospital provides breakfast. You should get more rest if you haven't slept enough." [[2278 苏桃 neutral]]
"I can't sleep." Chi Xiaocheng felt the warmth on the back of her hand and suddenly said, "Want to chat?" [[2279 池小橙 neutral]]
"Sure." Su Tao brought over a small stool and sat in front of Chi Xiaocheng. When she looked up at her, she noticed something. [[2280 苏桃 neutral]]
She moved to sit by the head of the bed. [[2281 旁白 neutral]]
"What's wrong?" Chi Xiaocheng tried to look back, but Su Tao held her head still. [[2282 池小橙 neutral]]
She took out a comb. "Don't move. You didn't even fix your hair when you got up - it's all messy." [[2283 苏桃 neutral]]
With that, she gently ran her fingers through Chi Xiaocheng's hair. [[2284 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng simply leaned back, enjoying the treatment while making small talk. "Taotao, you smell so good." [[2285 池小橙 neutral]]
"Ah?" Su Tao paused her movements. [[2286 苏桃 neutral]]
Was this what they were going to talk about? [[2287 旁白 neutral]]
She curled a strand of Chi Xiaocheng's hair around her finger, not knowing how to respond. "This... might be the smell of the hospital body wash?" [[2288 苏桃 neutral]]
"No, it's not." Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved upward. "I don't smell as good as you do, Taotao." [[2289 池小橙 neutral]]
"No... Xiaocheng, you also... you smell good too." [[2290 苏桃 neutral]]
How embarrassing! [[2291 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's toes were curling in her slippers. She had always wanted to have a heart-to-heart talk with Chi Xiaocheng face to face. [[2292 旁白 neutral]]
Now she had the chance. [[2293 旁白 neutral]]
And they were talking about who smelled better! [[2294 旁白 neutral]]
She desperately wanted to change the subject but didn't know where to start. [[2295 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, Chi Xiaocheng didn't dwell on the topic of who smelled better. Instead, she seemed to think of something, paused, and looked at her clothes. "Speaking of which, when I woke up last night, I found that my hair was dry and my clothes were changed. There was also a new phone here. Who gave me a bath?" [[2296 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly answered, "I gave you a bath last night, and Dongfang Yang helped you get the new phone." [[2297 苏桃 neutral]]
"That's good. I was worried someone else had bathed me. If I became dirty, Taotao would definitely hate me, right?" Chi Xiaocheng let out a long sigh of relief. "Thank goodness it was Taotao." [[2298 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao scratched her cheek, feeling that Chi Xiaocheng's words sounded strange. [[2299 旁白 neutral]]
But remembering her chat with Dr. Cheng, she still responded, "Xiaocheng, don't overthink it. No matter what happens, I will never hate you." [[2300 苏桃 neutral]]
These comforting words should help stabilize Xiaocheng, right? [[2301 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't expect Chi Xiaocheng to follow up with another question: "Then do you like it?" [[2302 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao was confused. "Like what?" [[2303 苏桃 neutral]]
"My cuteness." [[2304 池小橙 neutral]]
