In the darkness, orange-yellow text appeared before her eyes. Chi Xiaocheng found it magical, and at the same time, she was a little surprised by the data. [[14300 池小橙 neutral]]
She hadn't expected Su Tao's data about her to be so detailed. [[14301 池小橙 neutral]]
Never mind the negative statuses; she felt guilty about those. [[14302 池小橙 sad]]
General fondness was probably for friends and family. [[14303 池小橙 neutral]]
Romantic fondness was literal, how much Tao Tao loved her. [[14304 池小橙 neutral]]
Possessive fondness was what surprised Chi Xiaocheng the most. She never thought there would be data for possessiveness. [[14305 池小橙 neutral]]
She had originally thought that she just needed to max out Su Tao's romantic fondness for her. Now, it seemed that if she also maxed out this possessiveness... [[14306 池小橙 neutral]]
In the future, it might even be possible to prevent the world's will from causing Su Tao's feelings to change! [[14307 池小橙 happy]]
But only 49 points of romantic fondness... [[14308 池小橙 sad]]
It's not even a passing grade of 60. Tao Tao, you're really breaking my heart. [[14309 池小橙 sad]]
The small doll suddenly flashed with a red light. [[14310 旁白 neutral]]
It was especially obvious in the dark room. [[14311 旁白 neutral]]
However, when Chi Xiaocheng turned her head, she met a pair of cat-like vertical pupils, but they were a ghostly green color. [[14312 旁白 neutral]]
This pair of green eyes almost scared Chi Xiaocheng to death. [[14313 池小橙 neutral]]
"Meow?" [[14314 大王 neutral]]
The owner of the green cat eyes seemed to be afraid of waking up its sleeping owner, so its meow was very quiet. [[14315 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing the sound, Chi Xiaocheng breathed a sigh of relief. [[14316 池小橙 neutral]]
Oh, it's just Da Wang. [[14317 池小橙 neutral]]
You stupid cat, you almost scared me to death. [[14318 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng reached out and pushed away the cat's face that was right in front of her. "Go play somewhere else, don't bother me. I'm just a doll right now." [[14319 池小橙 angry]]
After pushing it, Chi Xiaocheng suddenly felt herself flying into the air. [[14320 旁白 neutral]]
When she came to her senses, she realized her small body had been picked up by Da Wang. [[14321 旁白 neutral]]
"You... you stupid cat, quickly put me..." [[14322 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng started to speak in a hushed voice, but she was afraid of waking Su Tao, so she stopped her scolding. [[14323 池小橙 angry]]
She swore that when she got her body back and went home, she would show this stupid cat who the real master was! [[14324 池小橙 angry]]
And another thing! [[14325 池小橙 angry]]
Don't carry me around! Tao Tao finally managed to get a good night's sleep. If you wake her up, I'll make you into soup tomorrow! [[14326 池小橙 angry]]
... [[14327 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, after playing for a short while, Da Wang quietly lay back in its cat bed. [[14328 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng also took the chance to return to the pile of dolls, so as not to wake Su Tao. [[14329 池小橙 neutral]]
She just watched her beloved person sleep soundly as the night faded and morning arrived. [[14330 旁白 neutral]]
You can clearly tell how well you slept the moment you wake up. [[14331 旁白 neutral]]
Either your whole body is tired, your throat is dry, and your eyes feel sore after being open for just a short while. [[14332 旁白 neutral]]
Similarly, when you are in a good state of mind, the moment you get up, you will have the feeling of "I haven't slept this well in a long time" and clearly feel full of energy. [[14333 旁白 neutral]]
This was exactly how Su Tao felt. [[14334 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since Chi Xiaocheng had tried to end her life. [[14335 旁白 sad]]
No, even before that, she had rarely had a peaceful and relaxed sleep. [[14336 旁白 sad]]
But this time when she woke up, Su Tao could clearly feel that her body was much more relaxed, her head didn't hurt as much, and her stomach was clearly sending hunger signals to remind her it was time to eat. [[14337 旁白 neutral]]
If Chi Xiaocheng had put on the status glasses at this moment, she would have seen that many of the negative physical and mental buffs on Su Tao had disappeared. [[14338 旁白 neutral]]
At the very least, their severity had been reduced. [[14339 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lifted the covers and sat blankly on the bed. She touched her cheek, her face full of confusion. [[14340 旁白 neutral]]
There was even a hint of disbelief in her eyes. [[14341 苏桃 sad]]
"Why did I sleep so well last night..." [[14342 苏桃 sad]]
"This isn't right, it doesn't make sense, does it?" [[14343 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng is gone, so how could I sleep so peacefully?" [[14344 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao clutched her head in pain. She had expected to be half-asleep as usual, followed by another tiring day. [[14345 苏桃 sad]]
She would rather live in pain and unease. Even if she gradually got used to it, it shouldn't be like this now. [[14346 苏桃 sad]]
Usually, she could only get a stable sleep by holding Xiaocheng. [[14347 苏桃 sad]]
Now Xiaocheng was gone. [[14348 苏桃 sad]]
And she slept even better? [[14349 苏桃 sad]]
What a joke! [[14350 苏桃 angry]]
Doesn't this mean I don't need Xiaocheng at all? [[14351 苏桃 sad]]
Even though it was a remedy for stress, in her state of excessive self-blame, she would constantly make connections. [[14352 旁白 neutral]]
Her physical fatigue was much better. However, while her better mental state wouldn't leave her in a daze, it also made her more clearly aware of the reality that Chi Xiaocheng was gone. [[14353 旁白 sad]]
After sitting on the bed in silence for a long time, Su Tao slowly got up. [[14354 旁白 neutral]]
She went out, bought groceries, and made breakfast for two. Su Tao could clearly feel that her body and mind had recovered quite well. [[14355 旁白 neutral]]
But the better she felt, the worse her mood became. [[14356 旁白 sad]]
Wait a minute. [[14357 苏桃 neutral]]
Could the reason I slept so soundly, didn't even have nightmares, and felt relaxed, be because of that pill? [[14358 苏桃 neutral]]
Her memory went back to the night before their argument. [[14359 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was worried about her and gave her a pill that would help her sleep soundly. [[14360 旁白 neutral]]
She had thought it was something bad. [[14361 苏桃 sad]]
In the end, she, who claimed to see Xiaocheng as the most important person, couldn't even bring herself to believe her words? [[14362 苏桃 sad]]
So now, what else can I do for Xiaocheng? [[14363 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao finished her meal in a daze and opened a box. [[14364 旁白 neutral]]
Almost numbly, she took out a bottle of white liquor. [[14365 旁白 neutral]]
The wine went down her throat. [[14366 旁白 neutral]]
It didn't seem so harsh anymore. [[14367 苏桃 neutral]]
Time passed bit by bit. In the blink of an eye, half a day had gone by, and Su Tao had unknowingly drunk several more glasses of white liquor. [[14368 旁白 neutral]]
She used to hate the taste. [[14369 旁白 neutral]]
But now, only when she was drinking and her head was dizzy did Su Tao feel closest to Chi Xiaocheng. [[14370 苏桃 sad]]
It's just... the taste still isn't quite the same. [[14371 苏桃 sad]]
"I still want to be closer to Xiaocheng..." [[14372 苏桃 sad]]
But no matter how much she drank, she couldn't achieve it. [[14373 旁白 sad]]
