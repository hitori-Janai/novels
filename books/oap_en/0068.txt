Chapter 68 Tao Tao, I've Been Watching You [[5938 旁白 neutral]]
"Qianqian! Qianqian!" [[5939 苏桃 sad]]
In the dormitory, Su Tao jumped out of bed early in the morning and quickly went to Chen Qian's side, handing over her phone, "Why would Xiaocheng ask me such a question?" [[5940 苏桃 sad]]
—If I and Ye Liang fell into the water, who would you save? [[5941 旁白 neutral]]
Isn't this the classic "who would you save, your mother or your girlfriend" question?! [[5942 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to Su Tao's panic and confusion, Chen Qian just glanced at it indifferently and continued to rub her face mask. [[5943 旁白 neutral]]
Her tone was calm, "What else could it be? Chi Xiaocheng is having an episode." [[5944 陈倩 neutral]]
"This..." Su Tao's voice was conflicted. For her, it was truly one wave after another. [[5945 苏桃 sad]]
She had just come out of the dark room yesterday. [[5946 旁白 neutral]]
Today, Chi Xiaocheng had another new question. [[5947 旁白 neutral]]
Wave after wave of pressure, making her feel a suffocating sensation like being wrapped by a python. [[5948 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't make up her mind, "Then Qianqian, what should I answer?" [[5949 苏桃 sad]]
"Do you like Ye Liang?" Chen Qian glanced at Su Tao. [[5950 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips, first shaking her head, but then pausing halfway through. [[5951 旁白 neutral]]
She had a good impression, but it wasn't love. [[5952 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian inwardly "tsk"ed in displeasure, but didn't show it. Following Chi Xiaocheng's previous instructions, she said as usual, "You're foolish too. What's the use of caring so much about Ye Liang?" [[5953 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at her in confusion. [[5954 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian turned around and gently peeled off the mask from her face, saying very sincerely, "Logically, I shouldn't interfere with your choices, but as your best friend, I really can't stand to see you like this anymore. I just don't understand what's so good about Ye Liang." [[5955 陈倩 neutral]]
Chen Qian counted on her fingers, "Look, he orders you around." [[5956 陈倩 neutral]]
"He never gave you a good look." [[5957 陈倩 neutral]]
"Every time, I hear you say Ye Liang is looking for you, so you take a taxi to find him with your phone." [[5958 陈倩 neutral]]
"Why doesn't he come in person when he's looking for you? Dongfang Yang even drives his sports car to the dormitory building to find you. What about his attitude?" [[5959 陈倩 neutral]]
"He doesn't even reimburse you for the taxi fare!" [[5960 陈倩 neutral]]
"Oh, he says he likes you, he says he'll give you whatever you want, but what about his actions?" [[5961 陈倩 neutral]]
"What kind of domineering CEO is he? Besides being handsome, what else does he have?" [[5962 陈倩 neutral]]
"I really don't know what you like about Ye Liang." [[5963 陈倩 neutral]]
As she spoke, a roommate who was still sleeping reached out and responded, "Taozi, Ye Liang really isn't worth your attention. You're so perfect, you can choose any wealthy family you want, okay?" [[5964 舍友 neutral]]
Chen Qian glanced at her roommate, feeling that she herself was becoming abnormal. [[5965 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but fall into thought. [[5966 旁白 neutral]]
Speaking of which, why did she used to like Ye Liang so much, even to the point of opposing Su Tao? [[5967 旁白 neutral]]
After experiencing the power of Chi Xiaocheng's blackhead removal pill last time, Chen Qian had completely sided with Chi Xiaocheng and became a member of the "Orange Faction." [[5968 旁白 neutral]]
She let go of her entanglement with Ye Liang and slowly felt that something was wrong. [[5969 旁白 neutral]]
In high school, she had always been fawning over Ye Liang, and there was no earth-shattering encounter. Why did she like him so much, as if she had been cursed? [[5970 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as she saw Su Tao, she would become obsessed and want to confront her. [[5971 旁白 neutral]]
Something was wrong. [[5972 旁白 neutral]]
However, after thinking about it, she didn't care too much. Now, seeing Su Tao struggling and conflicted with Chi Xiaocheng, she was happy. [[5973 旁白 neutral]]
Reaching out to pat her best friend's shoulder, Chen Qian said earnestly, "Sister, face reality. You say Chi Xiaocheng is terrifying as a yandere, but at least she truly loves you, right? She's so cute and popular with both genders. I can't even imagine how comfortable it would be to hug her to sleep." [[5974 陈倩 neutral]]
As soon as these words came out, Su Tao faintly looked at Chen Qian, "Are you serious?" [[5975 苏桃 neutral]]
Chen Qian smiled, "Just a joke from your perspective." [[5976 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a little uncomfortable inside. [[5977 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had done that to her, she should stay away from her. [[5978 旁白 neutral]]
But hearing Chen Qian say she wanted to hug her to sleep, she felt a strange displeasure. [[5979 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if her own possession had been snatched away. [[5980 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't want to delve deeper into this topic and shifted the conversation to her phone, "Then how should I reply to Xiaocheng?" [[5981 苏桃 neutral]]
"Isn't this a death question?" [[5982 苏桃 neutral]]
But it seemed to be Ye Liang's life that was being sent. [[5983 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian said, "Chi Xiaocheng is a yandere. If you want to manage her emotions, you have no choice but to say you'll save her. But you can choose how deeply you commit." [[5984 陈倩 neutral]]
"What do you mean?" [[5985 苏桃 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "The standard answer is to save her and not Ye Liang, but you can also reply that you choose to save Ye Liang. That way, there will only be the two of you in the river of love." [[5986 陈倩 neutral]]
Saying that, Chen Qian snapped her fingers, "This way, Chi Xiaocheng will like you even more." [[5987 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao was dumbfounded, "Qianqian, you've never been in a relationship, how do you know so much?" [[5988 苏桃 neutral]]
"Thanks, I've been hit by a car." Chen Qian chuckled, "I usually read a lot of novels, and these are all answers copied from the comment section." [[5989 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao: "This..." [[5990 苏桃 neutral]]
She hesitated. [[5991 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian reminded her, "The key is the sentence above. Chi Xiaocheng and Ye Liang had a spat. If they both like you and want to compete, the question below is for you to choose." [[5992 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao swallowed, "But she only said a small... small spat, right?" [[5993 苏桃 neutral]]
"In front of a yandere, even the smallest spat will be magnified." [[5994 陈倩 neutral]]
Chen Qian sighed, "Do you remember what my uncle told you last time?" [[5995 陈倩 neutral]]
"Doctor Cheng?" [[5996 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes." Chen Qian nodded, "Either send Chi Xiaocheng to a mental hospital for treatment, or try to accept and appease her." [[5997 陈倩 neutral]]
The sleeping roommate poked her head out again, "Mental hospitals are not good. Didn't the news say that a child sent to an internet addiction school was beaten to death, and the parents earned 1.4 million with tears in their eyes? Mental hospitals are probably the same, right?" [[5998 舍友 neutral]]
It seemed to offer two choices. [[5999 旁白 neutral]]
But in reality, there was no choice at all. [[6000 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao lower her head in pain and struggle, Chen Qian gave her roommate a thumbs up. [[6001 旁白 neutral]]
The roommate smiled, everything unspoken. [[6002 旁白 neutral]]
And at this moment, Su Tao's phone suddenly vibrated again. [[6003 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian took it and glanced at it, making a "tsk tsk" sound, "Here, Taozi, Ye Liang is looking for you." [[6004 陈倩 neutral]]
It was a message from Ye Liang: Su Tao, what happened last time was my fault. I have something to tell you. I'm at the company. Come to my place. [[6005 叶良 neutral]]
Chen Qian shrugged and sighed, "He's making you run to him again. An apology is just 'my fault.' Ah~ he's truly a domineering CEO." [[6006 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lower lip, her hand clutching the phone seemingly tightening a little. [[6007 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian added fuel to the fire, "Alright, stop hesitating. Ye Liang is a young master, and he has many beautiful women around him. Maybe he's just playing with you and doesn't care about you at all." [[6008 陈倩 neutral]]
For any girl, the words "he doesn't care about you" are extremely damaging. [[6009 旁白 neutral]]
Long-term verbal manipulation, pressure from the external environment, and the commonality of topics among those around her, every point stimulated Su Tao's nerves. [[6010 旁白 neutral]]
When all the eruptions converged and were pointed out. [[6011 旁白 neutral]]
Memories blew like the wind. [[6012 旁白 neutral]]
The beautiful ones were subconsciously blocked. [[6013 旁白 neutral]]
The topics discussed around her gradually emerged. [[6014 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, maybe Ye Liang didn't care about her at all. [[6015 旁白 neutral]]
He ordered her around, never showed any concern. She was locked in a dark room by Xiaocheng for three days, and he did nothing. Instead, he scolded her as soon as they met. [[6016 旁白 neutral]]
If he cared about me, why didn't he come looking for me then? [[6017 旁白 neutral]]
Not to mention now, his apology is so flimsy, and he's making me go to his company like a servant! [[6018 旁白 neutral]]
How did Xiaocheng apologize when she did something wrong? [[6019 旁白 neutral]]
Tears welled up in her eyes, she clutched her sleeve, always blaming herself, and humbly begging her not to abandon her. [[6020 旁白 neutral]]
The tall shadow that vaguely occupied a corner of her heart was completely severed. [[6021 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao heavily typed two words in reply to Ye Liang: "Not going!" [[6022 苏桃 angry]]
Chen Qian and that roommate quietly watched her, a sinister smile playing on their lips. [[6023 旁白 neutral]]
Behind them, there seemed to be a small figure with tea-colored hair. [[6024 旁白 neutral]]
Like a shadowy ghost, lingering nearby. [[6025 旁白 neutral]]
