Chapter 143: I think... I'm a yandere. [[12590 旁白 neutral]]
Long Mian, the manager of the snack supermarket. [[12591 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's advisor, Ma Jicheng. [[12592 旁白 neutral]]
As Chi Xiaocheng walked out the door, she kept repeating these two names in her mind. [[12593 旁白 neutral]]
She knew the early plot of the original novel, so of course she understood the pressure these two people put on Su Tao. [[12594 旁白 neutral]]
The former constantly made things difficult for Su Tao at the store, docking her pay and assigning her heavy tasks, creating a "hero saves the beauty" moment for Ye Liang to show off. [[12595 旁白 neutral]]
The latter, as Su Tao's advisor, manipulated and tricked her into writing a thesis after she showed exceptional literary talent upon enrolling, claiming it would be published in a journal to pave the way for her future. [[12596 旁白 neutral]]
But in reality, the thesis Su Tao wrote was published entirely under the advisor's name, with no credit given to her at all. [[12597 旁白 neutral]]
These two characters were written by the author specifically to disgust the readers and Su Tao, and to give Ye Liang a chance to act cool and put others down. [[12598 旁白 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng had wanted to deal with them for Su Tao before. [[12599 旁白 neutral]]
But she was always caught up in other things and had no reason to act. [[12600 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't really handle these annoying problems, but if she just handled the people, wouldn't the problems solve themselves? [[12601 池小橙 neutral]]
Who gave them the nerve to bully her Taotao? [[12602 池小橙 angry]]
As she stepped out of the elevator, Chi Xiaocheng called Si Chen. [[12603 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello, Chi Xiaocheng? What's up?" [[12604 司辰 neutral]]
"Send a few people to wait for me at the school gate." [[12605 池小橙 neutral]]
"What do you need my men for?" [[12606 司辰 neutral]]
"To resolve a conflict." [[12607 池小橙 neutral]]
"???" [[12608 司辰 neutral]]
After hanging up on Si Chen, just as she was about to step out of the residential complex, Chi Xiaocheng's vigilance skill suddenly made her stop. [[12609 旁白 neutral]]
Someone is watching me from the shadows! [[12610 池小橙 neutral]]
Is it Ye Liang? [[12611 池小橙 neutral]]
Or is it that Lin Fangya, targeting Su Tao? [[12612 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng immediately looked at the System store. From her faked death and the past two days, Su Tao and the others had provided a total of 3466 Emotion Points. [[12613 旁白 neutral]]
If Su Tao's ability to handle stress wasn't already so strong, she would have gotten even more Emotion Points from her. [[12614 旁白 neutral]]
She could have probably gotten even more! [[12615 旁白 neutral]]
Even though Chi Xiaocheng had spent a few hundred on various preparations and burned through a lot of Emotion Points on items, she still had 2687 points left! [[12616 旁白 neutral]]
A single substitute scarecrow was definitely not enough for self-protection. [[12617 池小橙 neutral]]
Walking back into the complex, Chi Xiaocheng pretended to take out her phone and make a call under a pavilion. [[12618 旁白 neutral]]
But she was actually speaking to the System. [[12619 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's do a ten-pull gacha, Tongzi." [[12620 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, you could also spend Emotion Points in the store to buy what you specifically need. In your blackened state, you don't need to fear most dangers.] [[12621 系统 neutral]]
"Tongzi, what are you talking about? How could I possibly..." [[12622 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng stopped mid-sentence, suddenly stunned. [[12623 旁白 neutral]]
She lifted a hand, staring at her delicate palm, and fell silent. [[12624 旁白 neutral]]
"So... I'm in a blackened state right now..." [[12625 池小橙 sad]]
Her words were a wake-up call. [[12626 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't activated her acting skill at all. [[12627 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't even thought about whether she was being a yandere or not these days. She just followed her heart, keeping Taotao at home, protecting her, possessing her... [[12628 旁白 neutral]]
And then, over time, she might slowly fall in love with me... [[12629 池小橙 neutral]]
She even felt that constantly putting pressure on Su Tao was a normal part of the process. [[12630 旁白 neutral]]
Because many times, only by doing this would Su Tao pay attention to her. [[12631 旁白 neutral]]
Was it because of Dark Xiaocheng that I became a yandere? [[12632 池小橙 sad]]
Or was it because of that night in the bathtub? I was scared and subconsciously started craving everything about Taotao. [[12633 池小橙 sad]]
After all, during that time, she could clearly feel her life slipping away, bit by bit. She truly thought she was going to die, but then she remembered it was a plan to fake her death, just one part of the plan. [[12634 旁白 sad]]
The thought of Su Tao gave her the strength to endure and carry on. [[12635 旁白 sad]]
But in the end, she still lost consciousness while calling out for Taotao again and again. [[12636 旁白 sad]]
In the end, she couldn't hold on, and even regretted making a plan to fake her death. [[12637 旁白 sad]]
So, did this experience change me? [[12638 池小橙 sad]]
Or perhaps... [[12639 池小橙 neutral]]
"I was a yandere all along?!" [[12640 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng was a bit dazed. As the sun came out, a reflection from somewhere slowly brought her back to her senses. [[12641 旁白 neutral]]
She could rationally understand her past situation, but as soon as something angered her, that rationality would gradually fade. [[12642 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was silent for a long time before slowly saying to the System, "Do the ten-pull." [[12643 池小橙 neutral]]
[Okay, Host.] [[12644 系统 neutral]]
[Ten-pull in progress...] [[12645 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained: High-Efficiency Energy Potion (Replenishes all types of body energy, incredibly versatile).] [[12646 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained: Tranquilizer x1 (Can quickly calm a person's emotions).] [[12647 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained: Stress-Relief Pills x2 (Take before bed for a guaranteed dreamless eight-hour sleep, relieves stress and fatigue).] [[12648 系统 neutral]]
[Congratulations, Host, you have obtained the intermediate skill: Potential Burst.] [[12649 系统 happy]]
[Potential Burst (Intermediate): A passive skill. When the host has a strong desire to perform an action, their potential will be squeezed out and unleashed in an instant. In extreme situations, it can even be used to dodge bullets. The user will be weakened for 10 minutes after the skill ends.] [[12650 系统 neutral]]
[Congratulations, Host, you have obtained the intermediate skill: Precision Scalpel.] [[12651 系统 happy]]
[Precision Scalpel (Intermediate): When using a bladed weapon, the host will receive an all-around boost and enhancement. Strikes will be extremely precise, almost never missing their intended target.] [[12652 系统 neutral]]
Two skills, and no useless items! [[12653 池小橙 happy]]
And most importantly, she had finally gotten the self-defense and attack skills she had been hoping for in this gacha pull! [[12654 旁白 happy]]
Although the intermediate Potential Burst was an unstable passive skill, when combined with her vigilance skill, dodging bullets wouldn't be too difficult for Chi Xiaocheng. [[12655 旁白 neutral]]
And this Potential Burst could be paired with the Precision Scalpel skill! [[12656 旁白 happy]]
Blackened state + Precision Scalpel + Potential Burst. [[12657 池小橙 happy]]
I could probably take on 10 Si Chens and still win, right? [[12658 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng took the fruit knife out of her pocket. She felt like a hero from a novel, and with a flick of her finger, she performed a beautiful and cool knife flourish. [[12659 旁白 happy]]
Right now, she felt like she could peel an apple into the shape of a Chinese knot with her eyes closed. [[12660 旁白 happy]]
The arrival of the System's skills reduced Chi Xiaocheng's anxiety about the outside world. [[12661 旁白 neutral]]
She said silently in her heart, "Tongzi, thank you." [[12662 池小橙 happy]]
[It was the Host's good luck, it has nothing to do with this system.] [[12663 系统 neutral]]
[Also, Host, you might think I'm being nosy, but I have to mention that in your current state, it might be very difficult to win the affection of the female lead, Su Tao.] [[12664 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow, "Aren't you a villain system?" [[12665 池小橙 neutral]]
[Although I'm a villain system, the heroes we're supposed to be dealing with are Ye Liang and his group. Taotao is just too pitiful, sob sob sob.] [[12666 系统 sad]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng looked up at the clear sky and fell silent again for a long time. [[12667 旁白 neutral]]
"But Taotao doesn't even like me, does she?" Chi Xiaocheng murmured to herself, her eyes filled with sadness, "If I don't use the orange juice, if I'm not like I was before, will Taotao still stay by my side?" [[12668 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's words also made the System fall silent. [[12669 旁白 neutral]]
When she was well-behaved, Su Tao would just brush her off. [[12670 旁白 sad]]
Because she was obedient and wouldn't cause trouble, Su Tao went to find her fiancé, and even lied to her at the hospital about the engagement. [[12671 旁白 sad]]
And now that she wasn't well-behaved, now that she had become abnormal, Su Tao was afraid. [[12672 旁白 sad]]
So what exactly does it take to make her fall in love with me? [[12673 池小橙 sad]]
"Or rather, will she ever love me?" [[12674 池小橙 sad]]
