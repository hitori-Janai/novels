Chapter 266: The "New" Family Member [[22651 旁白 neutral]]
While Su Tao's mind was racing, Chi Xiaocheng had already picked up Da Wang with a look of disdain. [[22652 旁白 neutral]]
"How did you get so messy? You're getting the floor dirty. Didn't you think to clean yourself up before coming back?" [[22653 池小橙 angry]]
Compared to the Da Wang she had seen that night, he now looked as if he had rummaged through several trash cans, and he stank. [[22654 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang looked at Chi Xiaocheng, pitiful and helpless. [[22655 旁白 neutral]]
After letting out a "meow," he tilted his head towards the Ragdoll cat and meowed twice more. [[22656 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, the haughty Da Wang would have strutted over to Su Tao with a disdainful look, even if Chi Xiaocheng called him dirty, as if to say, "Silly human, aren't you going to wash me already?" [[22657 旁白 neutral]]
But now, for some reason, he had lowered his proud feline head. [[22658 旁白 neutral]]
His meows conveyed a message to Chi Xiaocheng. [[22659 旁白 neutral]]
He hoped she would take in the Ragdoll cat behind him. [[22660 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did Chi Xiaocheng get a good look at the timid and somewhat cowardly Ragdoll cat. [[22661 旁白 neutral]]
It was pure white with soft fur, and a small tuft of hair on its forehead was dyed a cherry pink. Because it had been wandering outside, its white fur was inevitably stained with dust and dirt. [[22662 旁白 neutral]]
The Ragdoll cat sat obediently on the floor, as if allowing Chi Xiaocheng a better look, but its darting eyes showed its unease. [[22663 旁白 neutral]]
It was like an elegant little princess, lost and shy around strangers. If Chi Xiaocheng didn't have her affinity skill, the little creature probably wouldn't have even dared to enter the house. [[22664 旁白 neutral]]
Looking down again to meet Da Wang's pleading eyes, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but ask, "Where did it come from?" [[22665 池小橙 neutral]]
"Meow, meow!" [[22666 大王 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded lightly. "So you found it. But there are so many stray cats outside, why did you pick only this one? Is it because it's pretty?" [[22667 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng reached out and poked Da Wang's face. "You naughty cat, you're just making trouble for your 'scooper'!" [[22668 池小橙 happy]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng didn't say no. She turned to Su Tao, who was walking over, and asked, "Sister Su Tao, can we adopt this cat?" [[22669 池小橙 neutral]]
"This Ragdoll is clearly a house cat. Look, it has a small tag on its neck. It might be lost. We should try to contact its owner first." [[22670 苏桃 neutral]]
Hearing Su Tao say this, Chi Xiaocheng realized. [[22671 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang might have lured it here; it wasn't necessarily found as a stray. [[22672 旁白 neutral]]
She tossed Da Wang aside, crouched down, and wiggled her fingers at the Ragdoll cat. "Come here, little one~" [[22673 池小橙 neutral]]
The Ragdoll cat hesitated for a moment, then got up and walked over to Chi Xiaocheng. [[22674 旁白 neutral]]
It then lay down obediently, showing no signs of aggression. [[22675 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to Da Wang, whose intelligence was enhanced by Chi Xiaocheng's medicine, this Ragdoll cat was much smarter. [[22676 旁白 neutral]]
After petting the cat for a moment to lower its guard, Chi Xiaocheng reached for the tag on its neck to take a look. [[22677 旁白 neutral]]
She read the two characters engraved on it out loud. [[22678 旁白 neutral]]
"Yingran." [[22679 池小橙 neutral]]
"Meeow~~" [[22680 桜苒 happy]]
The Ragdoll cat meowed sweetly when its name was called. [[22681 旁白 neutral]]
She flipped the tag over, and on the back was a phone number. [[22682 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao exchanged a glance, and then she took out her phone and dialed the number. [[22683 旁白 neutral]]
"Who is it?" On the other end of the line was a somewhat timid female voice. [[22684 陌生女1 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said slowly, "Hello, are you missing a Ragdoll cat named Yingran? She's pure white with a bit of cherry-colored fur on her forehead." [[22685 池小橙 neutral]]
The girl on the phone was silent for a long while before taking a deep breath and saying slowly, "My family went bankrupt. I... can't afford to keep the cat anymore. I don't want her. Please help me take her to a stray cat shelter." [[22686 陌生女1 sad]]
"If you want to adopt her... I hope you'll be good to her. Also, she likes..." [[22687 陌生女1 sad]]
As if pouring out her pain, the girl slowly described the Ragdoll cat's habits. [[22688 旁白 neutral]]
By the end, her voice was tinged with tears. [[22689 旁白 neutral]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng could say anything, the girl apologized and hung up the phone. [[22690 旁白 neutral]]
In the background, she could faintly hear two people arguing and the sound of glass shattering. [[22691 旁白 neutral]]
Bankruptcy, arguments, a cat... [[22692 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed softly and looked at Su Tao again. "Sister Su Tao, should we keep her?" [[22693 池小橙 neutral]]
In other words, she was asking if their family had enough money to raise another cat. [[22694 旁白 neutral]]
Although Chi Xiaocheng could make some money with her hacking skills, she couldn't tell Su Tao about it in order to maintain her persona. [[22695 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, Su Tao, the older sister, was in charge of the household. [[22696 旁白 neutral]]
Since Chi Xiaocheng had asked, of course Su Tao wouldn't refuse. [[22697 旁白 neutral]]
Just the fact that this new member was a Ragdoll cat and not Fang Ning was reason enough for her not to say no. [[22698 旁白 neutral]]
"Then I'll go give them a bath. They're both so dirty right now." [[22699 苏桃 happy]]
"Do you need my help?" [[22700 池小橙 neutral]]
"No, it's fine. Xiaocheng, just relax in the living room." [[22701 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao was in a good mood. Without even waiting for the cat to protest, she walked over and picked up the little pure-white Ragdoll. [[22702 旁白 happy]]
"Well then, Yingran, this is your new home now~" [[22703 苏桃 happy]]
After she spoke, Da Wang actively ran to Su Tao's feet and rubbed against her socks. "Meow meow~" [[22704 大王 happy]]
He wanted to be held too. [[22705 旁白 neutral]]
But to his surprise, Su Tao gently pushed him aside. "I can't carry you both. I haven't even settled the score with you for getting the floor dirty. Follow me on your own." [[22706 苏桃 angry]]
"Meow?" [[22707 大王 sad]]
What do you mean, you scooper? Got a new cat and forgot your old love? [[22708 旁白 angry]]
This cat is my new love, you hear me! [[22709 旁白 angry]]
Bathing a cat is a lot of work. You have to dry their fur, then mop the floor. Chi Xiaocheng already found it troublesome just thinking about it. [[22710 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao seemed to enjoy it. While she didn't have a "wifely" feel in any other way, her dedication to housework made one think of her in that light. [[22711 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, it was evening. [[22712 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of fireworks outside was endless. Seeing Chi Xiaocheng standing on the balcony looking at the sky, Su Tao had an idea. "Xiaocheng, do you want to go out and see the fireworks show?" [[22713 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned her head. "Fireworks show?" [[22714 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yeah." Su Tao nodded and took out her phone. "It's right by the riverside. They have a huge fireworks display every year, and there's a drone show too. Look at last year's video..." [[22715 苏桃 happy]]
She played the video, thinking that if they went together this year, it would surely become a wonderful memory. [[22716 旁白 happy]]
Besides, emotional bonds are strengthened by atmosphere. Countless novels and manga feature confessions under fireworks. Maybe in that kind of atmosphere, her relationship with Xiaocheng would grow closer? [[22717 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao had many ideas for this New Year alone with just the two of them. [[22718 旁白 happy]]
She wanted to try them all out with Xiaocheng. [[22719 旁白 happy]]
But to her surprise, the girl on the balcony declined her invitation. "The fireworks show doesn't start until 9 PM, right? That's too late for me. And also..." [[22720 池小橙 neutral]]
"And also?" [[22721 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao paused on those last two words. [[22722 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a "ding-dong" from the front door echoed through the living room. [[22723 旁白 neutral]]
The doorbell had been rung. [[22724 旁白 neutral]]
After her pause, Chi Xiaocheng's face lit up with joy. "And also, I invited Ningning to come hang out with us! We can ask her if she wants to go to the fireworks show." [[22725 池小橙 happy]]
She skipped happily towards the door. "Coming, coming, I'm opening the door!" [[22726 池小橙 happy]]
Her tone was much more cheerful than when she was with Su Tao. [[22727 旁白 neutral]]
Watching that retreating back, Su Tao's expression gradually stiffened. [[22728 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng's words from that afternoon echoed in her ears. [[22729 旁白 sad]]
A new member... [[22730 旁白 sad]]
With a bitter laugh, her anticipation for a world with just the two of them crumbled. [[22731 旁白 sad]]
