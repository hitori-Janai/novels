Chapter 3: I'm Going to Break [[193 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the cold glint of the small knife, the man in the suit felt his scalp tingle with fear. [[194 旁白 neutral]]
The beautiful moment from just now seemed like an illusion. [[195 旁白 neutral]]
Crazed and cornered—that was the true nature of the young, red-eyed girl before him, whose eyes seemed to glow with a demonic light. [[196 旁白 neutral]]
He swallowed hard, glanced at Su Tao who was trembling with her eyes shut, and took a small step forward as he spoke. [[197 旁白 neutral]]
"D-don't do anything rash, I..." [[198 西装男 sad]]
Before he could finish, Chi Xiaocheng cut him off. "I'll count to three. If you're not out by then, you can come back for her body!" [[199 池小橙 angry]]
As she spoke, she turned her gaze back to Su Tao, as if mesmerized, and whispered, "It's okay, Tao Tao. I've wanted to end this for a long time, but it would be so lonely without you~" [[200 池小橙 happy]]
I'm not trying to take you down with me. [[201 池小橙 neutral]]
It's because I like you. [[202 池小橙 happy]]
That's why we have to be together, no matter what! [[203 池小橙 happy]]
Without even giving Su Tao a chance to speak, Chi Xiaocheng glared at the man in the suit again. "Three!" [[204 池小橙 angry]]
"?" [[205 西装男 neutral]]
The man in the suit was stunned. [[206 旁白 neutral]]
What happened to one and two? [[207 西装男 neutral]]
His scalp was tingling. He had no choice but to quickly exit the room. [[208 旁白 neutral]]
He even thoughtfully closed the basement door for Chi Xiaocheng and took out his phone to quickly call his young master, Ye Liang. [[209 旁白 neutral]]
The moment she saw him leave, Chi Xiaocheng breathed a secret sigh of relief. [[210 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the System's voice echoed in her mind. [[211 旁白 neutral]]
[Ding! Congratulations, Host. You have reached 100 Emotion Points. Would you like to redeem the starter pack?] [[212 系统 neutral]]
"Redeem!" [[213 池小橙 happy]]
After shouting this in her mind, a virtual panel that only she could see appeared before her eyes. [[214 旁白 neutral]]
[Starter pack redeemed successfully.] [[215 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained random skills: Acting (Intermediate), Pain Reduction (Intermediate), Spiked Liquid (Beginner).] [[216 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could understand the first two skills. [[217 旁白 neutral]]
But the third skill... [[218 旁白 neutral]]
"System, what does 'Spiked Liquid' mean?" [[219 池小橙 neutral]]
[The Host can control the taste, nutritional value, and harmfulness of any liquid the Host touches, directly or indirectly.] [[220 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "???" [[221 池小橙 neutral]]
She thought of some scenarios that only appear in certain comic books. [[222 旁白 neutral]]
As everyone knows, a girl has many, many liquids on her body that can be 'spiked'. [[223 旁白 neutral]]
But the situation was urgent now, so she had no time for wild thoughts. [[224 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, Chi Xiaocheng had planned to escape through another secret door before the male lead arrived. [[225 旁白 neutral]]
But now... [[226 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze fell on Su Tao's face. [[227 旁白 neutral]]
The idealized female lead seemed to have had her brain shut down from everything that had happened. [[228 旁白 neutral]]
She just stared blankly with her mouth slightly open. [[229 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes were empty. [[230 旁白 neutral]]
She looked as if she had been broken. [[231 旁白 neutral]]
Actually, Chi Xiaocheng knew she was just overwhelmed with information and had spaced out. [[232 旁白 neutral]]
Fortune favors the bold! [[233 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had an idea for something even more memorable. [[234 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled. [[235 旁白 neutral]]
Tao Tao might not be able to accept it, but as the female lead, she must have a very strong will, right? [[236 旁白 neutral]]
So, should we give it a try? [[237 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't speak. The only response was the sound of the bed frame shaking continuously. [[238 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the door, the man in the suit finally got through to Ye Liang. He said anxiously, "Young Master, where are you? Something big has happened here, what should I do!" [[239 西装男 sad]]
Ye Liang's deep voice carried a trace of anxiety. "I'll be there in two minutes. What's the situation on your end?" [[240 叶良 neutral]]
"I found the basement, but that Chi Xiaocheng is using Miss Su Tao to threaten me. I can't do anything!" [[241 西装男 sad]]
"Damn bitch!" Ye Liang cursed. "I think that woman has gone crazy. Keep her calm for now, I'm on my way!" [[242 叶良 angry]]
Just then, the sound of Su Tao's struggling breaths and the creaking of the wooden bed came from the basement. Ye Liang, on the other end of the phone, was startled. "What's that sound on your end?" [[243 叶良 neutral]]
"This..." [[244 西装男 neutral]]
The man in the suit looked back at the wooden door, speechless for a moment. [[245 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't help but recall the scene he had just witnessed. [[246 旁白 neutral]]
A moment ago, it was just a kiss. [[247 旁白 neutral]]
Now the bed is creaking. [[248 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't dare to imagine what they were doing inside! [[249 旁白 neutral]]
You're both girls, how can you play so rough? [[250 西装男 neutral]]
He looked at his phone, still on the call, and fell into deep thought. [[251 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang urged, "Speak up! What's going on over there!" [[252 叶良 angry]]
The man in the suit took a deep breath. "Young... Young Master, what I'm about to say is very shocking. Please don't get angry." [[253 西装男 sad]]
"Stop wasting time and just say it! What the hell is going on!" [[254 叶良 angry]]
The man in the suit said, "Young Master, I suspect... you've been cheated on." [[255 西装男 sad]]
Ye Liang: "Who would be so bold!" [[256 叶良 angry]]
"Chi... Chi Xiaocheng?" [[257 西装男 sad]]
"???" [[258 叶良 neutral]]
A full three minutes later, Ye Liang finally arrived. [[259 旁白 neutral]]
With his side-swept bangs, black jacket, and imposing 1.8-meter height, he arrived at the basement door with several bodyguards. [[260 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the timid man in the suit at the door, he couldn't help but scold him with a cold face, "Useless!" [[261 叶良 angry]]
Then, he kicked the door open. [[262 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng, I'm warning you—" [[263 叶良 angry]]
Before he could finish, Chi Xiaocheng was nowhere to be seen in the room. [[264 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was still tied to the bed, her mouth slightly open and her eyes empty. [[265 旁白 neutral]]
Her beautiful hair was scattered over her shoulders, and her face was pale. [[266 旁白 neutral]]
On one side of the basement, a secret door was half-open. [[267 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang quickly came to his senses and rushed to Su Tao's side. "Su Tao, are you okay?!" [[268 叶良 sad]]
Hearing the anxious male voice, Su Tao paused for a moment and slowly came back to her senses. [[269 旁白 neutral]]
Her smile was like a withered rose. "Ye Liang, you're here..." [[270 苏桃 sad]]
Hearing her hoarse voice, Ye Liang's heart ached even more. [[271 旁白 neutral]]
He clenched his fists. "Chi Xiaocheng, I'll make her pay!" [[272 叶良 angry]]
Hearing that name, Su Tao's heart tightened again. [[273 旁白 neutral]]
That sickly sweet voice seemed to still be lingering in her ears. [[274 旁白 neutral]]
That voice kept telling her—I like you. [[275 旁白 neutral]]
She licked the orange juice from her lips and looked at Ye Liang. "Let's... let's not worry about Xiaocheng for now." [[276 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang was still furious. "Su Tao, you're just too kind! She tormented you like this, and you want me to let it go!" [[277 叶良 angry]]
"Um..." the man in the suit beside them weakly raised his hand. "Young Master, shouldn't we unlock Miss Su Tao's shackles first?" [[278 西装男 neutral]]
Ye Liang's face immediately turned awkward. [[279 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, I was so emotional I forgot. Su Tao, I'll untie you right now." [[280 叶良 neutral]]
After some searching, they quickly found the key that Chi Xiaocheng had intentionally left on the table. [[281 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, Chi Xiaocheng didn't... do anything to you, did she?" [[282 叶良 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao subconsciously touched her fingertips to her lips. [[283 旁白 neutral]]
My first... is gone. [[284 苏桃 sad]]
She even used her tongue... [[285 苏桃 sad]]
She and the man in the suit looked at each other, and both fell silent. [[286 旁白 neutral]]
