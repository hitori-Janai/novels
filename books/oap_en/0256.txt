Chapter 256: Is the distance really getting closer and closer? [[21795 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way, Si Chen." [[21796 苏桃 neutral]]
Just as Si Chen was feeling emotional, Su Tao suddenly looked at him. "I have a question for you." [[21797 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen came back to his senses. "What is it? Go ahead." [[21798 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at Chi Xiaocheng from a distance and asked first, "You... didn't you make a pact with Dongfang Yang and Ye Liang before? You don't like me anymore, right?" [[21799 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen didn't quite understand why Su Tao was asking such a vague question now. [[21800 旁白 neutral]]
He replied, "Of course I don't like you. I've always seen you as a friend. Besides, I know about you and Chi Xiaocheng, so how could I possibly still like you?" [[21801 司辰 neutral]]
You're beautiful, and you have a great, cool personality. [[21802 司辰 neutral]]
But is this simple question how you test your people? [[21803 司辰 neutral]]
Don't you understand the value of the 'Gilded Edition of Never Loving Tao'?! [[21804 司辰 neutral]]
But strangely, Su Tao was being very direct today. Before, she would have been very shy about asking such a question. [[21805 旁白 neutral]]
Just as he had that thought, Si Chen heard Su Tao's next question. [[21806 旁白 neutral]]
"Then do you like Xiaocheng?" [[21807 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen: "?" [[21808 司辰 neutral]]
All this time, he had always considered himself very logical. [[21809 旁白 neutral]]
Being on Chi Xiaocheng's side, he had an information advantage, which made it easy to fool Su Tao. [[21810 旁白 neutral]]
Today's question was the only one in a long time that he found difficult to answer. [[21811 旁白 neutral]]
Especially when he recalled how Su Tao had kicked Lin Fangya five meters away at the banquet. [[21812 旁白 neutral]]
From a standing position, one kick sent her flying five meters. [[21813 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't a running kick, and the other person was an adult of normal weight. [[21814 旁白 neutral]]
Man, that was a bit scary. [[21815 旁白 neutral]]
But he couldn't avoid the question. Si Chen knew Su Tao was starting to feel possessive of Chi Xiaocheng, which was exactly what they had planned for. [[21816 旁白 neutral]]
After hesitating, Si Chen replied softly, "I already said I know about you two. Chi Xiaocheng is cute, but I don't really like her in that way. You know, just like Dongfang Yang, I only see her as a little sister." [[21817 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao narrowed her eyes and nodded lightly. "Okay, I understand." [[21818 苏桃 neutral]]
Her lukewarm tone made Si Chen a little nervous. [[21819 旁白 neutral]]
But on second thought, he realized he had no reason to be nervous. [[21820 旁白 neutral]]
He really didn't like Chi Xiaocheng. Although the plan was to pretend to like her, it never said he had to confess or anything. [[21821 旁白 neutral]]
It's just an act. As long as the illusion is there, it's fine. [[21822 旁白 neutral]]
Anyway, I'm loyal to Xiaocheng, and she'll protect me later, so there's no need to feel guilty! [[21823 旁白 neutral]]
However, his purpose for being here wasn't just to chat. After taking pictures with the kids, Chi Xiaocheng continued to wander through the arcade with Su Tao. [[21824 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen shamelessly followed them, pretending to lack social awareness, and joined in on the games. [[21825 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng intentionally or unintentionally chatted more with Si Chen, subtly giving Su Tao the cold shoulder. [[21826 旁白 neutral]]
The two of them put on this act to cultivate Su Tao's possessiveness. [[21827 旁白 neutral]]
Poor Tao Tao, being played right into Xiaocheng's hands~ [[21828 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until 10 o'clock, after leaving the arcade, that Si Chen made an excuse to leave with his younger brother, Si Lai. [[21829 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao found it strange herself. Si Chen had helped her so much, so she should have been nothing but grateful. [[21830 旁白 neutral]]
But for some reason, she felt a little annoyed with him deep down. [[21831 旁白 neutral]]
Still, he didn't shamelessly stick around, and it was about time to head back to the hospital anyway. [[21832 旁白 neutral]]
Tonight's outing was almost over. [[21833 旁白 neutral]]
But actually, Su Tao wanted to spend more time with Chi Xiaocheng. [[21834 旁白 neutral]]
She blocked the wind and asked the girl beside her, "Xiaocheng, where do you want to go next?" [[21835 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled lightly. "I'm a bit tired. Let's just walk around a little more." [[21836 池小橙 happy]]
"Okay." [[21837 苏桃 happy]]
But the evening wind was getting stronger, making Su Tao worry if Chi Xiaocheng could handle it. [[21838 旁白 neutral]]
She stood to one side, trying her best to block the wind, but much of it still got through. [[21839 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was still holding the Big Big Wolf plushie. After walking for a while, she started to get sleepy. After a couple of yawns, she couldn't hold on much longer. "Sister Su Tao, maybe we should go back? Should we call a car?" [[21840 池小橙 neutral]]
"Mhm." [[21841 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded lightly, but instead of calling a car, she sent a message to Dongfang Yang. [[21842 旁白 neutral]]
It was late, and taking a taxi wasn't guaranteed to be safe. [[21843 旁白 neutral]]
This was something Dongfang Yang had always reminded her of: safety first. [[21844 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the girl beside her. "How about I carry you, Xiaocheng? Just like we said before. If you're tired, I'll carry you." [[21845 苏桃 happy]]
Then, I can feel that warm, soft little body again. [[21846 苏桃 happy]]
But her suggestion was rejected by Chi Xiaocheng. "That's okay. I see a flower shop over there. Let's go take a look. I can buy a flower for you, Sister Su Tao." [[21847 池小橙 happy]]
"Buy me a flower?" [[21848 苏桃 happy]]
"It's a gift, a reward for protecting me tonight, Sister Su Tao." [[21849 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't give Su Tao a chance to respond. She ran to the flower shop and had the owner wrap up a single white rose. [[21850 旁白 neutral]]
By the time Su Tao reached the shop, the white rose was already being offered to her by that small hand. [[21851 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled sweetly. "The gift is a bit simple, but... thank you, Sister." [[21852 池小橙 happy]]
This time, she left out the "Su Tao." [[21853 旁白 happy]]
The distance was closing, and their bond was growing stronger. [[21854 旁白 happy]]
From being disliked at the beginning, to clearing up the misunderstanding, to being called Sister Su Tao, and now this. [[21855 旁白 happy]]
Such a clear change was visible to the naked eye. [[21856 旁白 happy]]
Xiaocheng's affection for me is growing. She's starting to like me again, little by little. [[21857 苏桃 happy]]
And our relationship will get closer and more intimate. [[21858 苏桃 happy]]
Her gift didn't need to be fancy; as long as it was from Xiaocheng, Su Tao would love it. [[21859 旁白 happy]]
Just like this white rose. [[21860 旁白 happy]]
There are many kinds of flowers, but even with her jumbled memories, she hadn't forgotten that her favorite was the white rose. [[21861 旁白 happy]]
Taking the rose, Su Tao said to Chi Xiaocheng with sincere fondness, "Xiaocheng, you can continue to rely on me in the future." [[21862 苏桃 happy]]
Just like today. [[21863 旁白 happy]]
Even more than today. [[21864 旁白 happy]]
Soon, Dongfang Yang's car arrived. [[21865 旁白 neutral]]
He honked twice in front of the flower shop. The tall boy in the overcoat rolled down the window and whistled softly. "Time to get in, my two little princesses." [[21866 东方阳 happy]]
"Boss, you're being so cringey!" [[21867 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng giggled, hugging her Big Big Wolf plushie as she quickly got into the car. [[21868 旁白 happy]]
And Su Tao looked at Chi Xiaocheng with a hint of adoration in her eyes. "Don't be in such a hurry, you might hit your head." [[21869 苏桃 happy]]
She held the white rose and got in, closing the door behind her. But before she could even get properly seated, the show-off boy had already slammed on the gas. [[21870 旁白 neutral]]
Her body lurched, and the howling wind suddenly hit her face. Su Tao almost instinctively raised her hand to block it. [[21871 旁白 sad]]
But the wind was too strong. The white rose slipped from her hand and fell out the window. [[21872 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao reacted quickly, turning to lean out the window. "My rose!" [[21873 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at Su Tao in surprise but didn't think much of it. "It's fine, it's just a flower. I'll buy you a whole carload when we get back." [[21874 东方阳 neutral]]
"But..." [[21875 苏桃 sad]]
But that was from Xiaocheng! [[21876 苏桃 sad]]
Before she could finish, Chi Xiaocheng also chimed in, "Sister Su Tao, it's dangerous to stick your head out the window. Just let the flower go." [[21877 池小橙 neutral]]
Under the dim yellow streetlights, the rose fell into the middle of the road as the sports car drove on. [[21878 旁白 sad]]
It became smaller and smaller, the distance between them growing. [[21879 旁白 sad]]
Until another car drove by. [[21880 旁白 sad]]
"Screech." [[21881 旁白 sad]]
The white rose was run over. [[21882 旁白 sad]]
The pure white petals fluttered into the air, then gradually disappeared as the sports car continued on. [[21883 旁白 sad]]
The scene happened in an instant, yet it was like a slow-motion film reflecting in Su Tao's eyes, rolling gently. [[21884 旁白 sad]]
She didn't even have time to tell Dongfang Yang to stop the car. [[21885 旁白 sad]]
That was the flower from Xiaocheng, it was a gift! [[21886 旁白 sad]]
To her, it represented Xiaocheng herself, a symbol of their growing intimacy and closing distance. [[21887 旁白 sad]]
But now, Su Tao's eyes stared blankly. [[21888 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng was indeed relying on her, sweetly calling her sister. [[21889 旁白 sad]]
But the distance between herself and Xiaocheng... [[21890 旁白 sad]]
Was it really getting closer? [[21891 苏桃 sad]]
