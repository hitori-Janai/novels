Chapter 116: Was Your Love for Me a Lie? [[10221 旁白 neutral]]
"I like you. Can I be your girlfriend?" [[10222 池小橙 happy]]
The cold wind that had been howling inside the car now felt like a gentle breeze over the river. [[10223 旁白 neutral]]
The confession, once lost to the roaring wind and interrupted by an accident, was finally spoken. [[10224 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lowered her head slightly, looking at Chi Xiaocheng right in front of her, and stood there, stunned. [[10225 旁白 neutral]]
What kind of expression was on that small face? [[10226 旁白 neutral]]
Affection, anticipation, and sweetness, with a hint of possessiveness. Even with tears streaming down, she couldn't stop the smile playing on her lips and her faint dimples. [[10227 旁白 neutral]]
She had said she liked her many times before. [[10228 旁白 neutral]]
But this was the first time she had so clearly asked to define their relationship as a couple. [[10229 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, she was pretending to like her. [[10230 苏桃 neutral]]
And after that? [[10231 苏桃 neutral]]
Take it a step further and pretend to be her girlfriend? [[10232 苏桃 neutral]]
Wanting to protect Chi Xiaocheng was a perfectly normal feeling for Su Tao; it had been that way since they were children. She didn't think that kind of protection was the same as romantic love. [[10233 旁白 neutral]]
But it was undeniable that for a long time now, the memory of the childhood Xiaocheng was slowly separating from the Chi Xiaocheng of today. [[10234 旁白 neutral]]
Several times, she wasn't sure if her heart was fluttering or something else, all because of the affection and cuteness this person in front of her showed. [[10235 旁白 neutral]]
Her lips. [[10236 旁白 neutral]]
Her beautiful hair. [[10237 旁白 neutral]]
Her smiling face, always watching her. [[10238 旁白 neutral]]
The unique feeling of her skin. [[10239 旁白 neutral]]
And the little gesture of scratching her palm when they held hands. [[10240 旁白 neutral]]
All these little things in life made it hard for Su Tao to tell if she wanted the childhood Xiaocheng back, or if her heart was moved by the Xiaocheng in front of her now. [[10241 旁白 neutral]]
But maybe... that wasn't really her heart being moved. [[10242 旁白 neutral]]
Just like the strange feelings that came from facing danger together, it was more likely an illusion caused by the suspension bridge effect. [[10243 旁白 neutral]]
Besides... [[10244 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao reached into her pocket and touched a crescent-shaped jade pendant that was missing a piece. [[10245 旁白 neutral]]
This was the only thing the old woman who adopted her as a child had found on her. [[10246 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had always felt that this jade pendant might be related to her parents. [[10247 旁白 neutral]]
She wore it all the time and treated it as a good luck charm. [[10248 旁白 neutral]]
She had already forgotten her parents and considered Chi Xiaocheng's family her own. [[10249 旁白 neutral]]
But who would have thought... [[10250 旁白 neutral]]
The silence was like the wind weeping, and the fireworks filling the sky gradually faded. [[10251 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao avoided Chi Xiaocheng's expectant gaze and lowered her eyes to the ground. [[10252 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry, Xiaocheng." [[10253 苏桃 sad]]
The fireworks across the river stopped. [[10254 旁白 neutral]]
The last glimmer of light in the sky disappeared. [[10255 旁白 neutral]]
As clouds covered the full moon, the moonlight shining on Chi Xiaocheng grew dimmer and dimmer. [[10256 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng held the white roses, her eyes vacant, just like in her past life at the traffic light. "Taotao, you... what did you say?" [[10257 池小橙 sad]]
"I'm sorry, Xiaocheng," Su Tao repeated. "Um, I... I do like you, don't overthink it!" [[10258 苏桃 sad]]
"If you like me, why can't you say yes?" [[10259 池小橙 sad]]
*Drip... Drip...* [[10260 旁白 sad]]
Following Su Tao's gaze, tears dripped onto her boots. [[10261 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao quickly looked up, but Chi Xiaocheng's smile was gone. [[10262 旁白 sad]]
Her eyes were somewhat empty, and tears overflowed uncontrollably. [[10263 旁白 sad]]
She panicked and quickly said, "Hey Xiaocheng, I definitely like you. With our current relationship, we live together, eat together, sleep together, and we've kissed so many times, even if..." [[10264 苏桃 sad]]
"Even without that title, it's still the same, right? I still like you." [[10265 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng clutched the roses with one hand and grabbed the clothes over her heart with the other, shouting, "Since you've said all that, and it's just a title, why can't you say yes to me!" [[10266 池小橙 angry]]
Today had been so wonderful. [[10267 池小橙 sad]]
We went for a drive, chatted and shopped, went for coffee, petted cats at a cat cafe, went shopping at the mall, you bought me the perfect little orange hair clip, and you told me gently: [[10268 池小橙 sad]]
--"I like you." [[10269 池小橙 happy]]
When the accident happened, you picked me up, and even though you were worried and scared, you comforted me and told me not to worry. You said: [[10270 池小橙 sad]]
--"I will protect you." [[10271 池小橙 happy]]
Even when it was a matter of life and death, you didn't give up. You didn't want to involve me. And if death was the inevitable end, you said: [[10272 池小橙 sad]]
--"I want to hug you at the end." [[10273 池小橙 happy]]
Birthday, such a distant word. Even in my past life, I had never received a single birthday wish or a cake. It was just a cold number on my ID card, recording how many days I had lived alone since birth. [[10274 池小橙 sad]]
But you remembered. You wanted to surprise me, to give me a gift, and under the sky full of fireworks, you said to me: [[10275 池小橙 sad]]
--"Happy Birthday." [[10276 池小橙 happy]]
I like you, I like you so much. [[10277 池小橙 happy]]
I thought you liked me just as much as I like you. [[10278 池小橙 sad]]
But why? [[10279 池小橙 sad]]
Why! Why! Why! Why! Why! [[10280 池小橙 angry]]
"If you like me, why won't you accept my confession!" [[10281 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng screamed, her voice echoing across the riverside bridge. [[10282 旁白 angry]]
It was quickly drowned out by the sirens of approaching police cars. [[10283 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lowered her head completely, not daring to look into Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[10284 旁白 sad]]
She kept questioning herself in her heart. [[10285 苏桃 neutral]]
Do I really like Xiaocheng? [[10286 苏桃 neutral]]
Can I really handle her possessive and heavy love? [[10287 苏桃 neutral]]
"Couple" might just be a simple word. [[10288 旁白 neutral]]
But in Su Tao's eyes, that word was incredibly heavy. [[10289 旁白 neutral]]
She knew that once she nodded, there was no turning back. She would completely lose the chance to cure Chi Xiaocheng's yandere tendencies. [[10290 旁白 neutral]]
Because even if she was mostly cured, the moment she mentioned breaking up, Chi Xiaocheng would fall completely into the abyss. [[10291 旁白 neutral]]
It was less of a title... [[10292 旁白 neutral]]
...and more of a cage to imprison her. [[10293 旁白 neutral]]
A cage called "love." [[10294 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, she had another reason she couldn't say yes to Chi Xiaocheng. [[10295 旁白 neutral]]
Clutching the jade pendant that had always brought her luck, Su Tao took a deep breath and looked at Chi Xiaocheng with determination. "Xiaocheng, I like you!" [[10296 苏桃 sad]]
Would her emotions spiral out of control and turn yandere? [[10297 旁白 neutral]]
There was no sign of it in her eyes. [[10298 旁白 neutral]]
Then, just like before, I'll say I like her to calm her down, and then kiss her. [[10299 苏桃 neutral]]
Once she's calm, I'll explain everything properly and we can talk it out. It will definitely be okay. [[10300 苏桃 neutral]]
After all, Xiaocheng has been very well-behaved for the past half-month. [[10301 苏桃 neutral]]
There hasn't been any sign of her yandere side. [[10302 苏桃 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Su Tao added, "I like you, I really like you..." [[10303 苏桃 sad]]
Pretend to like her, and then... kiss her. [[10304 苏桃 neutral]]
The method Dr. Cheng had mentioned for calming down a yandere had never failed. [[10305 旁白 neutral]]
But to Su Tao's surprise, the hand she reached out was slapped away by Chi Xiaocheng. [[10306 旁白 angry]]
The wind blew through her beautiful brown hair as Chi Xiaocheng gave a self-deprecating smile. [[10307 旁白 sad]]
Beside her, a dark figure in a black dress appeared. [[10308 旁白 neutral]]
A small hand gently patted Chi Xiaocheng's shoulder as a low voice said, "See? I told you Su Tao was just pretending to like you. She won't even accept your confession." [[10309 黑化小橙 neutral]]
If the day up until now could be called "heaven"... [[10310 旁白 sad]]
...then this moment was "hell." [[10311 旁白 sad]]
Of course, Chi Xiaocheng hadn't turned yandere or lost her mind. [[10312 旁白 neutral]]
She just couldn't accept this reality. [[10313 旁白 sad]]
The insecurity and anxiety she had long since abandoned rushed back, gradually turning into despair that filled her completely. [[10314 旁白 sad]]
The clouds covered the full moon, and the only remaining moonlight shone on the white roses in her hand, now watered with her tears. [[10315 旁白 sad]]
The gloomy night gradually enveloped Chi Xiaocheng, as if wanting to merge her with the dark Xiaocheng by her side. [[10316 旁白 sad]]
She stood there in the shadow of the bridge and murmured. [[10317 旁白 sad]]
"Hey Taotao... you've been pretending to like me all this time, haven't you?" [[10318 池小橙 sad]]
"Right?" [[10319 池小橙 sad]]
