Chapter 122: Her Silence was Deafening [[10760 旁白 neutral]]
The living room lights were dim, like a fading sunset. [[10761 旁白 neutral]]
The chairs were neatly arranged, but by the sofa, things on the table were thrown everywhere. Items from the nearby counter and coffee table were swept to the floor, and an electric kettle had tipped over, soaking a large area of the floor. [[10762 旁白 neutral]]
If anything on the table was still in place, it was only a covered piece of white paper and an empty fruit knife sheath. [[10763 旁白 neutral]]
Was it a robbery? [[10764 苏桃 neutral]]
No, definitely not. [[10765 苏桃 neutral]]
This looked more like someone had an emotional breakdown and threw everything they could. [[10766 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes grew empty as she frantically looked around. [[10767 旁白 sad]]
Not just in the living room, but all the lights that could be turned on in the house were on! [[10768 旁白 neutral]]
"The room, yes, Xiaocheng must be in her room!" [[10769 苏桃 sad]]
"She has Dawang with her. With the cat there to comfort her, she wouldn't do anything foolish." [[10770 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao was terrified that Chi Xiaocheng would self-harm again, just like on the rooftop, preparing orange juice and pathologically demanding she drink it. [[10771 旁白 sad]]
If that happened, she would have to be hospitalized for a while again. [[10772 旁白 sad]]
She ran in a panic to Chi Xiaocheng's room. Outside, Su Tao could hear the cat's anxious meows, each one making her heart beat faster and faster. [[10773 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao gripped the doorknob and quickly opened the door, "Xiaocheng!" [[10774 苏桃 sad]]
"Meow, meow, meow!" [[10775 大王 sad]]
Dawang seemed startled and instantly darted out from between Su Tao's legs. [[10776 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze swept around the room. [[10777 旁白 neutral]]
The room was in stark contrast to the living room. It was not only clean and tidy, but even the items she hadn't had time to organize before were neatly folded and carefully placed aside. [[10778 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't notice these details; her mind was just buzzing. [[10779 旁白 sad]]
Where is she? [[10780 苏桃 sad]]
If she's not in the room, where could she be?! [[10781 苏桃 sad]]
The storage room, Brother Chi Song's room, the other smaller guest room—Chi Xiaocheng was nowhere to be found! [[10782 旁白 sad]]
"Right, the balcony!" [[10783 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao ran back to the living room and quickly went out to the balcony. [[10784 旁白 sad]]
Nothing. [[10785 旁白 sad]]
Still no one! [[10786 旁白 sad]]
Her breathing grew rapid, and she felt an indescribable sense of suffocation. [[10787 旁白 sad]]
"Drip... drip..." [[10788 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of dripping water slowly reached Su Tao's ears. [[10789 旁白 neutral]]
Was that water sound coming from the bathroom? [[10790 苏桃 neutral]]
A terrifying thought rose in Su Tao's mind, and her right hand couldn't stop shaking. [[10791 旁白 sad]]
Dawang came out of the bathroom and ran into the living room, meowing anxiously as if urging her to do something. [[10792 旁白 sad]]
For half a month, while Su Tao was away, Dawang and Chi Xiaocheng had become each other's only companion. [[10793 旁白 neutral]]
Even though it was still proud, a cat is a spiritual animal and can sense its owner's emotions. [[10794 旁白 neutral]]
Its anxiety was a sign that something had happened. [[10795 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's lips were dry and trembling slightly as she walked toward the bathroom, one step at a time. [[10796 旁白 sad]]
"No, no, no, no, no..." [[10797 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng!" [[10798 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao forcefully pushed open the half-closed bathroom door. [[10799 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes widened, her pupils contracting. [[10800 旁白 neutral]]
In the dim bathroom, the girl she had been thinking about was lying quietly in the bathtub, her body covered in bright red pigment. [[10801 旁白 sad]]
Her messy hair floated on the water's surface like black ink, contrasting with her pale and delicate face. [[10802 旁白 sad]]
Her delicate arm hung limply over the edge of the tub. Her fingertips were a faint blue, and drop by drop of crimson slowly dripped from them, showing that she seemed to be losing all signs of life. [[10803 旁白 sad]]
The floor was a mess. A bath towel was thrown aside, the mottled tiles on the wall looked cold and unfamiliar in the shadows, and a little yellow duck for bathing had fallen to the floor. Except for its pupils that cast an unnerving reflection, the whole duck had turned completely red. [[10804 旁白 sad]]
The red-stained duck stared straight at the door, and when Su Tao pushed it open, it seemed to cast a resentful and terrifying gaze. [[10805 旁白 sad]]
The dripping sound and the faint sound of running water mixed together, as if silently telling the story of Chi Xiaocheng's unspeakable pain. [[10806 旁白 sad]]
At that moment, Su Tao felt her mind go completely blank. [[10807 旁白 sad]]
Her legs went weak, and she collapsed directly onto the floor. [[10808 旁白 sad]]
In her mind, the hopeful smile on Chi Xiaocheng's face when she confessed on the bridge began to separate from the cold, still face before her. [[10809 旁白 sad]]
Just a moment ago, she was smiling at her, holding a bouquet of white roses, her eyes full of affection and love. [[10810 旁白 sad]]
So why did it turn into this? [[10811 苏桃 sad]]
Lying coldly in the bathtub, sleeping with her eyes closed. [[10812 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao felt that the bouquet of white roses she brought back from the bridge was so ironic. [[10813 旁白 sad]]
This scene seemed to be telling her something. [[10814 旁白 sad]]
Those white roses should have been crimson. [[10815 旁白 sad]]
The water, as if soaked with red dye, slowly flowed to the palm of her hand that was propped on the floor. [[10816 旁白 neutral]]
It was piercingly cold! [[10817 旁白 neutral]]
The cold shock brought Su Tao back to her senses. With her hair a mess, she looked up at Chi Xiaocheng, her lips trembling so much she couldn't make a sound. [[10818 旁白 sad]]
"This... this has to be fake, right?" [[10819 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng... how could she leave without saying goodbye?" [[10820 苏桃 sad]]
"Hey Xiaocheng, this is a joke, right? This is your yandere side, isn't it? To keep me here, you're pretending to sleep in the bathtub until I come back, right?" [[10821 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao stumbled to her feet, falling to the ground several times. Her clothes couldn't avoid being stained with the color of orange juice. [[10822 旁白 sad]]
The closer she got to Chi Xiaocheng, the more terrified Su Tao became. [[10823 旁白 sad]]
The distance of a few steps felt like centuries to her. [[10824 旁白 sad]]
Although she was physically fine, she couldn't summon any strength. [[10825 旁白 sad]]
Every part of this place was so oppressive; time itself seemed to have frozen. [[10826 旁白 sad]]
The girl in the bathtub was immersed in endless darkness, and all the good memories and pain were drowned along with her in the cold water. [[10827 旁白 sad]]
The water carried her reluctance, resentment, regret, and longing from her departure, transferring it to Su Tao's palm. [[10828 旁白 sad]]
She gripped the edge of the tub firmly. The overflowing water rippled as Su Tao tremblingly reached for Chi Xiaocheng's right hand. [[10829 旁白 sad]]
A deep cut danced on the main artery. [[10830 旁白 sad]]
Her skin felt so cold it was suffocating; she looked completely lifeless. [[10831 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's breathing became more and more rapid, and she even felt a little dizzy. [[10832 旁白 sad]]
But she let tears stream down her face and gathered all her strength to put a finger in front of Chi Xiaocheng's nose. [[10833 旁白 sad]]
"One second..." [[10834 苏桃 sad]]
"Two seconds..." [[10835 苏桃 sad]]
A faint breath hit Su Tao's fingertip. She jolted in excitement and leaned forward. [[10836 旁白 sad]]
Her legs gave out, and she fell to the ground again. [[10837 旁白 sad]]
Even though her forehead hit the bathtub, Su Tao didn't hesitate because of the pain. She quickly got up and placed her finger back in front of Chi Xiaocheng's nose. [[10838 旁白 sad]]
"There's still a faint breath, there's still a faint breath!" [[10839 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao cried with joy, and in that moment, she didn't even have time for regret. Her mind was racing. [[10840 旁白 happy]]
What should I do, what should I do, what should I do! [[10841 苏桃 sad]]
Anyone who saw such a horrifying scene would be unable to think rationally. [[10842 旁白 neutral]]
Not to mention Su Tao herself had many strange feelings for Chi Xiaocheng. She was in a complete panic, yet she didn't dare to touch her. [[10843 旁白 sad]]
"120... what's the number for 120..." [[10844 苏桃 sad]]
She quickly muttered the number, but she couldn't even hold her phone steady. [[10845 旁白 sad]]
"Calm down!" [[10846 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao gritted her teeth and punched herself hard in the face. [[10847 旁白 angry]]
A little bit of red trickled from the corner of her mouth and her nose. [[10848 旁白 neutral]]
But this pain was nothing compared to the pain in her heart. [[10849 旁白 sad]]
