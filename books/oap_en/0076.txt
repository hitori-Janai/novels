Chapter 76 Collapse, Confusion, Pain (Bonus for Xunyin Lingtu) [[6646 旁白 neutral]]
She no longer controlled her emotions. Tears streamed from her eyes, one hand clutched the clothes on her chest, and her hair was disheveled. [[6647 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang, are you forcing me?!" [[6648 苏桃 angry]]
Her trembling voice was no longer calm, but filled with suppressed roars, "You make me choose, you make me choose! Do I have a choice? What else can I choose besides accepting Xiaocheng?!" [[6649 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao smiled through her tears, "Just as you said, she's a yandere, very dangerous, and I know that. But what do you want me to do? Abandon Xiaocheng? Or ignore her? Or send her to a mental hospital?" [[6650 苏桃 sad]]
"Ye Liang, originally, if we just broke off our relationship, we could still be strangers who nod to each other in the future. If you ever have any trouble, and it doesn't endanger Xiaocheng, perhaps I could even help." [[6651 苏桃 sad]]
"But why are you forcing me?!" [[6652 苏桃 angry]]
"Do you have to make me choose between her and you?!" [[6653 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao's chest heaved continuously. Large gulps of cold air entered her lungs, making her extremely uncomfortable. [[6654 旁白 neutral]]
Her body trembled uncontrollably, unsure of what she was afraid of. [[6655 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, it would be fine to just break off the relationship in front of Xiaocheng. [[6656 旁白 neutral]]
Then, less contact. This way, they could still be ordinary friends, like strangers. [[6657 旁白 neutral]]
If it were Si Chen or Dongfang Yang, they might have understood the meaning of Su Tao's words. [[6658 旁白 neutral]]
But Ye Liang, still pressing, pointed at Chi Xiaocheng and said, "Why can't you choose? Whether a yandere can be cured is debatable, but I have money and resources. I can hire professional psychologists to diagnose and treat her. If you care about her, I can help you too." [[6659 叶良 neutral]]
"You never believed me, so how could you choose me?!" [[6660 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao chuckled, "How can I believe you?" [[6661 苏桃 neutral]]
"How many times have you said those words in front of me? 'If I hadn't stopped it', 'just to save my face', 'if it weren't for me, Chi Xiaocheng would have disappeared long ago', do you remember how many times you've said that?" [[6662 苏桃 angry]]
"Do you want to say it's for my own good?" [[6663 苏桃 angry]]
"You like me, and this is how you constantly manipulate me, constantly using Xiaocheng to pressure me?" [[6664 苏桃 angry]]
Ye Liang waved his hand, "I didn't!" [[6665 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao roared, "Then what you just said, that you wanted Xiaocheng to stay here forever, was that also false?!" [[6666 苏桃 angry]]
"You looked so pathetic reaching for that knife." [[6667 苏桃 angry]]
"An adult man, the crown prince of the Ye family in the capital, a CEO worth hundreds of millions, wanting to kill a little girl because he doesn't like her?" [[6668 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao said coldly, "Forget it, Ye Liang. If I had a choice, I wouldn't choose you between you and Chi Xiaocheng either!" [[6669 苏桃 angry]]
The words were completely spoken. [[6670 旁白 neutral]]
Past memories and affections were also severed with Su Tao's sneer. [[6671 旁白 neutral]]
If the words just now were merely to break off the relationship in front of Chi Xiaocheng, and there might still be a chance for private contact. [[6672 旁白 neutral]]
Then now, Su Tao was going to completely break ties with Ye Liang! [[6673 旁白 neutral]]
Anger, extinguished by Su Tao's words. [[6674 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang laughed disconsolately, "You had no choice, just because Chi Xiaocheng is a yandere?" [[6675 叶良 sad]]
She's crazy, so she gets all the love? [[6676 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao shook her head. There was no longer any affection or lingering attachment in her eyes towards Ye Liang, "I said it at the banquet before, didn't I? Xiaocheng and I grew up together, she's my only one. Why do you think that after accompanying me for four or five months, you can replace her?" [[6677 苏桃 neutral]]
No one can replace her! [[6678 苏桃 neutral]]
"Besides, I've always treated you as a friend." [[6679 苏桃 neutral]]
Another cold remark escaped her lips, and Ye Liang finally turned from pain to laughter. [[6680 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a little crazed. [[6681 旁白 neutral]]
"Haha... hahaha!" [[6682 叶良 happy]]
"So all this time, I've been deluding myself." [[6683 叶良 sad]]
"I'm not as good as Chi Xiaocheng?" [[6684 叶良 sad]]
"I'm actually not as good as Chi Xiaocheng!" [[6685 叶良 sad]]
Ye Liang took a step forward, and the accumulated snow beneath his feet seemed to melt. [[6686 旁白 neutral]]
His eyes were crimson, a premonition of blackening. [[6687 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, you don't think a casual breakup can clear everything, do you?" [[6688 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang stood in front of Su Tao, looking down at her and Chi Xiaocheng in her arms. [[6689 旁白 neutral]]
His smile, whether self-mocking or relieved, "I've spent so much on you, invested so much. You've been stringing me along, and now you're telling me to break up?" [[6690 叶良 angry]]
"How will you compensate me for the reputation, money, and connections I've lost, Ye Liang?!" [[6691 叶良 angry]]
His aura was dark and surging, as if he was about to blacken from collapse. [[6692 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hugged the already unconscious Chi Xiaocheng tightly, her hand hidden in her sleeve, her teeth chattering, "Ye Liang, what do you mean?" [[6693 苏桃 sad]]
"Ten million!" [[6694 叶良 angry]]
"Wh-what?" [[6695 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang grinned sinisterly, "The banquets, the people I invited, all ruined because of you and Chi Xiaocheng. Do you know how much that cost? At least ten million, right?" [[6696 叶良 angry]]
"If you don't pay back this ten million, do you think I'll let you go? Or do you two ordinary people want to fight against me, Ye Liang, and the Ye family?" [[6697 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang covered his face with one hand and laughed wildly. [[6698 旁白 neutral]]
It felt good to flip the table! [[6699 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at Su Tao's tightly pursed lips and pained, conflicted expression, Ye Liang couldn't help but feel pleased. [[6700 旁白 neutral]]
Jiuzhou City is my Ye family's territory! [[6701 旁白 neutral]]
However, just as he thought he had won, a voice came from afar. [[6702 旁白 neutral]]
"Isn't it just ten million? I'll pay it for them!" [[6703 池松 neutral]]
Ye Liang suddenly looked up and saw a one-armed man with a scarred face slowly approaching. [[6704 旁白 neutral]]
The man's face was grim, and his robust body seemed to contain immense power. With every step, the snow beneath his feet melted a little. [[6705 旁白 neutral]]
And beside him were several other men dressed like thugs, their faces covered in scars. [[6706 旁白 neutral]]
"Who are you?" [[6707 叶良 neutral]]
Ye Liang still walked arrogantly towards the one-armed man, sneering, "Don't you know that Jiuzhou City is my Ye family's territory?!" [[6708 叶良 angry]]
The man's face darkened, and the veins on his remaining right arm bulged. He threw a swift punch directly at Ye Liang's abdomen. [[6709 旁白 neutral]]
This tall adult man vomited bile all over the ground and flew back a full 10 meters! [[6710 旁白 neutral]]
In Chi Song's words, his anger did not diminish, "I'm their brother!" [[6711 池松 angry]]
Meanwhile, the bodyguards who had been enjoying the show finally reacted. [[6712 旁白 neutral]]
Just as they were about to rush over, they were knocked down by Liang Hei, who had already made his move. [[6713 旁白 neutral]]
But at this moment, several cars drove up, and the bodyguards Ye Liang had called earlier also arrived. [[6714 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song clenched his fist and waved to his subordinates behind him, "You dared to hurt my little sister. Leave them all here!" [[6715 池松 angry]]
Chi Song came to Su Tao's side, his eyes suddenly softening, "Don't worry, Xiao Tao, I'll protect you." [[6716 池松 neutral]]
Then his gentleness turned into sharpness as he looked at Ye Liang, who was clutching his stomach, his face contorted in pain. [[6717 旁白 neutral]]
His anger burned! [[6718 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed that due to the arrival of the crowd, the surrounding temperature rose. [[6719 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quietly held Chi Xiaocheng like this, not daring to touch the small knife in her abdomen. [[6720 旁白 neutral]]
Two lines of hot tears flowed from the corners of her eyes again. [[6721 旁白 neutral]]
The screams of flesh meeting fist were incessant, as if turning into the ringing in her ears after a sonic boom, buzzing and gradually fading. [[6722 旁白 neutral]]
Everything around her seemed to be in slow motion. [[6723 旁白 neutral]]
The wind blew. [[6724 旁白 neutral]]
The snow grew heavier. [[6725 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lowered her head and reached out to caress Chi Xiaocheng's pretty face. Tears involuntarily dripped onto her face. [[6726 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes, whether from exhaustion or emptiness, were fixed on Chi Xiaocheng. Her forehead touched Chi Xiaocheng's. [[6727 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's voice was hoarse, her lips trembling, and she whispered, her tone filled with confusion and fear. [[6728 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, is this the choice you wanted, right?" [[6729 苏桃 sad]]
