Chapter 89: Watch Closely, This Is a Yandere! [[7761 旁白 neutral]]
"Yandere?" [[7762 方柠 neutral]]
The little follower's voice was filled with confusion again as she slowly shook her head. [[7763 旁白 neutral]]
That made sense. She didn't even know what 'like' was, so how could she know about the 'yandere' trope? [[7764 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng also felt she was being too hasty. [[7765 旁白 neutral]]
She had just picked the girl up. Even if she wanted her to help with something, she should probably build up some goodwill first, right? [[7766 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's not talk about that for now." Chi Xiaocheng changed the subject. "What's your name?" [[7767 池小橙 neutral]]
"Fang Ning." [[7768 方柠 neutral]]
"Do people usually call you by a nickname or something more familiar?" [[7769 池小橙 neutral]]
Fang Ning looked at Chi Xiaocheng with an innocent expression. "Liu Guijia often calls me 'hey' and 'that one'. Does that count?" [[7770 方柠 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pressed her forehead and sighed. "Never mind. From now on, I'll call you Ningning, and you can call me Xiaocheng. The takeout should be arriving soon. After you eat, I'll show you what a yandere is." [[7771 池小橙 neutral]]
"Okay." [[7772 方柠 neutral]]
Fang Ning nodded obediently, the word "yandere" swirling in her mind. [[7773 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she was repeatedly confirming what she was about to do. [[7774 旁白 neutral]]
While waiting for the food delivery, Chi Xiaocheng gave Fang Ning a general definition of a yandere. [[7775 旁白 neutral]]
She also searched for the term on the Moe Encyclopedia and showed it to Fang Ning. [[7776 旁白 neutral]]
Even though her stomach was rumbling with hunger, the little girl read it very carefully. [[7777 旁白 neutral]]
"Because of love for someone, one develops an extremely twisted mentality and exhibits a strong sense of possessiveness..." [[7778 方柠 neutral]]
The doorbell rang. Fang Ning was holding the phone by herself, muttering the words on the screen. [[7779 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stood up and smiled slightly. "You probably can't understand it just by reading the text. Besides, there are many types of yandere. I'll show you more later." [[7780 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked to the door and opened it. "Hello, is that the delivery? You can just give it to me." [[7781 池小橙 neutral]]
However, after she spoke, the man standing in front of the door didn't react. [[7782 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up in confusion. [[7783 旁白 neutral]]
The delivery man was wearing a raincoat that wrapped his body tightly. The half of his face visible under the hood looked menacing. Chi Xiaocheng was only a little over 150 cm tall, so when she looked up, she could just see a pair of eyes under the hood. [[7784 旁白 neutral]]
They were bloodshot and constantly scanning the living room through the crack in the door. [[7785 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if... he was checking for threats. [[7786 旁白 neutral]]
This person wasn't a delivery man! [[7787 旁白 neutral]]
The hair on Chi Xiaocheng's arms stood on end, and she reached out to slam the door shut. [[7788 旁白 neutral]]
Then, with a "bang," the door was held open from the outside. [[7789 旁白 neutral]]
The man in the raincoat held onto the doorframe with one hand and stuck his head in. His burnt face under the hood broke into an aggressive smile. [[7790 旁白 neutral]]
He stared intently at Chi Xiaocheng's face, his voice hoarse, "My little cake, I've found you!" [[7791 陌生男1 happy]]
At that moment, Chi Xiaocheng was pressing firmly against the door from behind, as if trying to use her strength to push both the door and the man out. [[7792 旁白 neutral]]
She was frantic. "System, help me activate the blackening skill, quick, quick, quick!" [[7793 池小橙 angry]]
[Host, the blackening skill is a passive skill, I can't activate it...] [[7794 系统 sad]]
Anger itself is not an emotion that people can easily control. [[7795 旁白 neutral]]
And the man in the raincoat was still looking at Chi Xiaocheng with infatuation. "Did you know, the first time I saw you, I knew you were my little cake. I've waited so many days, and that man who was always watching by the neighborhood finally left~" [[7796 陌生男1 happy]]
These strange words of love sent shivers down Chi Xiaocheng's spine. [[7797 旁白 neutral]]
She continued to hold the door, preventing him from entering, while forcing herself to calm down. [[7798 旁白 neutral]]
If the other party forced his way in, she only had two options. [[7799 旁白 neutral]]
1. Use her emergency reserve of over 1,000 Emotion Points. [[7800 旁白 neutral]]
2. Get furious and then blacken. [[7801 旁白 neutral]]
And the prerequisite for option 2 was for someone to provoke her. [[7802 旁白 neutral]]
Or... [[7803 旁白 neutral]]
Stall this raincoat man and call her brother to come back! [[7804 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng immediately took out her phone, intending to try other methods first. [[7805 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to call her brother, but when the man in the raincoat saw this, he pushed the door hard. [[7806 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was, after all, just a frail little girl. Although her constitution had recovered to a sub-healthy level. [[7807 旁白 neutral]]
But after days of abuse, if she hadn't occasionally bought medicine from the system, she probably wouldn't have been able to hold on. [[7808 旁白 neutral]]
The door was pushed hard, and Chi Xiaocheng fell onto the rug in the entryway. [[7809 旁白 neutral]]
She had intended to call her brother, but she accidentally dialed Si Chen's number instead. [[7810 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng grabbed her phone and crawled back a few steps, then turned and shouted at Fang Ning, "Ningning, go hide..." [[7811 池小橙 angry]]
Before she could finish, Chi Xiaocheng noticed that Fang Ning had somehow appeared behind her. [[7812 旁白 neutral]]
She was holding a kitchen knife she had taken from the kitchen. [[7813 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes were fixed on the man in the raincoat who was walking in. [[7814 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's heart leaped with joy. She quickly snatched the knife and stood in front of Fang Ning to protect her. [[7815 旁白 neutral]]
From the phone, Si Chen's confused voice came through, "Chi Xiaocheng, why are you calling me?" [[7816 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng immediately said, "Do you have anyone nearby? Someone broke into my house to rob me, help!" [[7817 池小橙 angry]]
"Help?" [[7818 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen's voice was filled with doubt. [[7819 旁白 neutral]]
Seriously, you need my help? [[7820 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the tall man in the raincoat who was pressing closer, and she and Fang Ning slowly backed away. At the same time, she said to Si Chen, "Yeah, you expect me, a weak girl, to fight off a grown man? I can stall him for a bit, come quickly!" [[7821 池小橙 angry]]
After hearing this, Si Chen was silent for a full ten seconds. [[7822 旁白 neutral]]
Then he said to Chi Xiaocheng in a low voice, "Actually, Chi Xiaocheng, I still kind of like Su Tao." [[7823 司辰 sad]]
With that said. [[7824 旁白 neutral]]
The call ended abruptly. [[7825 旁白 neutral]]
Only the "beep, beep, beep" of the disconnected line remained. [[7826 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stuffed the phone into her pocket, gripped the kitchen knife, and stood up straight, her aura suddenly becoming sharp. [[7827 旁白 neutral]]
"That guy Si Chen... he still dares to like Taotao!" [[7828 池小橙 angry]]
Her voice was somewhat suppressed, which startled the little follower behind her. [[7829 旁白 neutral]]
The man in the raincoat heard Chi Xiaocheng's words and seemed to have found a new toy. [[7830 旁白 neutral]]
He walked toward Chi Xiaocheng step by step with a knife, threatening, "Little cake, the Taotao you're talking about is the one who often comes to your house, right? She's quite a beauty. Hehe, after uncle is done with you, I'll definitely make sure you sisters have a good reunion." [[7831 陌生男1 happy]]
The man's smile became more and more wild and crazed: "After all, your Taotao is also my prey~" [[7832 陌生男1 happy]]
His words reached Chi Xiaocheng's ears. [[7833 旁白 neutral]]
Her crimson pupils, which had been lacking a target and somewhat unfocused, suddenly and strangely became vertical slits, glaring fiercely at the man in the raincoat like a wolf. [[7834 旁白 neutral]]
With a "crack." [[7835 旁白 neutral]]
The wooden handle of the kitchen knife she was holding actually started to crack under her grip! [[7836 旁白 neutral]]
"What did you say?" [[7837 池小橙 angry]]
The blackening multiplier increased. [[7838 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took the initiative to walk towards the man in the raincoat, her long brown hair blown into a mess by the cold wind pouring in from the open door. [[7839 旁白 neutral]]
Her strange vertical pupils faintly glowed red. [[7840 旁白 neutral]]
The man in the raincoat had no idea what was happening with Chi Xiaocheng. Seeing her approach, a hideous smile appeared on his face, and he reached out to grab her. [[7841 旁白 neutral]]
However, the agility of this petite figure was beyond his expectation. [[7842 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng just tilted her head slightly and gracefully dodged his grasp. [[7843 旁白 neutral]]
With a flick of her arm, she swung the kitchen knife in her right hand. [[7844 旁白 neutral]]
Before the man in the raincoat could even react, his outstretched left hand had already fallen to the ground in a chunk. [[7845 旁白 neutral]]
"Arghhhhh!" [[7846 陌生男1 sad]]
The intense pain made the man scream. [[7847 旁白 neutral]]
His adrenaline spiked, and the man angrily swung his knife at Chi Xiaocheng. [[7848 旁白 neutral]]
But faster than him, Chi Xiaocheng's kitchen knife had already twisted into his abdomen. [[7849 旁白 neutral]]
And Fang Ning, standing not far away, dumbly recalled what Chi Xiaocheng had just said. [[7850 旁白 neutral]]
--I'll show you what a yandere is in a bit. [[7851 旁白 neutral]]
"So... this is a yandere." [[7852 方柠 neutral]]
