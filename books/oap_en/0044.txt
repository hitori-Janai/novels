Chapter 44 Doctor Cheng: This Old Man Knows Yanderes Best [[3756 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, another message followed. [[3757 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "Chi Xiaocheng, what does Su Tao mean by this? Did you pretend to be a yandere to train her?" [[3758 陈倩 neutral]]
The screenshot Chen Qian sent was exactly the same as the question on her Doctor Cheng alt account. [[3759 旁白 neutral]]
Would a yandere know they are a yandere? [[3760 旁白 neutral]]
"That's not right!" [[3761 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng gently tapped the table with her finger, "Su Tao actually suspects if I'm really a yandere. This isn't right, is it?" [[3762 池小橙 neutral]]
It was the basement, then the rooftop, plus Liu Guijia's incident. After her combination of moves, Su Tao should have been completely disoriented, otherwise she wouldn't have blindly sought out her, Doctor Cheng. [[3763 旁白 neutral]]
But why is she doubting now? [[3764 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't immediately reply to Su Tao with her alt account, but instead replied to Chen Qian, "Find out what's going on?" [[3765 池小橙 neutral]]
A few minutes later, Chen Qian sent several screenshots directly. [[3766 旁白 neutral]]
Because of their good relationship, Su Tao told Chen Qian many things, including what Liu Guijia said. [[3767 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "How should I reply to her?" [[3768 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Just say you don't understand either, and tell her to ask your uncle, the psychologist." [[3769 池小橙 neutral]]
After sending the message, Chi Xiaocheng's eyes became strange. [[3770 旁白 neutral]]
"System, did I say those words when I was being bullied by Liu Guijia?" [[3771 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, correction, you were bullying Liu Guijia.] [[3772 系统 neutral]]
"Don't interrupt, I was clearly the victim." [[3773 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had no recollection. [[3774 旁白 neutral]]
She considered herself a rational person. Now that she had transmigrated into cannon fodder, she was even more cautious. It was impossible for her act of pretending to be a yandere to be exposed. [[3775 旁白 neutral]]
Let alone coming from her own mouth. [[3776 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, you did say those words at the time. I thought you said them on purpose, and had other plans.] [[3777 系统 neutral]]
"Did I really say that?" [[3778 池小橙 neutral]]
[Yes, not only did you say you weren't a yandere, you also mentioned something about male and female leads.] [[3779 系统 neutral]]
"Hiss..." [[3780 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng gasped, "I actually have no memory of it!" [[3781 池小橙 surprised]]
[Perhaps you entered a yandere state, consumed by anger?] [[3782 系统 neutral]]
"Nonsense, I'm not a yandere. I was still communicating with you at the time. That's impossible." [[3783 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head in thought, "I suspect that the original owner's lingering thoughts influenced me." [[3784 池小橙 neutral]]
"Although it's cute, soul transmigration really does have an impact." [[3785 旁白 neutral]]
The system stopped speaking, and after Chi Xiaocheng sorted out the clues, she probably guessed Su Tao's purpose. [[3786 旁白 neutral]]
She asked Si Chen, then Chen Qian, and now Doctor Cheng. [[3787 旁白 neutral]]
"She doesn't want to believe I'm a yandere. She's avoiding it, she's scared. When she was with me, she was so gentle. I thought she was slowly falling for me." [[3788 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes flashed red, and her alt account replied, "Why do you ask? What happened?" [[3789 池小橙 neutral]]
"It's like this..." [[3790 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao told Doctor Cheng in detail about Liu Guijia's words, and also mentioned a method Si Chen gave her. [[3791 旁白 neutral]]
While serving as Ye Liang's maid for three days to repay his kindness, she would pretend to part ways with Chi Xiaocheng and see what her reaction would be, to determine if she was a yandere! [[3792 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng narrowed her eyes. [[3793 旁白 neutral]]
If it weren't for her Doctor Cheng alias, she wouldn't have known that Su Tao had such intentions. [[3794 旁白 neutral]]
But clearly. [[3795 旁白 neutral]]
She was still hesitating. [[3796 旁白 neutral]]
In that case, let's add some fuel to the fire! [[3797 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Normally, yanderes don't know they're yanderes, but there are a few rational micro-yanderes who vaguely feel that something is wrong with them, that they are too disgusting, to the point of hating themselves." [[3798 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "If you're worried, you can also use this method to test it." [[3799 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao: "But I'm afraid of problems." [[3800 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng: "Just stay by your friend's side at all times and soothe her emotions." [[3801 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "But there are two points to note." [[3802 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Please tell me." [[3803 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Your Xiaocheng seems to be a mild yandere. First, you need to pay attention to her reaction to your pretense. Perhaps she won't harm you, but she will definitely harm herself, so you must try your best to soothe her emotions and temporarily go along with her wishes." [[3804 成医生 neutral]]
"Secondly, there's Ye Liang. It's not out of the question that you might need to soothe Xiaocheng's emotions for a few days. During this period, it's best not to let your friend come into contact with Xiaocheng, lest her condition worsen. You need to handle these aftermaths in advance." [[3805 成医生 neutral]]
"Then you can test her." [[3806 成医生 neutral]]
The message was sent, and Chi Xiaocheng didn't receive a reply from Su Tao for a long time. [[3807 旁白 neutral]]
After several minutes of apparent struggle, Su Tao finally replied with one word: "Doctor Cheng, is this really okay?" [[3808 苏桃 neutral]]
She needed the courage to act. [[3809 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved upwards, and she immediately typed, "Don't worry, this old man knows yanderes best!" [[3810 池小橙 happy]]
Coincidentally, Chi Xiaocheng also didn't want Su Tao to be Ye Liang's maid. [[3811 旁白 neutral]]
Oh no, she absolutely couldn't be Ye Liang's maid! [[3812 旁白 neutral]]
Tao Tao, for the next few days, just stay with me. [[3813 旁白 neutral]]
Next, Chi Xiaocheng began to plan for her scheme. The two thousand yuan her brother transferred, besides buying two sets of clothes, would come in handy. [[3814 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, two days passed. [[3815 旁白 neutral]]
Under Chen Qian's report, Chi Xiaocheng learned that Su Tao would be going to Ye Liang's house tomorrow night. [[3816 旁白 neutral]]
And she also used Doctor Cheng's account to find out that Su Tao would ditch Ye Liang and choose to use this opportunity to test if she was really a yandere! [[3817 旁白 neutral]]
Since you want to test, then test me thoroughly! [[3818 旁白 neutral]]
As evening approached, the setting sun was crimson like blood. Chi Xiaocheng left school and walked along the path near her home. [[3819 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, a tall figure blocked her path. [[3820 旁白 neutral]]
He stood tall and robust, wearing only a white shirt to show off, even in late autumn. [[3821 旁白 neutral]]
His reserved face, his glasses reflecting the dazzling sunlight. [[3822 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng, can we talk?" [[3823 司辰 neutral]]
The person who came was Si Chen! [[3824 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's internal alarm bells rang loudly, and she instinctively took a step back, "Is there... something?" [[3825 池小橙 neutral]]
At this moment, she looked up slightly, meeting Si Chen's sharp eyes behind his glasses. [[3826 旁白 neutral]]
Like a venomous snake, looking down at its prey. [[3827 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng quickly lowered her head. [[3828 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyebrows, hidden by her bangs, furrowed slightly as she constantly pondered Si Chen's intentions. [[3829 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen, Su Tao, test, yandere. [[3830 旁白 neutral]]
Damn it, this person's background is that he studied psychology. The probability of my intermediate acting skills being exposed is very high! [[3831 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng decided to avoid him. She pulled the hood of her hoodie over her head and slowly said, "Sorry, Young Master Si Chen, I have something to do, so I'll be leaving first." [[3832 池小橙 neutral]]
"Don't rush!" [[3833 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen chuckled, "It's about Su Tao. Since you like her, aren't you going to talk to me?" [[3834 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "!" [[3835 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao actually told him that I like her?! [[3836 旁白 neutral]]
Or did this person guess it?! [[3837 旁白 neutral]]
"There's nothing to be surprised about. I was just testing you, and I didn't expect you to actually like Su Tao." In Si Chen's glasses, her small figure was reflected, "You subconsciously covered your head with your hood, you're afraid of me, and your body trembled, proving I was right." [[3838 司辰 neutral]]
"There are too many people here. How about we talk in the alley?" [[3839 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen put his hands in his pockets and turned directly. [[3840 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at his huge back and clenched her hands slightly. [[3841 旁白 neutral]]
Then she put her hand in her pocket, and soon, she exchanged a fruit knife from the system store. [[3842 旁白 neutral]]
With the knife in hand, she felt much more at ease. [[3843 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lowered her eyes and slowly followed. [[3844 旁白 neutral]]
The setting sun cast a long shadow of Si Chen. [[3845 旁白 neutral]]
The small girl gradually approached, hiding in the dark shadow. [[3846 旁白 neutral]]
Ps: It seems there are more readers on weekends. While everyone is on holiday, I'll update two chapters tomorrow morning, and add one more chapter tomorrow night. You can also leave suggestions for the plot in the comment section. I love copying comments. [[3847 旁白 neutral]]
Also, I'm updating steadily every day. Please give me some small gifts. [[3848 旁白 neutral]]
