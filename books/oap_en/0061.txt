Chapter 61 Crisis, Ye Liang Arrives! (Bonus for Bling Bling Black Cat) [[5371 旁白 neutral]]
At the community entrance, even Su Tao didn't expect to run into Ye Liang here. [[5372 旁白 neutral]]
He was in a suit, clearly just off work. [[5373 旁白 neutral]]
Upon seeing Su Tao, the word "displeasure" was written directly on his face, "Why didn't you listen to me?" [[5374 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao shrank her neck and quickly took out her phone to check her chat history with Ye Liang. [[5375 旁白 neutral]]
It turned out that for these three days, Ye Liang had been sending messages from time to time. The unimportant ones were perfunctorily replied to by Chi Xiaocheng. [[5376 旁白 neutral]]
Questions asked many times were all brushed off by Chi Xiaocheng with the excuse of "being sick and needing care." [[5377 旁白 neutral]]
And this morning, Ye Liang had sent her a commanding message. [[5378 旁白 neutral]]
Demanding her to meet him at his company. [[5379 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, Su Tao was still in the room, so Chi Xiaocheng naturally refused as usual. [[5380 旁白 neutral]]
And the consequence seemed to be that she angered this lord. [[5381 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang strode forward, his voice deep like muffled thunder, "What are you doing looking at your phone? Why didn't you listen to me?" [[5382 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao pursed her lips, looked directly at Ye Liang, and followed the lie Chi Xiaocheng had woven, "Didn't I tell you, Xiaocheng is sick and I'm taking care of her." [[5383 苏桃 neutral]]
"Just because of that, you didn't come to my company?" Ye Liang reached out to grab Su Tao's shoulder. [[5384 叶良 angry]]
But unexpectedly, Su Tao actually took a step back to dodge. [[5385 旁白 neutral]]
The domineering Ye Liang raised his head, even more displeased, and his hand reached out again with force. [[5386 旁白 neutral]]
"Slap—!" [[5387 旁白 neutral]]
This time, it was slapped away by Su Tao without hesitation. [[5388 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang said in a deep voice, "What do you mean?" [[5389 叶良 angry]]
"What do *you* mean!" Su Tao retorted, not bowing her head at all in the face of Ye Liang's tall and strong body. [[5390 苏桃 angry]]
Ye Liang took a step forward, "Say that again?" [[5391 叶良 angry]]
"Say what's wrong!" A hint of tears welled up in Su Tao's eyes, as if venting the pressure she had endured these past few days, she shouted directly, "What do you mean, just because of this, is it wrong for me to take care of Xiaocheng when she's sick?!" [[5392 苏桃 angry]]
"She has hands and feet, does she need you to take care of her?" [[5393 叶良 angry]]
"You have hands and feet, so why do you want me to go to your company and be your maid?!" [[5394 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao stubbornly raised her head, "Yes, you think Xiaocheng is hindering you, and she left a bad impression on you. You don't like her, but can you please not consider my feelings for her from your own perspective?!" [[5395 苏桃 angry]]
"When you need me, you summon me, when you don't, you dismiss me. You asked me to compensate you by being your maid for three days. I agreed. I took time to learn how to be a maid, to prepare necessary things, to ask for leave, to humbly discuss scheduling with my colleagues and boss!" [[5396 苏桃 angry]]
"Oh, you were free for those three days, so you just told me to go, and I went. Did you ever consider me?" [[5397 苏桃 angry]]
"I had everything arranged, and when I went to your company to find you, you just left someone to say you were busy and told me to keep waiting?" [[5398 苏桃 angry]]
"You didn't even send me a message on WeChat beforehand to explain!" [[5399 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao held up her phone and wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes with the back of her hand, "With you like this, what right do you have to talk about Xiaocheng? And I'm not your subordinate, don't order me around like you order your servants!" [[5400 苏桃 angry]]
The more Su Tao thought about it, the angrier she got, and she even brought up her past grievances against Ye Liang. [[5401 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang frowned, clenching one hand tightly. He knew that what Su Tao said was all true. [[5402 旁白 neutral]]
But his pride and years of being in a superior position made him unable to tolerate others defying him like this. [[5403 旁白 neutral]]
He retorted in a deep voice, "How many times have I told you, I have plenty of money. Even at school, the principal wouldn't dare touch you if I said a word. I can give you time and money!" [[5404 叶良 angry]]
"Why are you still working so hard?" [[5405 叶良 angry]]
"Working hard part-time, studying hard, facing those so-called friends who have no future and only know how to waste time, aren't you working hard for a better future?" [[5406 叶良 angry]]
"Everything you want, I can give you!" [[5407 叶良 angry]]
As long as you're my girlfriend, what can't you get? [[5408 旁白 neutral]]
This last sentence, Ye Liang didn't have time to say it, and it choked in his throat. [[5409 旁白 neutral]]
Because he noticed Su Tao looking at him with tears in her eyes and disappointment, "You keep saying you like me, but you don't even know what I want." [[5410 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang was struck by lightning, standing rooted to the spot, extending his hand blankly. [[5411 旁白 neutral]]
"Slap—" [[5412 旁白 neutral]]
"You're not as good as Xiaocheng at all!" [[5413 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao slapped his hand away and walked out of the community gate without looking back. [[5414 旁白 neutral]]
In her mind, Chi Xiaocheng's obedient smile appeared. [[5415 旁白 neutral]]
Three days. [[5416 旁白 neutral]]
In the first two days, she experienced confusion, suppression, and fear, and even Chi Xiaocheng's various coercions. [[5417 旁白 neutral]]
But at the last moment today, she was happy, warm, and at ease. [[5418 旁白 neutral]]
Head pats, hugs, chats. The brief tenderness was like returning to the time when they relied on each other as children. [[5419 旁白 neutral]]
Simple and likable. [[5420 旁白 neutral]]
This was exactly what she had always longed for. [[5421 旁白 neutral]]
Both saying they liked her, but compared to Xiaocheng, he was far inferior. [[5422 旁白 neutral]]
No comparison, no harm. [[5423 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was like this, and so was Ye Liang. [[5424 旁白 neutral]]
He stood there blankly, his mind filled with Su Tao's parting words. [[5425 旁白 neutral]]
—You're not as good as Xiaocheng at all. [[5426 旁白 neutral]]
He remembered the banquet where they argued, with thunder and rain. [[5427 旁白 neutral]]
—To me, Xiaocheng is more important than you! [[5428 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng! Chi Xiaocheng! [[5429 叶良 angry]]
It's Chi Xiaocheng again! [[5430 叶良 angry]]
As if sensing someone's gaze, Ye Liang suddenly looked up at the 5th floor directly in front of him. [[5431 旁白 neutral]]
On the balcony, Chi Xiaocheng's small figure stood there. [[5432 旁白 neutral]]
Her hands were clasped behind her back, and her lips were curled upwards. [[5433 旁白 neutral]]
As if mocking his distress. [[5434 旁白 neutral]]
"This guy..." [[5435 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang lowered his eyes and walked directly towards Chi Xiaocheng's location. [[5436 旁白 neutral]]
Grandpa Zhang, who was cracking sunflower seeds at the security booth, sighed, "Youth is truly wonderful." [[5437 张大爷 neutral]]
But unlike the old man's ease, seeing Ye Liang walking towards her, Chi Xiaocheng wasn't flustered yet, but the system was. [[5438 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, what should we do? Ye Liang is coming directly. He's the male lead who poses the biggest threat to us right now. Should we just lock the door and keep him outside?] [[5439 系统 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng put the knife back into the system space, her eyes calm, "I'll have to face Ye Liang sooner or later. There's no escaping it." [[5440 池小橙 neutral]]
[Then let's quickly spend all our emotion points? Draw a skill to protect ourselves first!] [[5441 系统 neutral]]
"Don't rush." Chi Xiaocheng asked, thinking, before Ye Liang came up, "System, what would happen if I stabbed Ye Liang?" [[5442 池小橙 neutral]]
[You can't do that. He's the male lead. The world's will would definitely intervene. And he's walking straight towards us. If something happens, we, the villainous cannon fodder, will be directly eliminated.] [[5443 系统 sad]]
[Self-preservation, try not to provoke him, that's the best.] [[5444 系统 neutral]]
"That's true!" [[5445 池小橙 neutral]]
Stabbing someone is too fanciful. [[5446 旁白 neutral]]
[So, Host, how about a draw first?] [[5447 系统 neutral]]
"What's there to be afraid of?" Chi Xiaocheng wasn't flustered at all, "If Ye Liang gets rough later, just say something to provoke me and make me blacken. I'll beat him down with 10 times my combat power!" [[5448 池小橙 neutral]]
[...] [[5449 系统 neutral]]
Host, I provoked you. Are you sure the first person you stab after blackening won't be me? [[5450 系统 sad]]
"Alright, System, don't worry. I probably have a plan in mind." [[5451 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng calmly turned and looked towards the door. [[5452 旁白 neutral]]
And at this moment, the door was hit with a "thump." [[5453 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang, he's here! [[5454 旁白 neutral]]
