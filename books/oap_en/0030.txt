Chapter 30: System Rewards, Huge Improvement! [[2545 旁白 neutral]]
After leaving the hospital, Chi Xiaocheng stretched her body. Even though she had been on IV drips for three days, she still didn't feel as good as before. [[2546 旁白 neutral]]
When she first traveled through time, she was already physically weak and was being chased around. [[2547 旁白 neutral]]
The night before last, she also got a high fever because of her plan. [[2548 旁白 neutral]]
If she hadn't taken the System's medicine, Chi Xiaocheng felt that even if she didn't die from serious illness, she would have had to stay in the hospital for three to five months. [[2549 旁白 neutral]]
Getting out in four days wouldn't delay too much time or cause her to fall behind the novel's plot. [[2550 旁白 neutral]]
Back home, Chi Xiaocheng first took a comfortable bath, experienced the charm of a girl's body, then put on a little dress from the closet. [[2551 旁白 neutral]]
She pulled down her neckline slightly with her thumb and made a peace sign with her index and middle fingers. [[2552 旁白 neutral]]
"Click—" [[2553 旁白 neutral]]
A selfie: a few water droplets clinging to her skin, flowing down her delicate collarbone into the gently curved lines, strands of hair sticking to her pretty face, cute yet with a hint of allure. [[2554 旁白 neutral]]
She sent this selfie to Su Tao and typed, "I'm back home, just took a bath." [[2555 池小橙 neutral]]
Then she changed into ordinary casual clothes and took a rather unremarkable photo. [[2556 旁白 neutral]]
She posted it on her social media with a caption. [[2557 旁白 neutral]]
"Do I look better without makeup?" — visible to everyone. [[2558 池小橙 neutral]]
The photo had lots of shadows, was a bit overexposed, and the angle was nothing special, just like a newbie who couldn't take photos. [[2559 旁白 neutral]]
Although it wasn't outstanding, Chi Xiaocheng's beauty was undeniable. Even this casual shot was stunning. [[2560 旁白 neutral]]
After doing all this, Chi Xiaocheng returned to her room and sat down. "System, how many Emotion Points do I have now?" [[2561 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, 2333] [[2562 系统 neutral]]
These past few days, since nothing much happened, she didn't gain many Emotion Points. The big chunk was still from that stormy night. [[2563 旁白 neutral]]
"I can do two ten-pulls now. Although I don't know this system's probability rates, I should at least get two skills guaranteed." [[2564 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng browsed the system shop while thinking about how to spend this fortune. [[2565 旁白 neutral]]
"System, let's do a ten-pull first!" [[2566 池小橙 neutral]]
These past few days had been like walking on thin ice. It was time for this useless system to be useful! [[2567 旁白 neutral]]
Ten cards spread out in the center of the system panel, with one glowing gold and another faintly white. [[2568 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow. "Two skills?" [[2569 池小橙 neutral]]
With a wave of her hand, all the card contents were revealed. [[2570 旁白 neutral]]
[Obtained Delicate Soft Candy x1 (taking it makes skin more delicate)] [[2571 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained Sleep Chocolate x3 (taking it puts you into at least 6 hours of deep sleep within 1 minute, greatly restoring fatigue)] [[2572 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained Cinderella's Handkerchief x1 (whoever gets the handkerchief will unconsciously think of the host)] [[2573 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained Wine-filled Chocolate x3 (taking it quickly puts you in a tipsy state)] [[2574 系统 neutral]]
[Congratulations host on obtaining passive skill: Cat Eyes (Basic)] [[2575 系统 neutral]]
[Cat Eyes (Basic): When the host stares at someone for a long time and feels strong emotions, pupils will become mysterious and emit a hypnotic glow, creating a powerful intimidating effect] [[2576 系统 neutral]]
[Congratulations host on obtaining skill: Surface Recovery (Intermediate)] [[2577 系统 neutral]]
[Surface Recovery (Intermediate): Speeds up recovery from any surface injuries the host suffers, removes scars, and restores to original condition] [[2578 系统 neutral]]
8 items, 2 skills! [[2579 旁白 neutral]]
And they all looked pretty useful. [[2580 旁白 neutral]]
Especially that Cinderella's handkerchief. In Chi Xiaocheng's view, its effect was no worse than these two skills! [[2581 旁白 neutral]]
If she gave it to Su Tao, her impression in Su Tao's heart could deepen further. [[2582 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng also felt that these two skills were specially matched for her by the system. [[2583 旁白 neutral]]
Her eye color was already an unusual crimson red. Every time she used her acting skills, Chi Xiaocheng would try to make her gaze look sickly. [[2584 旁白 neutral]]
Now with this Cat Eyes skill, she wouldn't have to glare like she was cross-eyed. [[2585 旁白 neutral]]
The other Surface Recovery skill needed no explanation. [[2586 旁白 neutral]]
Recovery skills were like mini-miracles for her current self! [[2587 旁白 neutral]]
And they said the lottery was completely random. [[2588 旁白 neutral]]
"I think you're just being tsundere, System. If you love me, just say so." [[2589 池小橙 happy]]
[......] [[2590 系统 neutral]]
With over 1000 points left, Chi Xiaocheng wanted to do another ten-pull right away. [[2591 旁白 neutral]]
But reason ultimately won over impulse. [[2592 旁白 neutral]]
"System, exchange for a Body Strengthening Potion in the shop." [[2593 池小橙 neutral]]
[Body Strengthening Potion exchanged successfully for 800 Emotion Points] [[2594 系统 neutral]]
A dark red potion appeared in her hand. [[2595 旁白 neutral]]
Small permanent improvement to physical condition. [[2596 旁白 neutral]]
Without hesitation, Chi Xiaocheng drank it down. [[2597 旁白 neutral]]
She felt a warmth flow from her stomach throughout her body. She exhaled a breath of stale air and looked at the system panel. [[2598 旁白 neutral]]
[Host: Chi Xiaocheng] [[2599 系统 neutral]]
[Age: 18] [[2600 系统 neutral]]
[Physical State: Sickly → Sub-healthy] [[2601 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points: 533] [[2602 系统 neutral]]
[Skills: Acting (Intermediate), Pain Reduction (Intermediate), Hacking (Intermediate), Surface Recovery (Intermediate), Liquid Enhancement (Basic), Cat Eyes (Basic)] [[2603 系统 neutral]]
With 533 points remaining, Chi Xiaocheng decided to save up. [[2604 旁白 neutral]]
She had her eye on something good in the system shop. [[2605 旁白 neutral]]
[Status Glasses (3000 Emotion Points): Wearing the glasses shows others' feelings and attitudes toward the host in numerical and text format. The glasses can be upgraded with Emotion Points] [[2606 系统 neutral]]
This was a good thing. [[2607 旁白 neutral]]
It was just too expensive. [[2608 旁白 neutral]]
"Everything really costs Emotion Points!" [[2609 池小橙 neutral]]
Closing the system panel, Chi Xiaocheng spread her legs and lay on the bed in a "big" character position. [[2610 旁白 neutral]]
After lying in the hospital too much, she couldn't sleep at home. [[2611 旁白 neutral]]
She picked up her phone again and looked at the social media post she had just made. A bunch of people had already replied. [[2612 旁白 neutral]]
Xiu Hua: "Xiaocheng, why are you posting on social media without makeup again? Without some powder, your face looks a bit zombie-pale. Didn't you get the makeup I gave you? Come to school tomorrow and I'll do your makeup beautifully." [[2613 秀花 neutral]]
Soda Water: "@Xiu Hua, how disgusting. Are you jealous of her bare face? So it was you who taught Xiaocheng to do that terrible makeup before. Having a friend like you is really unlucky." [[2614 苏打水 angry]]
Xiu Hua: "How dare you talk like that? What does a smelly man like you know about girls?" [[2615 秀花 angry]]
Kun Kun: "Cute." [[2616 坤坤 happy]]
Yang: "Can't even take photos properly, so stupid." [[2617 阳 neutral]]
Want to be Xiaocheng's dog: "@Yang, Young Master Dongfang, when are you going to eat that three pounds of poop you said you'd eat if Xiaocheng looked good without makeup?" [[2618 想当小橙的狗 happy]]
Yang: "???" [[2619 阳 neutral]]
Looking at the lively comments, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but laugh out loud. [[2620 旁白 happy]]
Although she had deleted Dongfang Yang's previous reply, the boomerang still came back at him! [[2621 旁白 happy]]
Seeing that Su Tao hadn't replied to her message, Chi Xiaocheng turned off her phone and fell into a deep sleep. [[2622 旁白 neutral]]
The next morning, Chi Xiaocheng woke up feeling completely refreshed. [[2623 旁白 neutral]]
Taking the medicine really made a difference. Usually, her chest would ache when she got up, but now it was much better. [[2624 旁白 neutral]]
Today was Friday. [[2625 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't go to school. She'd go check out Dongfang Yang's coffee shop first. According to what he said, she should start working as soon as she got out of the hospital. [[2626 旁白 neutral]]
After brushing her teeth and washing up, having oatmeal and eggs for breakfast, Chi Xiaocheng put on an extra light blue hoodie and headed out. [[2627 旁白 neutral]]
"Whew, it's still a bit cold. I need to save money to buy a cotton coat." [[2628 池小橙 neutral]]
Feeling the outdoor temperature, Chi Xiaocheng rubbed her hands together. The warm breath from her mouth was already visible as little white puffs. [[2629 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving the residential area, greeting Uncle Zhang at the gate, Chi Xiaocheng walked straight toward the school entrance. [[2630 旁白 neutral]]
"Moon Cafe, that's a nice name. North Street near the school isn't far either. I just don't know what the situation is like... hmm?" [[2631 池小橙 neutral]]
Just as she reached the school gate, Chi Xiaocheng squinted her eyes slightly. [[2632 旁白 neutral]]
Outside a bubble tea shop at the gate, Su Tao was chatting with a boy. She was looking down, kicking pebbles with her toes, looking troubled. [[2633 旁白 neutral]]
"That person is Si Chen, right? Another male lead from the novel. Did he find Su Tao, or did Su Tao find him?" [[2634 池小橙 neutral]]
