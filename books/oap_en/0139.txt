Chapter 139: A Sudden Yandere Turn, the Situation Takes a Sharp Decline [[12233 旁白 neutral]]
Early morning. [[12234 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt incredibly refreshed after a good night's sleep. [[12235 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm~" [[12236 苏桃 neutral]]
Wearing a slightly thin nightgown, Su Tao sat up with her hands folded, letting out an alluring sound. [[12237 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out to touch the bed, but didn't feel the warm, soft hair that was like a kitten's. [[12238 旁白 neutral]]
Wait, she did feel a cat. [[12239 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lifted the covers and saw Da Wang comfortably squinting its eyes, its little tail wagging contentedly. [[12240 旁白 neutral]]
But this cat wasn't what she wanted to see. [[12241 旁白 neutral]]
"Where's Xiaocheng?" [[12242 苏桃 neutral]]
"She actually woke up earlier than me, how rare." [[12243 苏桃 neutral]]
Usually, even if Xiaocheng was already awake when she woke up, she would snuggle into her arms and just stare at her face. [[12244 旁白 neutral]]
With a faint, loving smile on her face. [[12245 旁白 neutral]]
"What time is it now?" [[12246 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao reached for her phone and saw the two-person figurine on the nearby table. [[12247 旁白 neutral]]
The one in the black formal dress was aggressively overpowering Chi Xiaocheng in the white princess dress. [[12248 旁白 neutral]]
Every time she looked at it, she felt as if the figurine was about to come to life. [[12249 旁白 neutral]]
"I should ask Xiaocheng about this figurine, that black dress doesn't really suit me." [[12250 苏桃 neutral]]
Getting out of bed, Su Tao put a hair tie in her mouth and ran her fingers through her long hair while looking for Chi Xiaocheng. [[12251 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't in the living room, but the air conditioner, which was turned off before bed last night, was already on. [[12252 旁白 neutral]]
Apparently, Chi Xiaocheng had woken up very early. [[12253 旁白 neutral]]
Was she in... the kitchen? [[12254 旁白 neutral]]
A trickling sound from the kitchen reached Su Tao's ears. It was a faint sound, but very noticeable in the quiet living room. [[12255 旁白 neutral]]
She walked to the kitchen and saw the small figure with her back to her, busy with something. [[12256 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, what are you doing?" [[12257 苏桃 neutral]]
"Pouring some liquor." [[12258 池小橙 neutral]]
"Liquor?" [[12259 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly turned around, a gentle, loving smile on her lips, just like always. [[12260 旁白 neutral]]
But her eyes were incredibly strange. [[12261 旁白 neutral]]
Her cat-like vertical pupils were full of aggression and glowed with a faint red light. [[12262 旁白 neutral]]
It was a sharp contrast to the gentle smile on her lips. [[12263 旁白 neutral]]
But it didn't feel out of place at all. [[12264 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao even had a feeling that the Chi Xiaocheng in front of her was the real Xiaocheng! [[12265 旁白 neutral]]
But what was more frightening wasn't her expression, but the hand she revealed as she turned. [[12266 旁白 neutral]]
She was holding a bottle of white liquor, pouring it into a glass. [[12267 旁白 neutral]]
Drinking liquor... in the middle of winter? [[12268 旁白 neutral]]
The splashing sound continued. [[12269 旁白 neutral]]
With a "splash," a drop of liquor fell straight to the floor. [[12270 旁白 neutral]]
It hit, splashed, and scattered, as if trying to paint a rose on the floor tiles. [[12271 旁白 neutral]]
As she turned, her other hand, which had been suspended in the air, stopped over the glass. [[12272 旁白 neutral]]
The glass was full of liquor. [[12273 旁白 neutral]]
A typical glass holds 250ml. [[12274 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng was clearly nearing the end of pouring. Remembering the burning, harsh feeling in her throat, Su Tao couldn't help but feel a little scared. [[12275 旁白 sad]]
She stood sideways, and the creepy scene reflected in Su Tao's eyes made the faint smile on her lips freeze completely. [[12276 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, you're up. Did you sleep well last night?" [[12277 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice, as sweet as ever, reached Su Tao's ears. [[12278 旁白 neutral]]
It should have been cute and comforting. [[12279 旁白 neutral]]
For those who have a thing for voices, it was heavenly. [[12280 旁白 neutral]]
But to Su Tao's ears, it was incredibly jarring. [[12281 旁白 neutral]]
Woke up? [[12282 旁白 neutral]]
Slept well? [[12283 旁白 neutral]]
Last night, she was so well-behaved, sleeping peacefully in her arms. Xiaocheng hadn't been upset at all, so why did she change like this after just one night? [[12284 旁白 sad]]
Did she have a nightmare? [[12285 旁白 neutral]]
From well-behaved to yandere again. [[12286 旁白 neutral]]
No, no, no, no, no! [[12287 旁白 angry]]
This probably wasn't caused by being upset, it was completely different from her usual dark transformations! [[12288 旁白 neutral]]
The way she looked now, it was more like... [[12289 旁白 neutral]]
She was voluntarily showing her yandere side. [[12290 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she were whispering to her, "The me you see now is the real me~" [[12291 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's just-awakened brain hadn't adjusted yet. Her mind was full of reasons why Chi Xiaocheng might have changed, but she couldn't accept what she was seeing. [[12292 旁白 sad]]
She still wanted the well-behaved Xiaocheng. [[12293 旁白 sad]]
But... [[12294 旁白 sad]]
It seemed that Xiaocheng was gone. [[12295 旁白 sad]]
She repeated her earlier question almost unconsciously, "Xiaocheng... what are you doing?" [[12296 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng swirled the liquor in the glass. [[12297 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled faintly, "Didn't Taotao say you were afraid of the cold winter? How about some liquor to warm you up?" [[12298 池小橙 happy]]
"That's... not right, is it?" [[12299 苏桃 sad]]
"Hmm?" Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head, "What's not right? I listen to you, so you should listen to me. But why do you always seem to reject me?" [[12300 池小橙 sad]]
"You really don't like me anymore, do you?" [[12301 池小橙 sad]]
A glass of liquor was held out in front of her. [[12302 旁白 neutral]]
"If Taotao gets drunk, I wonder if you'll tell me the truth?" [[12303 池小橙 happy]]
When Su Tao finally realized what was happening, her back was already drenched in a cold sweat. [[12304 旁白 sad]]
Drinking? [[12305 旁白 neutral]]
No, the more important thing now was that Xiaocheng had turned yandere again! [[12306 旁白 sad]]
And without any warning! [[12307 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao snatched the glass, slammed it on the counter, then grabbed Chi Xiaocheng's hand and started to drag her toward the living room, "Come with me first!" [[12308 苏桃 angry]]
"Come with you?" Chi Xiaocheng's voice grew faint, "To do what?" [[12309 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao's pupils contracted. She realized she couldn't move Chi Xiaocheng at all! [[12310 旁白 neutral]]
The girl who was usually so delicate was now stronger than her. [[12311 旁白 neutral]]
She was getting anxious and couldn't accept Chi Xiaocheng acting like this in front of her. She yelled, "Xiaocheng, what are you thinking? I've always said I like you, and when have I ever rejected you!" [[12312 苏桃 angry]]
But Chi Xiaocheng just replied coldly, "When you say you like me, do you mean the 'like' you've been faking?" [[12313 池小橙 angry]]
"What—?" [[12314 苏桃 sad]]
"I've said it before." Chi Xiaocheng shook her hand free from Su Tao's grasp, "In that suicide note, I said I could feel you were just going through the motions. Even after I woke up, you still haven't changed." [[12315 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao took a step back, explaining frantically, "That's not it, I've already..." [[12316 苏桃 sad]]
I'm already forcing myself to fall in love with you! [[12317 旁白 neutral]]
However, before she could finish, she was cut off by Chi Xiaocheng's shout, "What are you trying to brush me off with an explanation again!" [[12318 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng was very emotional. [[12319 旁白 neutral]]
Her vertical pupils didn't hide the possessiveness and regret within them. [[12320 旁白 neutral]]
The situation had taken a sharp, sudden turn that was impossible to react to, and Su Tao's heart sank. [[12321 旁白 sad]]
It wasn't that she hadn't considered the possibility that Chi Xiaocheng would be disappointed, angry, resentful, or even turn into a yandere after waking up. [[12322 旁白 sad]]
It was just delayed. [[12323 旁白 neutral]]
During her hospital stay, she had been hiding her emotions. [[12324 旁白 neutral]]
She was probably holding onto one last hope. [[12325 旁白 sad]]
She couldn't feel genuine affection from her. [[12326 旁白 sad]]
And so, that hope was shattered. [[12327 旁白 sad]]
