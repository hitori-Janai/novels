Chapter 137: You'll definitely like this, right? [[12030 旁白 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[12031 苏桃 neutral]]
Hearing Chi Xiaocheng's words, Su Tao had a bad feeling. [[12032 旁白 neutral]]
Black tea... it couldn't be the same as last time, could it! [[12033 苏桃 sad]]
She remembered the last time she drank black tea, Chi Xiaocheng had added computer parts to it right in front of her. [[12034 旁白 neutral]]
This time, surely she wouldn't... [[12035 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao shook her head, quickly reassuring herself. It definitely wouldn't happen this time. After all, Xiaocheng had changed, hadn't she? [[12036 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng noticed Su Tao shaking her head. "Hm? Is there a problem, or does Taotao not like it?" [[12037 池小橙 neutral]]
"Not really, I just feel more like eating fruit." [[12038 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao immediately put on a smile. [[12039 旁白 neutral]]
She already knew that Chi Xiaocheng had an unusual obsession with the word "like." It was the most important trigger for her yandere side! [[12040 旁白 neutral]]
If anything went against her wishes, she might snap. [[12041 旁白 neutral]]
When that word was mentioned, Su Tao knew she had no other choice. [[12042 旁白 neutral]]
Carefully avoiding the issue was a lesson she had learned from last time. [[12043 旁白 neutral]]
She watched as Chi Xiaocheng put down Da Wang and went back into the kitchen. [[12044 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced over and felt a sudden palpitation. [[12045 旁白 neutral]]
She instinctively turned to the kitchen and called out, "Xiaocheng!" [[12046 苏桃 neutral]]
"What's wrong?" [[12047 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice sounded puzzled, and the juicer could be heard running inside. [[12048 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Su Tao breathed a sigh of relief. [[12049 旁白 neutral]]
What was that? It really scared her. [[12050 旁白 neutral]]
"Here you go~" [[12051 池小橙 happy]]
A peeled apple was handed to Su Tao. [[12052 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took it and noticed the apple was cool, clearly just taken from the refrigerator. [[12053 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed Xiaocheng was quite obedient after all. [[12054 旁白 neutral]]
It really was fruit; she had thought it would be something else. [[12055 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since Chi Xiaocheng became so well-behaved, she hadn't forced her to do anything. [[12056 旁白 neutral]]
Wait. [[12057 苏桃 neutral]]
Well-behaved? [[12058 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up at the smiling Chi Xiaocheng, whose face was close to hers, her delicate skin perfectly clear. [[12059 旁白 neutral]]
Wasn't Xiaocheng this well-behaved right before she had her episode on the bridge? [[12060 旁白 neutral]]
Hiding that yandere side behind a disguise of "well-behaved." [[12061 旁白 neutral]]
Speaking of which, Xiaocheng had written a suicide note and was extremely disappointed in her. [[12062 旁白 neutral]]
The words in the note made her own thoughts clear. [[12063 旁白 neutral]]
—I am no longer your Xiaocheng. [[12064 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, that was the signature after "Good night." [[12065 旁白 neutral]]
The word "your" had been clearly crossed out. [[12066 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, not knowing if Chi Xiaocheng would ever wake up, that final sentence had made her heart ache with regret. [[12067 旁白 neutral]]
Those few short words were a constant reminder. [[12068 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, Xiaocheng belonged to you. [[12069 旁白 neutral]]
Now, Xiaocheng has nothing to do with you, and you will never see her again! [[12070 旁白 neutral]]
But what happened after Chi Xiaocheng actually woke up? [[12071 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had prepared for Chi Xiaocheng to try to harm herself again, to be in heartbreaking pain, to hit her, to curse her for her "betrayal," or to continue showing her yandere side. [[12072 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was mentally prepared for the worst possible outcomes. [[12073 旁白 neutral]]
But when she actually woke up, she was just sulky for three days. It seemed like she didn't like her anymore, but she secretly still cared. [[12074 旁白 neutral]]
Her sulking wasn't scary at all. [[12075 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, it showed a cuteness different from her usual obedient self. [[12076 旁白 neutral]]
After all, it was like she was pouting. [[12077 旁白 neutral]]
These past few days, Su Tao had been so happy about Chi Xiaocheng's recovery and busy catching up on things she had missed due to her own illness that she hadn't thought about it carefully. [[12078 旁白 neutral]]
Why was Xiaocheng so desperate that she wanted to end her life? [[12079 旁白 neutral]]
But after waking up, her emotions were as stable as a normal person's, and she didn't mention anything about what happened before. [[12080 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even ask about Xiao Ming or the marriage certificate, nor did she ask who attacked her that night! [[12081 旁白 neutral]]
Only when they were alone would she bring it up casually. [[12082 旁白 neutral]]
Realizing this now, so late. [[12083 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly felt countless inconsistencies rush towards her. [[12084 旁白 neutral]]
All the things she hadn't thought about before now surfaced in her mind. [[12085 旁白 neutral]]
Has Xiaocheng really become normal? [[12086 旁白 neutral]]
She's even more well-behaved than she was half a month ago! [[12087 旁白 neutral]]
The living room, once filled with warm light and comfortable from the air conditioning, slowly grew dim and distorted in Su Tao's eyes. [[12088 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang was being held by Chi Xiaocheng. [[12089 旁白 neutral]]
Its eerie, vertical pupils seemed to glow green. [[12090 旁白 neutral]]
Looking up again, Chi Xiaocheng's pupils became vertical like Da Wang's, and her smile grew more bizarre and unsettling. [[12091 旁白 neutral]]
The apple in her hand... gradually began to rot. [[12092 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao shivered. [[12093 旁白 neutral]]
She squeezed her eyes shut. [[12094 旁白 neutral]]
When she opened them, she saw Chi Xiaocheng tilting her head in surprise, asking with concern, "What's wrong, Taotao?" [[12095 池小橙 neutral]]
The Chi Xiaocheng in front of her, although her pupils were a tiny bit strange, was the definition of cute. [[12096 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang was just staring curiously at the apple. [[12097 旁白 neutral]]
The living room hadn't changed at all. [[12098 旁白 neutral]]
Was what I just saw a hallucination? [[12099 苏桃 neutral]]
Cold sweat broke out on Su Tao's back, and she gently patted her chest. [[12100 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe she was just too stressed and nervous. [[12101 旁白 neutral]]
Meeting Chi Xiaocheng's gaze, Su Tao had a faint feeling that although the girl was very well-behaved... [[12102 旁白 neutral]]
She could feel Chi Xiaocheng's overwhelming love from this single piece of fruit. [[12103 旁白 neutral]]
If she didn't eat this fruit, if she didn't say she liked it, she might have a deeper, more terrifying reaction. [[12104 旁白 neutral]]
Remembering a certain uncomfortable night, Su Tao's toes instinctively gripped the floor. [[12105 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't done anything or said anything, but why did she always feel pressure from Xiaocheng's eyes? [[12106 旁白 angry]]
I really hate this feeling! [[12107 苏桃 angry]]
Of course, she didn't know that Chi Xiaocheng's "cat eyes" skill affected everyone, friend or foe, causing pressure and fear. [[12108 旁白 neutral]]
In this situation, I have to eat this apple, right? [[12109 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng will definitely jump to conclusions! [[12110 苏桃 sad]]
It's hard to imagine that a single apple could make someone sweat so much. [[12111 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao would rather eat salty tofu pudding than this thing. [[12112 旁白 neutral]]
By the way, she preferred sweet. [[12113 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao tried her best to control her expression, took a bite, and forced a smile. "Hahaha... it's delicious." [[12114 苏桃 happy]]
She didn't realize that the hand holding the apple was trembling slightly. [[12115 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even notice that Chi Xiaocheng's smile grew wider. [[12116 旁白 neutral]]
At least it's not something else, Su Tao thought. [[12117 旁白 neutral]]
I just have to bear with it. [[12118 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, she didn't like it. [[12119 旁白 neutral]]
She even found it disgusting. [[12120 旁白 neutral]]
But, I'll just humor Xiaocheng for now. [[12121 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng chuckled softly. "That's great, Taotao likes it just like me. Let's peel an orange after dinner." [[12122 池小橙 happy]]
"An orange?" [[12123 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned. "Xiao... Xiaocheng, are... are there a lot of fruits?" [[12124 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's not that there's a lot of fruit, but I was thinking about the next three days, so I prepared a little bit of everything." [[12125 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked to the refrigerator and deliberately opened the door wide, taking out ingredients for dinner. [[12126 旁白 neutral]]
She said intentionally, "What should we have for dinner tonight? Taotao usually decides, so it's a bit hard for me to choose." [[12127 池小橙 neutral]]
Suddenly, what appeared before Su Tao's eyes was... [[12128 旁白 neutral]]
Besides all kinds of fruit, there were bottles of cold drinks, ice water, and beer, all radiating cold air. [[12129 旁白 neutral]]
It was clearly winter, and these things didn't need to be in the fridge, but they were all thrown in there. Drinking them would be bone-chilling. [[12130 旁白 neutral]]
She swallowed hard, her lips turning a little pale. [[12131 旁白 neutral]]
She remembered a day in the past when all the food was a mix of sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, and salty, and had a disgusting rotten smell. [[12132 旁白 neutral]]
