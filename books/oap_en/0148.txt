Chapter 148: The Original Ending [[13036 旁白 neutral]]
She cleaned herself up and tidied her appearance. [[13037 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng covered her scarred face, feeling a mix of nervousness, anticipation, and resentment toward Ye Liang, as she arrived at Su Tao's hospital room. [[13038 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang stood beside her, leaning in and threatening, "You know what to say and what not to say. Because you hurt her, her recovery doesn't look good." [[13039 叶良 angry]]
"If she gets angry or upset, the worst could happen!" [[13040 叶良 angry]]
"And I can choose not to save her. If you cooperate this time, I might consider letting you go." [[13041 叶良 angry]]
In the dream, Chi Xiaocheng pressed her lips together, looked at Ye Liang, and nodded firmly. [[13042 旁白 neutral]]
But for Su Tao, who was just an observer, it was heartbreaking to watch. [[13043 旁白 sad]]
"No, Xiaocheng! Ye Liang is lying, don't agree to it!" [[13044 苏桃 sad]]
But no matter how much she yelled, the dream was just a dream. [[13045 旁白 sad]]
And she was just an observer. [[13046 旁白 neutral]]
The Chi Xiaocheng inside the dream couldn't hear her words at all. [[13047 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how she reached out, Chi Xiaocheng had already walked into the hospital room. [[13048 旁白 sad]]
After a long time, she met the dream version of Su Tao again. [[13049 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the haggard look on the person in the hospital bed, Chi Xiaocheng panicked, her mind a mess, and she didn't know where to start with what she had planned to say. [[13050 旁白 sad]]
She stammered like a child who had done something wrong. [[13051 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she was about to speak, she saw Su Tao hurriedly turn to the side, seemingly ashamed of her scarred face and unwilling to let anyone see it. [[13052 旁白 neutral]]
A cool voice slowly sounded, "What are you still doing here?" [[13053 苏桃 sad]]
The thousands of words she wanted to say were caught in her throat. [[13054 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up, and from under her hood, the light in her eyes seemed to be fading. [[13055 旁白 sad]]
She took a step forward and said incoherently, "Taotao, it's not like that... I didn't mean to hurt you. I just... I just wanted to protect you, I..." [[13056 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao remained turned to the side, not showing Chi Xiaocheng her face, her voice still calm, "You should go." [[13057 苏桃 sad]]
It sounded like a rejection. [[13058 旁白 sad]]
She wasn't even given a chance to explain. [[13059 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng reached out, trying to grab the shadow that had its back to her. [[13060 旁白 sad]]
But Taotao... she doesn't want to see me anymore... [[13061 池小橙 sad]]
Is there any point in holding on? [[13062 池小橙 sad]]
It will only make her sadder, only hurt her more. [[13063 池小橙 sad]]
Maybe it's best for Taotao if I just leave? [[13064 池小橙 sad]]
The outstretched hand finally dropped, limp. [[13065 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head, using her thumb and index finger to pull down her hood. [[13066 旁白 neutral]]
The brim of the hood completely covered her broken face and hid her heart. [[13067 旁白 sad]]
"I'm sorry." [[13068 池小橙 sad]]
A thousand emotions in her heart were reduced to those two words. [[13069 旁白 sad]]
She turned and walked heavily toward the door. [[13070 旁白 sad]]
Of the people present, Chi Xiaocheng left in despair, Ye Liang was grinning menacingly, and the dream Su Tao, with her back to Chi Xiaocheng, was looking at a small mirror on the counter. [[13071 旁白 neutral]]
The mirror reflected Chi Xiaocheng's lonely retreating figure. [[13072 旁白 sad]]
Only Su Tao, the observer, understood that this was all a misunderstanding. [[13073 旁白 sad]]
She went to Chi Xiaocheng, wanting to grab the girl, but her transparent hand passed right through her. [[13074 旁白 sad]]
She murmured through her tears. [[13075 旁白 sad]]
"It's not like this, it's not like this." [[13076 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng, turn around and look! Look at my face! I don't hate you, how could I ever hate you!" [[13077 苏桃 sad]]
"Can't you just turn around and say a few more words?" [[13078 苏桃 sad]]
"I just... I just didn't want you to see my scarred face. I didn't want you to feel guilty or sad. When I saw you were okay, that's why I told you to leave!" [[13079 苏桃 sad]]
"The 'me' in this dream was just afraid that if I looked at you any longer, I wouldn't be able to resist hugging you, and you would see my weak side!" [[13080 苏桃 sad]]
But no matter how loudly she shouted, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't hear. [[13081 旁白 sad]]
She had reached the door and looked back one last time at the figure by the bed. [[13082 旁白 sad]]
"The 'me' in the dream, the me by the bed, turn around... turn around!" [[13083 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng is looking at us, she needs us!" [[13084 苏桃 sad]]
Tears blurred her vision, and her voice grew hoarse. [[13085 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's last hope turned into true despair. [[13086 旁白 sad]]
That last look back was a final farewell. [[13087 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao couldn't change the course of the dream; Chi Xiaocheng had already left with Ye Liang. [[13088 旁白 sad]]
Then, from just outside the door, a scream was heard. [[13089 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao rushed out the door and saw that Chi Xiaocheng had somehow pulled out a small knife and was stabbing it ferociously into Ye Liang's side. [[13090 旁白 angry]]
It looked like she wanted to take him down with her. [[13091 旁白 angry]]
But Ye Liang was a strong and healthy adult man, while she was a malnourished, sleep-deprived, sickly girl. [[13092 旁白 neutral]]
Like an enraged lion, Ye Liang clutched his side and swept her legs, knocking her aside. [[13093 旁白 angry]]
By the time the dream Su Tao reached the door after hearing the noise, Ye Liang was clutching his stomach in pain. [[13094 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, like a criminal who had succeeded, fled the scene. [[13095 旁白 neutral]]
"I knew she'd never change. Her obedience was all an act. She just tried to kill me!" [[13096 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang, taking advantage of his injury, continued to manipulate the dream Su Tao's thoughts. "Su Tao, is this your so-called best friend? I've been so good to you, to her. I even forgave her, gave her food, clothes, and a place to stay, and she still tried to kill me!" [[13097 叶良 angry]]
Every word was like a nail driving into the dream Su Tao's heart. [[13098 旁白 sad]]
The vibrating nails told her that this was no longer the Xiaocheng she knew. [[13099 旁白 sad]]
Memories of months of mutual hostility due to misunderstandings flooded her mind, finally stopping at the dark room. [[13100 旁白 sad]]
The knife stabbing her cheek, stabbing her chest. [[13101 旁白 sad]]
The pain was carved into her soul. [[13102 旁白 sad]]
Under Ye Liang's guidance, a look of disappointment slowly crept onto the dream Su Tao's face. [[13103 旁白 sad]]
No matter how loudly the real Su Tao, the observer, shouted from the side, she couldn't wake up the her who had been blinded. [[13104 旁白 sad]]
In the end, she could only look at Ye Liang with resentment. [[13105 旁白 sad]]
Looking at this hypocrite she once thought was a decent person. [[13106 旁白 sad]]
The dream continued, and Xiaocheng and Taotao had become two parallel lines that would never cross again. [[13107 旁白 sad]]
Once injured, Ye Liang no longer bothered to hide his true nature and began a full-scale hunt for Chi Xiaocheng. [[13108 旁白 angry]]
The events in the dream were the complete opposite of reality. [[13109 旁白 neutral]]
In reality, Dongfang Yang, who had a good relationship with Chi Xiaocheng, was one of those who disliked her in the dream. [[13110 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen, who would occasionally speak up for Chi Xiaocheng, wouldn't interfere in this "farce" either. [[13111 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian and Xiao Wei, who were on her side, knew nothing as ordinary people. [[13112 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng didn't have many friends to begin with. [[13113 旁白 sad]]
Without Su Tao. [[13114 旁白 sad]]
It was as if she had been abandoned by the whole world. [[13115 旁白 sad]]
She struggled to survive but was eventually caught by Ye Liang. [[13116 旁白 sad]]
Through violence and abuse, Ye Liang tried to force Chi Xiaocheng to write a suicide note for Su Tao, but she knew he was just trying to use her. [[13117 旁白 sad]]
No matter how much it hurt, she never begged for mercy. [[13118 旁白 sad]]
In the very end, she was beaten until she was on the verge of death, barely recognizable. [[13119 旁白 sad]]
The dream Su Tao, realizing things too late, began searching for the missing Chi Xiaocheng. [[13120 旁白 sad]]
The clues eventually led to one of Ye Liang's underlings. [[13121 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could no longer be hidden, so she was thrown into the sea to drown. [[13122 旁白 sad]]
After all, she was just an unwanted stray cat hiding in a trash heap. [[13123 旁白 sad]]
