Chapter 194: It's a Doll, Not Xiaocheng [[16990 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, you're breaking the rules." [[16991 系统 neutral]]
"Hmm? How am I breaking the rules?" [[16992 池小橙 neutral]]
"Su Tao was just starting to feel better, and now you're giving her another suicide note. She'll probably just keep feeling guilty." [[16993 系统 neutral]]
"Don't worry. The Su Tao of today won't be depressed like before. She has started to like me, and she'll live a good life for my sake." [[16994 池小橙 happy]]
The scarecrow sat obediently on the table, meeting Su Tao's eyes without minding at all. [[16995 旁白 neutral]]
As long as it remained perfectly still, no one would guess that a person's soul was hidden inside the little doll. [[16996 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng continued her conversation with the System in her mind, "I have no choice. I must make Taotao take me to the birthday banquet to see that 'miracle doctor' male lead. If that protagonist dares to have any ideas about Taotao..." [[16997 池小橙 neutral]]
A red glint suddenly flashed in the scarecrow's eyes. [[16998 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll disguise myself and kill him!" [[16999 池小橙 angry]]
Taotao can only be mine, no one else can touch her! [[17000 池小橙 angry]]
"Host, do you know what others would say about your behavior?" [[17001 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Hmm?" [[17002 池小橙 neutral]]
"Full of tricks." [[17003 系统 neutral]]
"Being full of tricks is cute too. Thanks for the compliment." [[17004 池小橙 happy]]
She remained obediently and quietly on the table, not moving at all. [[17005 旁白 neutral]]
But this "Suicide Note 2.0," which she spent 100 Emotion Points to design, was about to change the power dynamic in this house. [[17006 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang was a cat, much more sensitive than humans. [[17007 旁白 neutral]]
It had probably long since smelled Chi Xiaocheng's "scent" on the scarecrow, which was why it played with her every day. [[17008 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as Su Tao came back, it would carry the doll over to her side. [[17009 旁白 neutral]]
It actually knew that Su Tao missed her very much. [[17010 旁白 neutral]]
It resonated with her emotions. [[17011 旁白 neutral]]
That's why it always did this, carrying the doll over to tell her that she was still alive, to make her happier. [[17012 旁白 neutral]]
Cats are so smart! [[17013 旁白 happy]]
But that's absolutely no reason for you to toss me around in the air all the time! [[17014 池小橙 angry]]
In her view, Da Wang sneaked into the room again, its round little eyes glancing left and right. [[17015 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing her sitting properly on the table, its face lit up with joy. [[17016 旁白 neutral]]
It jumped onto the table in a few quick movements. [[17017 旁白 neutral]]
It was just about to bat Chi Xiaocheng with its paw. [[17018 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao, holding the paper, glared at it and said, "Da Wang, stop!" [[17019 苏桃 angry]]
"Meow?" [[17020 大王 neutral]]
Da Wang looked at Su Tao in confusion, then lightly batted Chi Xiaocheng onto the floor. [[17021 旁白 neutral]]
Just as it was about to jump down and get it, it found itself caught by another hand. [[17022 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao wiped away a tear and pointed at Da Wang's innocent eyes, "This is Xiaocheng's comfort object. I understand you like it, but don't bully this doll again, okay?" [[17023 苏桃 sad]]
"Meow meow!" [[17024 大王 neutral]]
Da Wang shook its head, showing it didn't understand. [[17025 旁白 neutral]]
Then Su Tao threw it out of the room. "You're not sleeping in your bed tonight, and no fish snacks for you. Stay outside and think about what you've done!" [[17026 苏桃 angry]]
"Meow?!" [[17027 大王 sad]]
Da Wang wanted to resist, but the door slammed shut with a "bang." [[17028 旁白 neutral]]
The little tabby cat pawed at the door from outside, a look of disbelief slowly appearing on its face. [[17029 旁白 neutral]]
When you were sad, I was the one who kept you company. [[17030 大王 sad]]
Just now, you were petting my head and calling me cute. [[17031 大王 sad]]
And now you— [[17032 大王 angry]]
Hmph, humans! [[17033 大王 angry]]
Su Tao didn't know what the cat was thinking. After placing the little Chi Xiaocheng doll back on the table, she read the second suicide note several more times. [[17034 旁白 neutral]]
Although it was a fake that Chi Xiaocheng had created yesterday with Emotion Points. [[17035 旁白 neutral]]
But in Su Tao's eyes, this was left behind from Chi Xiaocheng's first suicide attempt. [[17036 旁白 neutral]]
It was incredibly meaningful to her. [[17037 旁白 neutral]]
She put it away carefully, then collected herself and went to take a shower. [[17038 旁白 neutral]]
Afterward, she sat leaning against the headboard, using an old tablet she bought from a second-hand website to study the etiquette for high-society banquets. [[17039 旁白 neutral]]
Usually, a cat would be cuddled on her chest, but since Da Wang was kicked out, Su Tao looked around. [[17040 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze lingered on the big brown bear pillow for a few seconds. [[17041 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed to feel something. [[17042 旁白 neutral]]
Then her eyes moved to the scarecrow doll. [[17043 旁白 neutral]]
She placed the small, palm-sized doll in front of her and started watching the video to learn. [[17044 旁白 neutral]]
Sure enough, having this little doll nearby gave her a special sense of security. [[17045 旁白 neutral]]
Just like the sachet before. [[17046 旁白 neutral]]
Wearing it, with the faint scent of orange from Xiaocheng, always helped her fall asleep quickly. [[17047 旁白 neutral]]
Eating, sleeping, going out for exercise, and besides studying in her free time, she would also spend two or three hours at the hospital. [[17048 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's routine for the next two days passed quickly. [[17049 旁白 neutral]]
And the doll, representing her hope, stayed by her side for longer and longer. [[17050 旁白 neutral]]
16 days left until the official revival. [[17051 旁白 neutral]]
On Saturday afternoon, Su Tao received a call from Dongfang Yang. "Are you ready? I've sent someone to pick you up. Come to my place first, I have a few gowns for you." [[17052 东方阳 happy]]
"Okay, okay." [[17053 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao had been studying for days and was already prepared for today's banquet. Hearing Dongfang Yang's call, she immediately lifted Da Wang off her lap. [[17054 旁白 neutral]]
She slung a small bag over her shoulder and got up to leave. [[17055 旁白 neutral]]
However, just as she turned, she felt a breeze from the balcony that didn't just hit her neck. [[17056 旁白 neutral]]
It also blew the scarecrow from the table onto the floor. [[17057 旁白 neutral]]
A soft "thud" caught Su Tao's attention. [[17058 旁白 neutral]]
She turned and met the scarecrow's eyes. The pair of crimson pupils instantly gave her a sense of unease. [[17059 旁白 neutral]]
The scarecrow was just half-lying on the ground, its face and gaze turned towards her because of how it fell. [[17060 旁白 neutral]]
But its crystal-like eyes seemed to be sending a message to Su Tao. [[17061 旁白 neutral]]
—Aren't you taking me with you, Taotao? [[17062 池小橙 sad]]
For some reason, Su Tao felt that something bad would happen if she went to the banquet like this. [[17063 旁白 neutral]]
If she took this little doll with her... [[17064 旁白 neutral]]
She walked over, and a sense of peace came from the doll. [[17065 旁白 neutral]]
The faint feeling of unease disappeared. [[17066 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes, you really have to trust your sixth sense. [[17067 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao recalled the contents of the letter from last night. [[17068 旁白 neutral]]
"A doll that brings good luck?" [[17069 苏桃 neutral]]
She murmured, then smiled with relief, "Right, how can I go to a banquet without bringing Xiaocheng? Let's go together." [[17070 苏桃 happy]]
With that, she put the scarecrow doll into her bag. [[17071 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang, who had wanted to follow, was pushed aside with disdain. [[17072 旁白 neutral]]
The slight sense of crisis and unease in her heart completely vanished at that moment. [[17073 旁白 neutral]]
She walked out of the residential complex, waited for Dongfang Yang's person to pick her up, and then went to a small villa where he lived. [[17074 旁白 neutral]]
When she entered, Su Tao saw two other familiar faces. [[17075 旁白 neutral]]
Qian Qing and Si Chen. [[17076 旁白 neutral]]
The two had already changed into their formal wear. Qian Qing wore a light blue, off-the-shoulder, waist-cinching dress. High heels and light makeup perfectly showcased her stunning figure and beauty. [[17077 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen was much more reserved, wearing an expensive suit with subtle details. [[17078 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was different, wearing a fiery red coat like a battle robe, looking bold and arrogant. [[17079 旁白 neutral]]
He strode out from the doorway, instantly capturing everyone's attention. [[17080 旁白 neutral]]
The moment he opened his mouth, his bold aura instantly became cheerful and honest, "Hahaha, Su Tao, you're finally here! Don't you think I'm more handsome than Si Chen?" [[17081 东方阳 happy]]
Si Chen covered his face, looking like he didn't want to talk to an idiot. [[17082 旁白 neutral]]
He turned to Su Tao, "You should go change into your gown too. We'll leave once you're ready." [[17083 司辰 neutral]]
"Okay." [[17084 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded and handed her bag to Si Chen, "Can you hold this for me?" [[17085 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen took the bag and felt that it was bulging, as if something was moving inside. He asked curiously, "What do you have in here?" [[17086 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao: "A doll that Xiaocheng gave me before. It's very cute, you can take a look." [[17087 苏桃 happy]]
Curious, Si Chen unzipped the bag. [[17088 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a scarecrow doll with eyes glowing with a faint, eerie red light emerged from the bag. With a friendly smile, it stared at Si Chen without moving. [[17089 旁白 neutral]]
