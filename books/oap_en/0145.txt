Chapter 145: Misunderstanding [[12764 旁白 neutral]]
"Hum hum hum~ Hum hum hum~" [[12765 旁白 neutral]]
Along with the vibration, Su Tao's phone ringtone woke her from her exhausted sleep. [[12766 旁白 neutral]]
The moment she heard the ringtone, Su Tao leaped out of bed, her body tense. [[12767 旁白 sad]]
Her phone ringtone wasn't like a WeChat notification, not a specific song or a melody, but something from a long time ago, from when she had just started high school. [[12768 旁白 neutral]]
One time, when she woke up, she overheard Chi Xiaocheng humming a song. [[12769 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice was delicate and clear, as refreshing as a lark's song. Not wanting to disturb Chi Xiaocheng, she hid and secretly recorded the melody she was humming, along with the sound of the wind. [[12770 旁白 neutral]]
Whenever someone called, even if it was just an ad or a scam call, it would calm her down and make her think of the simple and happy times back in the countryside. [[12771 旁白 happy]]
And the best version of her in those memories. [[12772 旁白 happy]]
In the original novel, this song also gave Su Tao the courage to persevere through difficult times. [[12773 旁白 neutral]]
But now, hearing this ringtone, Su Tao felt as if Chi Xiaocheng was standing in front of her, humming a farewell song while holding the fruit knife stained red with orange juice. [[12774 旁白 sad]]
It was terrifying and frightening. [[12775 旁白 sad]]
After quickly calming down as the ringing continued, Su Tao looked around and, not seeing Chi Xiaocheng, finally answered the phone. [[12776 旁白 neutral]]
The contact was saved; it was a colleague from her part-time job at the snack supermarket. Like Su Tao, she was a freshman, shy and introverted, but very easy to talk to. [[12777 旁白 neutral]]
This classmate was covering her shift while she was on leave. [[12778 旁白 neutral]]
She wondered what the call was about and knew she had to answer it quickly while Xiaocheng wasn't around. [[12779 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao answered the phone. Before she could speak, her colleague's anxious voice came through, "Tao... Taozi, you finally answered! Where are you? Your 'Orange' just caused a scene at the store, there was so much of that red stuff!" [[12780 同事 sad]]
"Red stuff?" [[12781 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's head was buzzing. She threw off the covers, jumped out of bed, and immediately ran to the living room to look around. Chi Xiaocheng was nowhere to be found! [[12782 旁白 sad]]
Did she go to my workplace? [[12783 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao quickly asked, "What on earth happened?!" [[12784 苏桃 sad]]
"I... I don't know." Her colleague sounded scared. "She brought someone upstairs to the second floor to find Sister Long, and then there were screams and sounds of a fight. I peeked from the stairwell, and there was red stuff all over the floor!" [[12785 同事 sad]]
"I... I really don't know what to do. 'Orange' is really important to you, right? Should... should I call the police?" [[12786 同事 sad]]
Suddenly, Su Tao remembered the phone call she had taken with Chi Xiaocheng before. [[12787 旁白 neutral]]
Even though it was just a phone call, Long Mian had still scolded her in front of Chi Xiaocheng. [[12788 旁白 neutral]]
Is that why Xiaocheng went to my workplace to cause trouble? [[12789 苏桃 sad]]
Coming back to her senses, she quickly asked, "What's the situation now?" [[12790 苏桃 sad]]
"'Orange' already left with her people, but she left a tall, sturdy guy here. He... he warned me not to call the police... I... I don't know what to do." [[12791 同事 sad]]
"What about Sister Long? Does anyone else know what happened here?" [[12792 苏桃 sad]]
"That tall, sturdy man took a mop and went upstairs... I... ah! The... the cabinet moved, he saw me, I-I-I can't talk anymore, I'm hanging up!" [[12793 同事 sad]]
Without giving Su Tao any more information, the call ended with the dial tone. [[12794 旁白 neutral]]
The floor was covered in red paint, a man took a mop upstairs, and even... [[12795 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao stood in the living room, looking at the utility table in front of the sofa. [[12796 旁白 sad]]
Only the sheath of the fruit knife was left, waiting there all alone. [[12797 旁白 sad]]
Without a doubt, Su Tao knew what the paranoid Chi Xiaocheng had gone to do. [[12798 旁白 sad]]
She imagined the worst-case scenario, and turning around, she grabbed her clothes, ready to leave. [[12799 旁白 sad]]
But when she reached the door, she was hit by the biting cold wind that stung her face. [[12800 旁白 sad]]
She hesitated again. [[12801 旁白 sad]]
Can I really go out? [[12802 苏桃 sad]]
There are security cameras in the hallway. I wonder if Xiaocheng will check them. What if I miss her, and she comes back while I'm out? What will the consequences be? [[12803 苏桃 sad]]
She felt conflicted. [[12804 旁白 sad]]
And then she became scared. [[12805 旁白 sad]]
The foot she had stepped forward with, she pulled back. [[12806 旁白 sad]]
This house was like the circle Sun Wukong drew for Tang Monk; she was inside it, with a reason she absolutely couldn't leave. [[12807 旁白 sad]]
But if I don't go out, what will Xiaocheng do next? [[12808 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao stood at the doorway in a daze for a long time. Her already pale face looked even more haggard from the cold wind. [[12809 旁白 sad]]
She snapped back to reality when another phone call came in. [[12810 旁白 neutral]]
This time, it was Chen Qian calling. "Su Tao, where are you?! Did you not keep an eye on Chi Xiaocheng? She went to find your advisor! They said she caused a huge scene in the office, even security showed up, and a lot of administrators are there!" [[12811 陈倩 angry]]
"Boom," a clap of thunder seemed to strike Su Tao's mind, echoing again and again. [[12812 旁白 sad]]
She remembered a sentence she had read before. [[12813 旁白 neutral]]
An extreme yandere will interfere in the life of the one they love in order to possess them. [[12814 旁白 sad]]
They mess up their life, eliminate everyone else, so that the one they love only has eyes for them. [[12815 旁白 sad]]
The memory of that lucid dream flooded her mind again. [[12816 旁白 sad]]
The Xiaocheng in the dream, wasn't she eliminating the people around me one by one? [[12817 苏桃 sad]]
She was hiding things from me while isolating me, leaving only herself by my side. [[12818 苏桃 sad]]
And so, they achieved an ending where they were codependent on each other. [[12819 旁白 sad]]
Now it's Long Mian and my advisor. Will it be Chen Qian, Xiaowei, Si Chen, and Dongfang Yang next? [[12820 苏桃 sad]]
Or everyone I know? [[12821 苏桃 sad]]
No matter how much Su Tao tried not to think about it, a voice in her head kept telling her. [[12822 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng is already interfering in my life! [[12823 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao clutched her head in pain, feeling like a powder keg about to explode. [[12824 旁白 angry]]
After messing up my life, what will she do next? [[12825 苏桃 angry]]
Will she come back with a cute smile as if nothing happened? [[12826 苏桃 angry]]
Can I really do what Si Chen said, to tolerate everything about her, to love everything about her? [[12827 苏桃 sad]]
And then help her hurt the people around me? [[12828 苏桃 sad]]
One question after another appeared in her mind, but she couldn't think of a solution. [[12829 旁白 sad]]
What like, what love, what comfort. [[12830 旁白 sad]]
All sorts of negative emotions were about to consume Su Tao's sanity. [[12831 旁白 sad]]
How could she possibly calm down and think about these things? [[12832 旁白 sad]]
Her instincts were even telling her to just give in to Xiaocheng. [[12833 旁白 sad]]
Although she was acting scary, maybe if she just went along with her wishes, she could feel the care within her love. [[12834 旁白 sad]]
Chaos, struggle. [[12835 旁白 sad]]
However, just as she was trying to figure things out, Chi Xiaocheng came back. [[12836 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Su Tao had thought, she wore a cute and lovely smile as if nothing had happened. [[12837 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, you're awake? I went out and bought a fish. How about some fish soup tonight?" [[12838 池小橙 happy]]
Like a wife returning home about to cook, her cute face was full of anticipation. [[12839 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, that's if you ignore her terrifying, glowing red vertical pupils. [[12840 旁白 sad]]
The Cat's Pupils skill would make one feel fear and pressure when meeting her gaze. Even someone as close as Su Tao couldn't avoid the effect of this passive skill. [[12841 旁白 sad]]
Looking so well-behaved, who would have thought that this little loli had just been brandishing a knife outside? [[12842 旁白 sad]]
How is Long Mian? [[12843 苏桃 sad]]
Is my advisor okay? [[12844 苏桃 sad]]
How did the school administration handle this? [[12845 苏桃 sad]]
Has Xiaocheng's yandere side gotten even worse? [[12846 苏桃 sad]]
