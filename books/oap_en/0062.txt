Chapter 62 System, Why Isn't Your Blackening Skill Working? [[5456 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng unhurriedly walked over. The moment she opened the door, she saw Ye Liang standing directly in front of her, his aura like muffled thunder, extremely oppressive. [[5457 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, at 1.66 meters, was no match for Ye Liang, who was 1.86 meters. [[5458 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng truly had to crane her neck to see Ye Liang's expression. [[5459 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng?" [[5460 叶良 neutral]]
Ye Liang looked down at that cute, unadorned face. His words, which had originally been spoken in anger, now carried a hint of surprise and doubt. [[5461 旁白 neutral]]
Although Chi Xiaocheng had given him water during the last basketball game, Ye Liang had never truly looked at her. [[5462 旁白 neutral]]
In today's society, where appearance matters, this face, enhanced by the delicate soft candy, glowed with a radiance that made Ye Liang momentarily unsure if this person was the one he knew. [[5463 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng showed no intention of hiding anything. Instead, she smiled happily at Ye Liang, "I saw you from upstairs just now. Come in." [[5464 池小橙 happy]]
The intermediate acting skill quietly activated. [[5465 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang frowned and stepped in. Without even changing his shoes, he stood in the entryway, staring intently at Chi Xiaocheng, "Are you Chi Xiaocheng?" [[5466 叶良 neutral]]
"It's me." [[5467 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded with a smile. [[5468 旁白 neutral]]
If this smile were directed at Dongfang Yang, that cynical and arrogant young master would probably have already been captivated. [[5469 旁白 neutral]]
But in Ye Liang's eyes, it was like mockery. [[5470 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, his anger flared up. [[5471 旁白 neutral]]
He stepped forward, leaned down, and glared, "You, what kind of bewitching potion did you give Su Tao?!" [[5472 叶良 angry]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng's smile didn't diminish, and she didn't even flinch. "Ye Liang, what do you mean?" [[5473 池小橙 neutral]]
"Heh!" Ye Liang sneered, "You targeted Su Tao for months, and repeatedly disrupted my relationship with her. Suddenly, you claim to have repented. Only that idiot would believe you because of her nostalgic filter. Do you think you can fool me?" [[5474 叶良 angry]]
"Do you really think I won't touch you just because Su Tao speaks for you?!" [[5475 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang extended a hand, slowly clenching it into a fist starting from his pinky finger. He stared into Chi Xiaocheng's crimson eyes and said word by word, "This is my last warning to you. If you dare to appear in front of Su Tao and me again, I have ways to make you disappear!" [[5476 叶良 angry]]
As the CEO and young master of a prominent family, it was effortless for him to cause Chi Xiaocheng an accident. [[5477 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't done anything to Chi Xiaocheng because of Su Tao's protection. [[5478 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng's audacity had already touched his bottom line! [[5479 旁白 neutral]]
The authority of a superior poured out without reservation. He wanted to see the same fear and terror on Chi Xiaocheng's face as before, to break her disguise. [[5480 旁白 neutral]]
But after he finished speaking, Chi Xiaocheng didn't even blink. [[5481 旁白 neutral]]
But her eyes had gradually grown cold, and the normal person portrayed by her intermediate acting skills was slowly receding, "Don't." [[5482 池小橙 neutral]]
"What did you say?" [[5483 叶良 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng narrowed her eyes, "I said, I refuse!" [[5484 池小橙 neutral]]
With a "whoosh," Ye Liang's raised hand quickly grabbed Chi Xiaocheng. [[5485 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, he clamped her neck and effortlessly lifted her into the air. [[5486 旁白 neutral]]
Her feet couldn't touch the ground. Chi Xiaocheng's face flushed slightly as her breathing became difficult. [[5487 旁白 neutral]]
But there was still no fear or terror on her face. Instead, her smile became even more sinister, "Ye Liang, if you have the guts, strangle me to death right here!" [[5488 池小橙 angry]]
Ye Liang exerted a little more force with his hand, his expression quickly changing. Finally, he threw Chi Xiaocheng to the ground, "My matters with Su Tao are none of your business!" [[5489 叶良 angry]]
"I think you are..." [[5490 叶良 neutral]]
Before he could finish, he was interrupted by Chi Xiaocheng. [[5491 旁白 neutral]]
"Why can't I interfere?" [[5492 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng coughed twice, clutching her neck as she climbed up from the ground. Her crimson eyes stared intently at Ye Liang. [[5493 旁白 neutral]]
She was like a trapped beast in despair, constantly gasping for breath. Her grim and terrifying smile on that cute face was so incongruous. [[5494 旁白 neutral]]
She was like a yandere now. [[5495 旁白 neutral]]
It was just that her crimson eyes, which should have glowed red, didn't, making her seem to lack something. She had the aura but lacked a certain charm. [[5496 旁白 neutral]]
But Ye Liang was still stunned by Chi Xiaocheng's roaring words. His eyebrows furrowed, "I've told you many times, it's impossible for me to like someone like you. Your obstruction of me and Su Tao will only make me hate you more!" [[5497 叶良 angry]]
His tone wasn't as aggressive as before. [[5498 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's abnormal state was obvious to anyone. [[5499 旁白 neutral]]
This guy, saying this, likes me to this extent? [[5500 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng burst into laughter, her voice gradually becoming frenzied, "Yes! It doesn't matter if you like me or not. I didn't expect you to like me, but Su Tao is different!" [[5501 池小橙 angry]]
"Only her, you are not allowed!" [[5502 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng roared, as if she suddenly thought of something, and froze for a moment, "Oh, right, now's a good opportunity." [[5503 池小橙 neutral]]
Apparently, her frenzy scared Ye Liang. This young master, who had seen many things, had a bad premonition, and his scalp tingled. [[5504 旁白 neutral]]
He instinctively took a step back, "What are you talking about?" [[5505 叶良 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head and smiled. The hand that had been behind her back slowly extended. [[5506 旁白 neutral]]
In her hand was a delicate fruit knife. [[5507 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang!" Chi Xiaocheng's voice carried a forced hatred, "How about you stay here forever? That way, you'll never be able to get close to Tao Tao." [[5508 池小橙 angry]]
She stood still, slightly hunched, as if about to charge. [[5509 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang reacted quickly, immediately adopting a defensive stance. [[5510 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[5511 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't charge forward immediately. [[5512 旁白 neutral]]
She anxiously shouted to the system in her mind, "System, my performance should be very angry right now. Blackening, blackening! I should be acting very blackened now, activate the skill for me, otherwise I can't beat Ye Liang!" [[5513 池小橙 angry]]
Unexpectedly, the system did not respond to Chi Xiaocheng. [[5514 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, she was full of momentum, neither advancing nor retreating. [[5515 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, Chi Xiaocheng gritted her teeth and continued to exert the remaining heat of her acting. [[5516 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang, you stay here!" [[5517 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng exaggeratedly rushed forward. As soon as she got close to Ye Liang, before she could stab him, he easily blocked her attack. [[5518 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, he kept cursing, "Chi Xiaocheng, are you crazy?!" [[5519 叶良 angry]]
"Yes, I'm crazy! I'll cut off your hands and feet, so you can't take a single step out of this house, and then you'll never be able to get close to Su Tao!" Chi Xiaocheng trembled, trying to exert force. She wanted to feign anger and then blacken, but found that the system's skill did not successfully trigger. [[5520 池小橙 angry]]
With a gentle push, she stumbled back several steps. [[5521 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wasn't sure what was happening. She could trigger the blackening skill when facing Si Chen, but why did it fail when facing the even more unpleasant Ye Liang? [[5522 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to try again. [[5523 旁白 neutral]]
But as soon as she took a step, her left foot tripped over her right. [[5524 旁白 neutral]]
She fell to the ground in a flat fall. [[5525 旁白 neutral]]
The small knife also flew out of her hand. [[5526 旁白 neutral]]
Coincidentally, no matter how Chi Xiaocheng swung the knife, she couldn't touch Ye Liang. Now that the small knife flew out, it just happened to stab him in the thigh. [[5527 旁白 neutral]]
This gloomy young master's face immediately showed a twisted expression of pain. [[5528 旁白 neutral]]
With a deviation from the plan, Chi Xiaocheng's expression couldn't help but stiffen. [[5529 旁白 neutral]]
The system was not working, and this time she was truly powerless. [[5530 旁白 neutral]]
She originally wanted to play a yandere, then blacken. Even if she couldn't keep Ye Liang forever, she wanted to make him afraid of her. [[5531 旁白 neutral]]
But where was her acting that Si Chen couldn't see through? Where was her blackening with ten times the combat power? [[5532 旁白 neutral]]
System, come out and save me! Your skill isn't working! [[5533 池小橙 sad]]
