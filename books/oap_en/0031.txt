Chapter 31: Crisis, Under Suspicion! [[2636 旁白 neutral]]
Standing in the shade of a tree, Chi Xiaocheng rolled her eyes, wondering if she should get closer and listen to what they were talking about. [[2637 池小橙 neutral]]
Or maybe she should chime in to make her presence felt. [[2638 池小橙 neutral]]
Standing where she was, information about the original owner and Si Chen surfaced in her mind. [[2639 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen wore glasses and was tall, about 1.9 meters. [[2640 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang initially had a modest position in his family, but he used his family's resources at a young age to build his own business empire, regaining a firm footing in the family through his own influence. [[2641 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang, on the other hand, was the sole son who was showered with love. He could live as he pleased and squander the family fortune, living a very carefree life. [[2642 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen was different from Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang. [[2643 旁白 neutral]]
He was the second son of the Si family. In the plot, he was pushed out during a family struggle and ended up in Jiuzhou City from the capital. [[2644 旁白 neutral]]
By getting to know the female lead, Su Tao, he slowly gained resources and returned to his family to show them who's boss. At this stage, his relationship with Su Tao was more like a pure friendship between a man and a woman. [[2645 旁白 neutral]]
It was only later, through his interactions with Su Tao, that Si Chen gradually fell for this "white moonlight" and began to compete with the other male leads. [[2646 旁白 neutral]]
The original owner had very little interaction with him, having only confessed her feelings once. [[2647 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed that Si Chen, with his glasses and gloomy expression, was too intimidating, so the original owner never dared to bother him again after that one confession. [[2648 旁白 neutral]]
"But this bit of information isn't enough." [[2649 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes flickered. "System, spend 200 Emotion Points to buy chapters 160 to 200 of the original novel." [[2650 池小橙 neutral]]
Her memory only went up to chapter 160, where the original owner died and a new female villain, Chen Qian, appeared. [[2651 旁白 neutral]]
Now, because of her, the butterfly effect had already begun, and the subsequent plot could only be used as a reference. [[2652 旁白 neutral]]
Memories flooded into her mind, and Chi Xiaocheng frowned. [[2653 旁白 neutral]]
It was just as she had guessed. [[2654 池小橙 neutral]]
The following plot completely deviated from the current developments. [[2655 旁白 neutral]]
In the next 40 chapters, half were about Su Tao struggling with what happened with Chi Xiaocheng and getting over it with the help of the male leads. The other half was about a new, god-like doctor male lead. [[2656 旁白 neutral]]
The main storyline was about healing her injuries. [[2657 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was still around; he had the highest favorability towards Su Tao and often competed with the doctor male lead. [[2658 旁白 neutral]]
As for a small fry like Dongfang Yang, even in the original novel, he was just an errand boy during this time. [[2659 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen was still on his way. [[2660 旁白 neutral]]
"Although the follow-up plot doesn't mention him yet, his relationship with Su Tao hasn't warmed up. Maybe I can use this?" [[2661 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng squinted at the two people chatting, hesitating whether to go forward and make her presence known. [[2662 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, Si Chen, who had been chatting with Su Tao, turned his head. His deep eyes were as aggressive as a cobra's, and his stare made Chi Xiaocheng tremble. [[2663 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly lowered her head and slipped into the crowd. [[2664 旁白 neutral]]
The idea she just had was completely extinguished. [[2665 旁白 neutral]]
Her sixth sense told her that this person was very dangerous! [[2666 池小橙 neutral]]
After she hurried away, Su Tao noticed something was off with Si Chen and turned to ask, "What's wrong?" [[2667 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen pushed up his glasses with his long middle finger, a sharp glint in his deep eyes. He smiled faintly, "It's nothing. Where were we?" [[2668 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao: "I was just asking, if a yandere existed in real life, how do you think they should be treated?" [[2669 苏桃 neutral]]
Fleeing from the school gate, Chi Xiaocheng kept muttering to herself, recalling the look he gave her. "What's with that guy? It's the first time I've ever felt such an intense aura, like he wanted to tear me to pieces." [[2670 池小橙 sad]]
She silently warned herself not to provoke Si Chen until she could protect herself. [[2671 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, she arrived outside the Moonlight Cafe. [[2672 旁白 neutral]]
Because she had told Dongfang Yang before leaving, the young master was now standing at the entrance, bored and playing with his phone. [[2673 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone and checked her outfit: a cute bear hoodie hiding her small frame, her brown hair down, with two small white lotus hairpins holding back a bit of hair on each side. [[2674 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike traditional twin tails, these two strands swayed with her movements, giving off the pure charm of a girl next door. [[2675 旁白 neutral]]
She walked over, deliberately staying out of Dongfang Yang's line of sight. [[2676 旁白 neutral]]
Then she jumped out, "Boss, are you waiting for me?" [[2677 池小橙 happy]]
Your little cutie has suddenly appeared! [[2678 旁白 happy]]
Dongfang Yang was startled, and those words immediately popped into his head. [[2679 旁白 neutral]]
He cleared his throat, fist to his lips. "The AC just turned on in the cafe and it's a bit hot. I was just getting some fresh air while they adjust the temperature." [[2680 东方阳 neutral]]
"I see..." Chi Xiaocheng said, staring straight at him. "I would have been very happy if you said you were waiting for me!" [[2681 池小橙 happy]]
Meeting her expectant gaze, Dongfang Yang's heart skipped a beat for no reason. [[2682 旁白 neutral]]
He quickly scoffed, "Don't be so full of yourself, you idiot. It's just a coincidence." [[2683 东方阳 angry]]
With that, he walked into the cafe first. [[2684 旁白 neutral]]
Following behind him, Chi Xiaocheng had a playful smile on her face. [[2685 旁白 happy]]
A little tsundere. You think I can't handle you with a direct approach like that? [[2686 池小橙 happy]]
When they got to the cafe, Dongfang Yang started explaining the job to Chi Xiaocheng. "Your job is to just sit here. You can take money, chat with customers, and if you don't know how to make coffee, just have Chu San help you." [[2687 东方阳 neutral]]
The honest-looking man waiting at the counter smiled at Chi Xiaocheng. "Hello, Miss. My name is Chu San." [[2688 褚三 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang waved his hand. "No need to be so formal. She's just another worker." [[2689 东方阳 neutral]]
Then he looked at Chi Xiaocheng again. "For now, it's just the two of you in the cafe. If you don't understand something, ask Chu San. I don't care what you do, but don't run my cafe into the ground, got it?" [[2690 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded meekly. "Boss, can I use my phone at work?" [[2691 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's mouth twitched. "As long as it doesn't interfere with your work." [[2692 东方阳 neutral]]
"Okay." [[2693 池小橙 happy]]
So that means I can use it. [[2694 池小橙 happy]]
It seemed like he was just looking for an excuse to let her pay off her debt; he probably never expected her to actually run this cafe. [[2695 旁白 neutral]]
His main goal was to give himself a reason to help her pay her debt and to protect her. [[2696 旁白 neutral]]
Even if his starting point was the female lead, Su Tao. [[2697 旁白 neutral]]
But Dongfang Yang's opinion of her had clearly changed. [[2698 旁白 neutral]]
Sighing internally, Chi Xiaocheng bowed again and said seriously, "Thank you, Young Master Dongfang. I'll do my best!" [[2699 池小橙 happy]]
This 'thank you' was from the heart. [[2700 旁白 neutral]]
He wasn't a bad person, he just had a different position than her. [[2701 旁白 neutral]]
Don't worry, Dongfang Yang, I'll take good care of Taotao for you! [[2702 池小橙 happy]]
In the future, whether we're kissing or in bed, I'll silently say your name in my heart and thank you for your contribution, just to make you feel included. [[2703 池小橙 happy]]
Dongfang Yang had come to the cafe mainly to show Chi Xiaocheng around. Now that the introductions were done, he was planning to leave. [[2704 旁白 neutral]]
But before he left, he mentioned the hospitalization. "Although I don't know what you and Su Tao are hiding from me, I hope you'll be more rational, and don't break Su Tao's heart. Especially what happened last time, don't be so willful again." [[2705 东方阳 neutral]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng's heart skipped a beat. [[2706 旁白 sad]]
She quickly nodded like a chicken pecking at rice. [[2707 旁白 neutral]]
'Last time' referred to the basement incident. [[2708 旁白 neutral]]
He still suspects me! [[2709 池小橙 sad]]
Although his impression of her had improved, his doubts had clearly not disappeared. [[2710 旁白 neutral]]
"I need to prove that my emotional breakdown and psychological problems were because I was bullied. I need a source of despair to be the root of my yandere personality." [[2711 池小橙 neutral]]
For a moment, Dongfang Yang's suspicious glance and Si Chen's snake-like eyes flashed through her mind. [[2712 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng began to plot, recalling the people who used to bully the original owner. [[2713 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone and sent a WeChat message to someone named "Liu Guijia." [[2714 旁白 neutral]]
"Liu Guijia, when are you going to pay me back?" [[2715 池小橙 neutral]]
Right now, I'm just a weak and helpless little lolita! [[2716 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly looked up, a fierce glint in her rational eyes. [[2717 旁白 neutral]]
