第31章 危机，被怀疑了！
Chapter 31: Crisis, I'm Being Suspected!
站在树荫下，池小橙转动着眼珠子，思考要不要凑上去听听看二人聊些什么。
Standing in the shade of a tree, 池小橙's eyes darted around as she wondered if she should sneak closer to eavesdrop on their conversation.
或者插上一嘴，增加一下自己的存在感。
Or maybe she should interrupt and make her presence known.
站在原地，脑海中过着原主和司辰相关的信息。
Standing where she was, information about the original owner of her body and 司辰 flashed through her mind.
司辰戴眼镜，是高个，有1米9。
司辰 wore glasses, was tall, about 1.9 meters.
叶良起先在家族中地位一般，但年纪轻轻就利用家族资源建立起属于自己的商业帝国，以自己的影响力重新在家族中站稳脚跟。
At first, 叶良's position in his family was average, but at a young age, he used the family's resources to build his own business empire, using his influence to secure his standing within the family.
东方阳则是集万千宠爱于一身的独子，生活任你作，产业随你烧，活得很是潇洒。
东方阳, on the other hand, was the sole son, showered with love and affection. He could live as wildly as he wanted, burn through the family fortune as he pleased, and lived a very carefree life.
司辰和叶良东方阳二人不一样。
司辰 was different from both 叶良 and 东方阳.
他是司家次子，剧情设定中他在家族之争中被排挤在外，从京城流落到了九州市。
He was the second son of the 司 family. According to the plot, he was pushed out during a family power struggle and ended up wandering from the capital to 九州市.
通过和女主苏桃相识，慢慢地掌握资源，重回家族装逼打脸，现阶段他和苏桃，其实更像是异性朋友间的纯正友谊。
By getting to know the female lead, 苏桃, he slowly gained resources and returned to his family to show off and put his rivals in their place. At this stage, his relationship with 苏桃 was actually more like a pure friendship between a guy and a girl.
只是后来司辰在和苏桃的交互中，慢慢喜欢上了这位白月光，与诸多男主开始竞争。
It was only later, through his interactions with 苏桃, that 司辰 gradually fell for his "white moonlight" and began to compete with the other male leads for her affection.
原主和他的交集很少，只表白过一次。
The original owner of her body had very little interaction with him, having only confessed her feelings once.
那次似乎是觉得戴着眼镜一脸阴沉的司辰太吓人，原主表白过一次后就不敢再去惹这个人了。
It seemed that after that one time, the original owner was too scared by 司辰's gloomy expression and glasses, so she never dared to bother him again.
"But this information isn't enough for now."
池小橙眸子闪烁了一下，"System, spend 200 emotion points to buy chapters 160 to 200 of the original novel."
她印象只到160章内容中原主死亡下线，新的女反派陈倩上线。
Her memory only went up to chapter 160, where the original owner died and was written out of the story, and the new female villain, 陈倩, was introduced.
Now, because of her, the butterfly effect had already begun. The future plot could only be used as a reference.
Memories flooded into her mind like the wind, and 池小橙 frowned.
Just as she had guessed.
The subsequent plot completely deviated from how things were developing now.
In the next 40 chapters, half of them were about 苏桃 struggling with what happened to 池小橙 and overcoming her grief with the help of the male leads. The other half was about a new male lead, a genius doctor.
The main storyline revolved around healing her injuries.
叶良 was still around; he had the highest affection level for 苏桃 and often competed with this genius doctor male lead.
As for a small fry like 东方阳, even in the original novel, he was just running errands during this period.
司辰 was still on his way.
"Although he hasn't been mentioned in the plot for a while, his relationship with 苏桃 hasn't heated up yet. Maybe I can use this to my advantage?"
池小橙 squinted at the two of them chatting, hesitating about whether to go forward and make her presence known.
Suddenly, 司辰, who had been talking with 苏桃, sharply turned his head. His deep, aggressive eyes, like those of a cobra, locked onto her, making 池小橙 tremble.
She quickly lowered her head and disappeared into the crowd.
Completely extinguishing the idea she just had.
Her sixth sense was screaming at her: this person is dangerous!
After she had hurried away, 苏桃 finally noticed something was off with 司辰 and turned to ask, "What's wrong?"
司辰 pushed his glasses up with his long middle finger, a sharp glint flashing in his deep eyes. He smiled faintly, "It's nothing. Where were we?"
苏桃: "We were talking about yanderes. If they existed in real life, how do you think they could be treated?"
Having escaped the school gate, 池小橙 kept muttering to herself, replaying that stare in her mind. "What's with that guy? It's the first time I've ever felt an aura so intense. It felt like he wanted to tear me to pieces."
She made a secret promise to herself not to provoke 司辰 until she could protect herself.
Soon, she arrived outside the Moonlight Cafe.
Because she had told 东方阳 before leaving, the young master was now standing bored at the entrance, playing with his phone.
She took out her phone to check her outfit: a cute bear hoodie hiding her small frame, her brown hair flowing down, with small sections on each side held back by delicate white lotus hairpins.
It wasn't a traditional twin-tail look; these two strands swayed with her movements, giving her the pure and innocent charm of the girl next door.
She walked over, intentionally staying out of 东方阳's line of sight.
Then, she jumped out. "Boss, were you waiting for me?"
Your little cutie has suddenly appeared!
He coughed lightly into his fist. "They just turned on the AC in the cafe and it's a bit warm while the temperature adjusts. I was just out here getting some cool air."
"Oh, is that so..." 池小橙 sighed, staring straight at him. "I would be really happy if you said you were waiting for me, though!"
Meeting her expectant gaze, 东方阳 felt a strange panic in his heart.
Then he scoffed, "Don't flatter yourself, you idiot. It was just a coincidence that I ran into you."
With that, he walked into the cafe first.
Following behind him, 池小橙 wore a playful smile.
Such a tsundere. You think I can't handle you with a direct approach like this?
Once inside, 东方阳 began to explain the job to 池小橙. "Your task is to just hang around here. You can take money, chat with customers, whatever. If you don't know how to make coffee, just have 褚三 help you."
The simple-looking man waiting at the counter smiled at 池小橙. "Hello, miss. My name is 褚三."
东方阳 waved his hand. "No need to be so polite. She's just another worker here."
Then he looked at 池小橙 again. "For now, it's just the two of you in the cafe. If there's anything you don't understand, ask 褚三. I don't care what you do, but don't run my cafe into the ground, got it?"
池小橙 nodded meekly. "Boss, can I play on my phone during work?"
东方阳's mouth twitched. "As long as it doesn't interfere with your work."
"Okay."
So that means I can.
No matter how you look at it, this was just an excuse for me to pay off my debt. He probably never expected me to actually run this cafe.
The main goal was to give me a way to pay him back and to protect me.
Even if his motive was originally for the female lead, 苏桃.
But 东方阳's opinion of me had clearly changed.
Sighing inwardly, 池小橙 bowed again, very seriously. "Thank you, Young Master 东方. I'll do my best!"
This "thank you" came from the heart.
This person isn't a bad person, our positions were just different.
Don't worry, 东方阳, I'll take good care of 桃桃 for you!
Whether we're kissing or in bed, I'll silently say your name in my heart and thank you for your contribution, just to make you feel a little included.
Before he left, he mentioned the hospitalization. "Although I don't know what you and 苏桃 are hiding from me, I hope you'll be more rational in whatever you do. Don't hurt 苏桃's feelings, especially about what happened last time. Don't be so willful again."
Hearing this, 池小橙's heart skipped a beat.
"Last time" referred to the basement.
I'm still a suspect!
Even though his impression of me has improved, his doubts clearly haven't disappeared.
"I need to prove my excuse—that I had an emotional breakdown and developed psychological issues because I was bullied. I need to create a source for my 'yandere' persona, something born from despair-like pressure."
In an instant, 东方阳's recent suspicion and 司辰's cobra-like stare flashed through her mind.
池小橙 began to plot, her mind gradually recalling the people who used to bully the original owner.
She took out her phone and sent a WeChat message to a person with the contact name "刘桂嘉".
"刘桂嘉, when are you going to pay me back?"
Right now, I'm just a weak and helpless little loli, easy to bully!
池小橙 slowly lifted her head, a ruthless glint shining in her otherwise rational eyes.
