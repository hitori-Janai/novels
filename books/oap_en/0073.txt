Chapter 73 Setting the Trap (Bonus for Luye Lin) [[6372 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng always overthinks things like this. [[6373 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, who had been asked this question many times, gradually developed resistance to such words. [[6374 旁白 neutral]]
Anyway, she was just humoring her, appeasing her, pretending to like her. [[6375 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao naturally smiled, "Xiaocheng, don't worry, you're the one I care about." [[6376 苏桃 neutral]]
She didn't directly say she liked her. [[6377 旁白 neutral]]
Using rhetoric to avoid responding. [[6378 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng understood Su Tao's thoughts and didn't expose them. Instead, she continued to cling to her, her warm breath fanning Su Tao's earlobe, "Tao Tao can only like me. Whether it's Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, or Ye Liang, Tao Tao absolutely cannot like them~" [[6379 池小橙 neutral]]
"Otherwise..." [[6380 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled sweetly, not continuing. Instead, she sat on the sofa stool, swinging her two small legs, waiting for her coffee. [[6381 旁白 neutral]]
The ambiguous and harmonious relationship between the two had cooled considerably due to Dongfang Yang's arrival and Chi Xiaocheng's change of expression. [[6382 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't help but wonder, if Chi Xiaocheng was always like this, would her interpersonal relationships become a mess? [[6383 旁白 neutral]]
Just a few words, and she developed hostility towards Dongfang Yang. [[6384 旁白 neutral]]
The relaxation she felt from recalling her childhood because of the steamed buns quietly turned into pressure. [[6385 旁白 neutral]]
The coffee was served. [[6386 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng added a spoonful of sugar, then watched Su Tao add two and a half spoonfuls. [[6387 旁白 neutral]]
Sure enough, Tao Tao's favorite was sweets. [[6388 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng noted this detail and watched Su Tao with her hands cupped under her chin. [[6389 旁白 neutral]]
Smiling silently. [[6390 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps it was the pressure from Chi Xiaocheng's gaze, but Su Tao drank cup after cup of coffee, appearing somewhat impatient. [[6391 旁白 neutral]]
They spent the entire morning in the warm cafe, enjoying a wonderful and cozy time. [[6392 旁白 neutral]]
At noon, after the two had lunch. [[6393 旁白 neutral]]
Tiny snowflakes began to fall from the sky. [[6394 旁白 neutral]]
The temperature seemed to drop a few degrees at this moment. [[6395 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao clasped her hands together and exhaled a warm breath, "This weather is really uncomfortable." [[6396 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng, with her hands in her pockets, responded, "Yes, I heard it's going to be especially cold this year. You usually don't turn on the air conditioning in the dorm at night, do you?" [[6397 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded, "It's fine to use the air conditioning in summer, but the heating in winter can be very stuffy, I can't stand it." [[6398 苏桃 neutral]]
"Then..." Chi Xiaocheng jumped in front of her, her eyes sparkling with anticipation, "How about coming to my place? It's not far anyway, and we can sleep together!" [[6399 池小橙 neutral]]
"S-sleep together?" [[6400 苏桃 surprised]]
"Yes!" Chi Xiaocheng shook her head, "I want to sleep holding Tao Tao. Tao Tao is soft and fragrant, I like it~" [[6401 池小橙 happy]]
But the one who is truly soft, fragrant, and small enough to be easily embraced, is you, Xiaocheng! [[6402 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's heart fluttered a little at Chi Xiaocheng's suggestion. [[6403 旁白 neutral]]
She and Chen Qian were used to waking up early. The other two roommates in the dorm were the type who slept until 11 AM and ate breakfast and lunch together, so she always tiptoed when she got up and left. [[6404 旁白 neutral]]
But then she thought of Chi Xiaocheng's yandere state. [[6405 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao still avoided it, making an excuse, "Applying for an overnight stay is quite troublesome, and I have many early morning classes. It's not good to run back and forth from the classroom." [[6406 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay..." [[6407 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng was a little disappointed, but she didn't have an episode, which made Su Tao secretly relieved. [[6408 旁白 neutral]]
So she quickly changed the subject, "Let's go to the cat cafe first. It's a bit remote, so we'll have to walk a bit." [[6409 苏桃 neutral]]
"Can a remote cat cafe make money?" [[6410 池小橙 neutral]]
"It's Dongfang Yang's business. I heard he settled a few high school students who couldn't afford to study due to family reasons. He picked up a lot of stray cats from his other businesses, tamed them, and then sent them to the cat cafe to be raised." [[6411 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao had a small expectation, "He told me about it last time, but I haven't been there yet." [[6412 苏桃 neutral]]
Sure enough, Tao Tao is a cat lover. [[6413 旁白 neutral]]
She had to remember this too. [[6414 旁白 neutral]]
They walked together towards the cat cafe, but halfway there, Su Tao blushed and said to Chi Xiaocheng, "Xiaocheng, wait for me here for a moment. I'm going to the nearby public restroom. I drank too much coffee." [[6415 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay~" [[6416 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng responded with a nod, extremely obedient. [[6417 旁白 neutral]]
She had already made up her mind to ask a few times whether she liked cats or her when she got there. [[6418 旁白 neutral]]
Then she would pretend to be a cat to win Su Tao's affection. [[6419 旁白 neutral]]
If she got close to those high school girls, she would act pathological again. [[6420 旁白 neutral]]
Still the same goal, continue to put pressure on Su Tao. [[6421 旁白 neutral]]
She had to make her realize. [[6422 旁白 neutral]]
She must be completely devoted to me, Xiaocheng. [[6423 旁白 neutral]]
However, fate had other plans. [[6424 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had already planned everything, but an accident happened. [[6425 旁白 neutral]]
A sports car roared past on the road beside them. [[6426 旁白 neutral]]
Nothing happened at first, but after a while, the sports car reversed. [[6427 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow, put away her phone, and watched the sports car warily. [[6428 旁白 neutral]]
A tall figure stepped out of the sports car. [[6429 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng, what a small world!" [[6430 叶良 angry]]
It was Ye Liang! [[6431 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, Chi Xiaocheng pulled her hand out of her pocket and took out a fruit knife from the system space. [[6432 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes were vigilant and cold. [[6433 旁白 neutral]]
The driver was his bodyguard. As soon as he got out of the car, he stood tall beside Ye Liang, flexing his arm muscles, "Young Master, is that her? There are no cameras here. Should I kill him?" [[6434 保镖 neutral]]
"Don't!" Ye Liang looked at the fruit knife with lingering fear, "Don't be impulsive, you might not be able to beat her." [[6435 叶良 neutral]]
"Huh?" The bodyguard looked at Ye Liang in surprise, "Me, with 20 years of experience, once killed a tiger with a single slide tackle. Young Master, you're saying I can't beat this 1.5-meter tall girl? Seriously?" [[6436 保镖 neutral]]
Ye Liang glanced at the bodyguard, "I don't care if you want to risk your life for a few thousand yuan salary. Now call for backup, just in case!" [[6437 叶良 neutral]]
Ye Liang cautiously observed Chi Xiaocheng, and soon noticed that she was not acting as she usually did. [[6438 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed... she was quite rational? [[6439 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, this guy is a yandere. If you don't deliberately provoke her, she won't go crazy! [[6440 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Ye Liang was no longer in a hurry. He just watched Chi Xiaocheng, "What a coincidence, you're alone. You can't escape this time." [[6441 叶良 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng narrowed her eyes, "Ye Liang, you're not trying to trap me here and wait for someone, are you?" [[6442 池小橙 neutral]]
"So what?" [[6443 叶良 neutral]]
His thoughts exposed, Ye Liang was not anxious. No matter how powerful she was, could she beat his group of professionally trained bodyguards? [[6444 旁白 neutral]]
However, what he didn't expect was that Chi Xiaocheng actually walked towards him step by step, "Ye Liang, you've already targeted me. Why would you still think I'm just wandering around alone?" [[6445 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled faintly, "I'm on a date with Tao Tao~" [[6446 池小橙 neutral]]
Date! [[6447 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's anger flared up instantly. [[6448 旁白 neutral]]
His face grew even darker, "Where's Su Tao?!" [[6449 叶良 angry]]
Could it be that she was locked up by her again?! [[6450 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Chi Xiaocheng had already arrived in front of Ye Liang, not at all afraid of him trying to capture her. [[6451 旁白 neutral]]
A faint smile played on her lips, "Tao Tao went to the restroom." [[6452 池小橙 neutral]]
"Then what do you mean?!" [[6453 叶良 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng extended her small knife, making Ye Liang quickly take a step back. [[6454 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng didn't stab him. Instead, she gently held it in her backhand. [[6455 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed to be about to stab herself! [[6456 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice was deep, unnaturally tinged with pathology, "Tao Tao will be back soon. And at this moment, there's an easily enraged adult man, and a delicate, harmless little loli." [[6457 池小橙 neutral]]
"Tell me~ if I get hurt, or stabbed, who did it?" [[6458 池小橙 neutral]]
"Ye Liang, it just so happens that I can't make Tao Tao stay away from you and hate you. You came... just in time~" [[6459 池小橙 neutral]]
The tip of the knife, avoiding vital points, rested on Chi Xiaocheng's own abdomen. [[6460 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's scalp tingled, and he was drenched in cold sweat. [[6461 旁白 neutral]]
This guy, she's even so ruthless to herself! [[6462 旁白 neutral]]
If he were to act now, wouldn't it be exactly what Chi Xiaocheng wanted? [[6463 旁白 neutral]]
When he explained later, would Su Tao really side with him? [[6464 旁白 neutral]]
The two remained in a stalemate, but they didn't notice that behind a tree not far away, a figure heard every word clearly. [[6465 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stood there dumbfounded, her eyes filled with disbelief. [[6466 旁白 neutral]]
