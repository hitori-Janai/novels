Chapter 58 The Beginning of Su Tao's Fall (Bonus for Deoxys) [[5096 旁白 neutral]]
Wait, a chance to get out? [[5097 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly realized that she wasn't completely without a chance to leave. [[5098 旁白 neutral]]
The continuous high pressure and her constantly unrecovered strength had almost made Su Tao forget something Chi Xiaocheng had said before. [[5099 旁白 neutral]]
Fall in love with her. [[5100 旁白 neutral]]
Then she could leave! [[5101 旁白 neutral]]
Although the yandere Chi Xiaocheng was a bit terrifying, that was only at the beginning. In the following days, when Su Tao had to accept the situation and start obeying Chi Xiaocheng. [[5102 旁白 neutral]]
She found that she occasionally had normal moments. [[5103 旁白 neutral]]
So, could she pretend to like her according to her previous line of thought? [[5104 旁白 neutral]]
As for what would happen after she got out, she would think about that later. [[5105 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Su Tao suddenly saw the light. [[5106 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng looking completely normal at the moment, her heart settled. [[5107 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, as long as she didn't provoke her. [[5108 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao reached out a hand and cautiously asked, "Xiaocheng, can I touch your head?" [[5109 苏桃 neutral]]
"You want to touch my head?!" Chi Xiaocheng's voice was filled with surprise. She pulled Su Tao's hand and walked towards the bed, "Tao Tao, come here." [[5110 池小橙 happy]]
"Yes, you sit on the edge of the bed." [[5111 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng directed Su Tao, "Then Tao Tao, open your arms." [[5112 池小橙 neutral]]
"Like this?" [[5113 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao somewhat frantically opened her arms towards Chi Xiaocheng. [[5114 旁白 neutral]]
"Then... here I come!" [[5115 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a step back, then launched herself into her open arms. [[5116 旁白 neutral]]
The softness in her embrace, far from hurting her, made Su Tao feel very comfortable. [[5117 旁白 neutral]]
However, thinking of Chi Xiaocheng's yandere state, a hint of fear still surfaced in her heart. [[5118 旁白 neutral]]
But soon, it was dispelled by Chi Xiaocheng. [[5119 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, Tao Tao, you can pat my head for as long as you want." [[5120 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao also reacted, reaching out to stroke her hair. [[5121 旁白 neutral]]
Her tea-colored hair cascaded down to her waist, spreading out. It was thick and incredibly soft, feeling like silk, making Su Tao unable to let go. [[5122 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling the warmth and softness in her embrace, Su Tao couldn't help but sigh. [[5123 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed that since their quarrel during the summer vacation after high school graduation, it had been four months, and she hadn't properly hugged her. [[5124 旁白 neutral]]
This feeling was as comfortable and reassuring as ever. [[5125 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng buried herself in her embrace, her voice full of longing, "Tao Tao's embrace is so comfortable, so warm, I love it~" [[5126 池小橙 happy]]
Being confined in the room for so many days, Su Tao smiled naturally for the first time, "You always used to say that too." [[5127 苏桃 neutral]]
"But there are differences from before, aren't there?" [[5128 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng chuckled, "It's become softer and more comfortable~" [[5129 池小橙 happy]]
The small action made Su Tao's face flush, "Alright, that's an illusion, Xiaocheng, stop messing around." [[5130 苏桃 neutral]]
"Shy?" [[5131 池小橙 neutral]]
"We're both girls, what's there to be shy about!" [[5132 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao rubbed the small head in her palm vigorously, but soon stopped. [[5133 旁白 neutral]]
Her body remained still. [[5134 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, they were both girls, why should she be shy? [[5135 旁白 neutral]]
It used to be like this too. [[5136 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's constant "love" confessions ultimately made her feel something different from ordinary friends. [[5137 旁白 neutral]]
And once such emotions erupted, they would be unstoppable. [[5138 旁白 neutral]]
Speaking of which, Xiaocheng's hair is even better than before. [[5139 旁白 neutral]]
It smells so good too. [[5140 旁白 neutral]]
Her whole body was soft. [[5141 旁白 neutral]]
This touch was like a child who had never been exposed to wind and rain. [[5142 旁白 neutral]]
Her embrace, her smile, could heal hearts. [[5143 旁白 neutral]]
While enjoying the moment, Chi Xiaocheng moved her head and emerged from her embrace. [[5144 旁白 neutral]]
She gently closed her eyes and slightly raised her head, "Tao Tao, give me a kiss~" [[5145 池小橙 neutral]]
Although she had tried many things these past few days, this was the first time she had experienced such close proximity and direct sensation. [[5146 旁白 neutral]]
This is actually... not right, is it? [[5147 旁白 neutral]]
A voice in Su Tao's heart told her that Chi Xiaocheng was someone she had grown up with and relied on, and that her feelings were twisted and pathological. [[5148 旁白 neutral]]
Don't do this! [[5149 旁白 neutral]]
Don't do this! [[5150 旁白 neutral]]
But... if she didn't do this, if she didn't obey her, she wouldn't be able to get out, would she? [[5151 旁白 neutral]]
If she didn't even dare to do this, how could she pretend to like her? [[5152 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, I'm just pretending to like her. [[5153 旁白 neutral]]
Anyway... I've gradually gotten used to it. [[5154 旁白 neutral]]
Whether it was active or evasive, this time, without the pressure of Chi Xiaocheng's yandere transformation, Su Tao still chose to comply. [[5155 旁白 neutral]]
The struggle in her heart gradually increased. [[5156 旁白 neutral]]
And soon turned into enjoyment. [[5157 旁白 neutral]]
This was the only... love she had experienced these past few days. [[5158 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, can I touch your head?" [[5159 池小橙 neutral]]
After both had finished enjoying, Chi Xiaocheng stood on the bed again, looking at Su Tao eagerly. [[5160 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was now certain that the current Chi Xiaocheng was the normal and cute Xiaocheng. [[5161 旁白 neutral]]
So she was also very relaxed, smiling and nodding, "My hair might not be as great as yours." [[5162 苏桃 neutral]]
"Who said that? I like everything about Tao Tao." [[5163 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng reached out her small hand and placed it on Su Tao's head, her face filled with satisfaction, "Speaking of which, I've never touched Tao Tao like this before. It's like treating a small pet, it makes me feel at ease." [[5164 池小橙 neutral]]
As she spoke, Chi Xiaocheng seemed to realize she had said something wrong and immediately blushed, explaining, "Ah, I didn't mean to treat Tao Tao as a pet. It's just... how should I put it, because I like you, so..." [[5165 池小橙 neutral]]
"In this limited life, I want to try all positions, all identities with you." [[5166 池小橙 neutral]]
"Of course, that also includes the roles of master and pet." [[5167 池小橙 neutral]]
"Hehehe~~" [[5168 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng brought her small face close to Su Tao's and asked curiously, "What kind of pet does Tao Tao like?" [[5169 池小橙 neutral]]
"Cats?" [[5170 池小橙 neutral]]
"Dogs?" [[5171 池小橙 neutral]]
"Or..." A small hand, with its index finger pointing at her own cheek, her face expectant, "Do you~ like~ me~?" [[5172 池小橙 neutral]]
Her cuteness was within reach. [[5173 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, these words came from her heart. [[5174 旁白 neutral]]
The current Xiaocheng was undoubtedly in a normal state, but her yandere tendencies seemed to have merged into her normalcy. [[5175 旁白 neutral]]
Her alluring voice was like a little succubus. As long as she nodded in agreement, she could have a cute little pet. [[5176 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and slowly asked, "If I say I like Xiaocheng, will Xiaocheng really listen to me?" [[5177 苏桃 neutral]]
"Of course!" Chi Xiaocheng nodded foolishly, "As a pet, I definitely have to listen to Tao Tao, Master~~~" [[5178 池小橙 happy]]
The alluring loli voice was sweet and sticky, with a long trailing sound. [[5179 旁白 neutral]]
Anyone else would probably have fallen at this moment. [[5180 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao swallowed, her gaze shifting, "I... I still prefer cats." [[5181 苏桃 neutral]]
"Is that so?" Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head, then leaned closer to her, making cat paw gestures with both hands, "Meow~ Meow~~" [[5182 池小橙 neutral]]
So... so cute. [[5183 旁白 neutral]]
