Chapter 65 Find a Psychologist for Xiaocheng [[5714 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like a telepathic connection. Chi Xiaocheng had just sent a message of concern to Su Tao using her Doctor Cheng account. [[5715 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao also sent a worried message at the same time, "Doctor Cheng, I've confirmed that Xiaocheng is really a yandere. She even locked me in the house these past few days. What should I do?" [[5716 苏桃 sad]]
"She's probably still in a daze." [[5717 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng put Ye Liang's matter aside. Her mind recalled Su Tao's sweet, thin lips, and she couldn't help but smile. [[5718 旁白 neutral]]
"If something like this happened, even the closest person, Tao Tao, probably wouldn't dare to speak of it. Chen Qian, who used to have a good relationship with her, Si Chen, who claimed to be a friend, or anyone else she didn't know." [[5719 旁白 neutral]]
"Anyone in reality, she probably wouldn't tell them about this, because if she did, I would be subjected to strange looks, and in severe cases, even be taken away." [[5720 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah~ even after experiencing such a thing, she's willing to keep the secret for me~" [[5721 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng felt her heart pound. She gazed greedily at the WeChat ID named "Peach," as if seeing Su Tao, conflicted and confused, on the other side of the phone. [[5722 旁白 neutral]]
"She doesn't dare to confide in the people around her, so she can only keep it to herself. There aren't many netizens, and the only Doctor Cheng she can rely on, who is also a stranger, is me." [[5723 旁白 neutral]]
"This is simply wonderful!" [[5724 池小橙 happy]]
Doctor Orange, I, of course, must treat my sick Tao Tao well. [[5725 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng naturally wouldn't talk about the flaws. She pretended to be ignorant, "Miss Peach, how did she lock you up? Haven't you been chatting with me these past few days? Did she take your phone?" [[5726 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yes, yes, yes, that's right!" [[5727 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao was in the dormitory, her face filled with relief and excitement. [[5728 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng was indeed a psychological expert who understood yanderes. He easily deduced her situation. [[5729 旁白 neutral]]
She continued typing: "Three days ago, I went to test if she was really a yandere, and then she knocked me out. I couldn't access any outside information, and I was only released just now." [[5730 苏桃 sad]]
Peach: "Doctor, what should I do? Is Xiaocheng still curable?" [[5731 苏桃 sad]]
Even now, she still hadn't given up on the possibility of treatment. [[5732 旁白 neutral]]
What if? [[5733 旁白 neutral]]
Right. [[5734 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "I'm not sure about that either. Theoretically, there's still a chance for treatment, but I don't know the specific situation of your friend Orange, so I can't make a conclusion." [[5735 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "She can still release you from the dark room. From your description, it doesn't seem that serious." [[5736 成医生 neutral]]
Peach: "Doctor Cheng, I'm in Jiuzhou City. How about you take some time to observe Xiaocheng? I'll reimburse you for any expenses incurred." [[5737 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Uh..." [[5738 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Sorry, I have a very serious patient on hand right now, so I can't spare any time." [[5739 成医生 neutral]]
Peach: "Is it also a yandere?" [[5740 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Yes, the person she liked couldn't stand her yandere tendencies and abandoned her. Yesterday, she threatened to jump off a building, and I just rescued her." [[5741 成医生 neutral]]
Peach: "That serious? Did she really jump?" [[5742 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng: "Yes, 12 floors high. Although I caught her, she still broke a leg. I'm getting a headache taking on this patient." [[5743 成医生 neutral]]
Peach: "This..." [[5744 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng's words reminded Su Tao of the rooftop at that time. [[5745 旁白 neutral]]
If there had been a slight accident then, and she hadn't taken it seriously, the person who would have been in trouble would have been Xiaocheng. [[5746 旁白 neutral]]
Peach: "What should I do now?" [[5747 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "I suggest you don't let her suffer any stimulation. Yanderes usually don't know they are yanderes. The blackening of such people is incremental. It starts mildly, and then gets heavier and heavier as they fall deeper." [[5748 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Similarly, the general treatment method is to watch over her, pay attention to your own behavior, and stand by her no matter what happens, without stimulating her." [[5749 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "After her emotions stabilize for a long time, she will treat it as normal. At that time, you can try to gradually contact people other than her, starting from the lightest and gradually deepening her bottom line, supplemented by medication, until she returns to normal." [[5750 成医生 neutral]]
Peach: "Is that the only way?" [[5751 苏桃 sad]]
Peach: "Doctor Cheng, when will you be free?" [[5752 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "I might have some time in about three months." [[5753 成医生 neutral]]
Three months, that's too long. [[5754 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed. Given Chi Xiaocheng's current state, she might have another conflict with Ye Liang later. [[5755 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of Ye Liang, Su Tao's eyebrows subtly furrowed. [[5756 旁白 neutral]]
If the two of them met, Xiaocheng would definitely enter a yandere state. [[5757 旁白 neutral]]
This must not happen! [[5758 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Doctor Cheng, do you know any other doctors in this field? I'd like to ask one to examine Xiaocheng." [[5759 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "I don't recommend it unless it's a psychologist who specializes in the niche field of yanderes. If you categorize your friend as having a normal psychological illness and treat her, then she's truly beyond saving." [[5760 成医生 neutral]]
Sitting at home, Chi Xiaocheng had a bit of a headache. [[5761 旁白 neutral]]
As Doctor Cheng, she could only exist online. [[5762 旁白 neutral]]
It was reasonable for Su Tao to think of finding a doctor to help. [[5763 旁白 neutral]]
But she wasn't a yandere, so she couldn't really let a doctor examine her. [[5764 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen, with his half-baked psychology knowledge, saw through her acting. If a legitimate, licensed psychologist came, wouldn't her intermediate and unstable acting skills be completely exposed? [[5765 旁白 neutral]]
Peach: "Thank you, Doctor. I think I understand now. I have a wealthy friend with extensive connections. I'll ask him if he can find a suitable doctor." [[5766 苏桃 neutral]]
Oh no, is the truth that I'm not a yandere about to be exposed?! [[5767 旁白 neutral]]
A wealthy friend? [[5768 旁白 neutral]]
Exclude that little b*stard Ye Liang first. [[5769 旁白 neutral]]
Is it Dongfang Yang or Si Chen? [[5770 旁白 neutral]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng could think further, she received another message from Su Tao: "By the way, Doctor Cheng, are there any special medicines that can keep the appearance of food the same, but make it taste rotten?" [[5771 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "This... I'm a psychologist, so I don't really know much about that." [[5772 成医生 neutral]]
Peach: "Okay." [[5773 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "However, if you're sure it's not a problem with your taste buds, it might not be medicine. It could also be related to the raw ingredients of the food. You can ask some chef friends." [[5774 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed. She didn't have many friends to begin with. [[5775 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, thinking about such things was too troublesome. [[5776 旁白 neutral]]
Anyway, it's all in the past. In the dark room... besides the bad memories, there were other feelings too. [[5777 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's fingertips rubbed her lips, as if recalling Chi Xiaocheng's softness. [[5778 旁白 neutral]]
Peach: "Doctor Cheng, thank you for all your trouble during this time." [[5779 苏桃 neutral]]
A 200 yuan red packet was sent. [[5780 旁白 neutral]]
Peach: "Sorry, I don't have much money right now. I'll pay you back after I get my part-time job salary at the end of the month." [[5781 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng naturally accepted the 200 yuan, "Didn't I tell you? You don't need to do this until it shows results. This 200 yuan is enough for a month's consultation fee. I'll feel more at ease if I accept it, and you can still come to me with any questions later." [[5782 成医生 neutral]]
Peach: "Thank you, Doctor. I'll ask my friends if they know any doctors in this field first." [[5783 苏桃 neutral]]
As she finished speaking, Chi Xiaocheng gasped. [[5784 旁白 neutral]]
Oh no, is the truth that I'm not a yandere about to be exposed?! [[5785 旁白 neutral]]
