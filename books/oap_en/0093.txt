Chapter 93: Two Psychologists [[8121 旁白 neutral]]
December 3rd. [[8122 旁白 neutral]]
The sun was shining, but a light snow was falling continuously. [[8123 旁白 neutral]]
Today, all freshmen at Jiuzhou University had their classes canceled. To take care of the students' mental health, Young Master Si and Young Master Dongfang jointly funded free check-ups for all freshmen. [[8124 旁白 neutral]]
And this happened to be the time that Doctor Lin and Chi Xiaocheng had scheduled for a psychological evaluation. [[8125 旁白 neutral]]
If I hadn't known about this in advance, I probably would have been kept in the dark. [[8126 池小橙 neutral]]
All the freshmen being diagnosed together... what a great excuse. [[8127 池小橙 neutral]]
But Tao Tao, the psychologist is on my side. You don't really think he can diagnose anything, do you? [[8128 池小橙 neutral]]
At least, that's what Chi Xiaocheng thought before the evaluation began. [[8129 旁白 neutral]]
That was until she reluctantly queued up with her "sister" from the dorm, Zeng Xiu Hua, and blankly overheard the students in front of her talking. [[8130 旁白 neutral]]
"There are two psychologists for the evaluation?" [[8131 池小橙 neutral]]
Zeng Xiu Hua, who was beside her, nodded. "Yeah, there are two rounds. The first round is with Si Chen's doctor, and the second is with the one Dongfang Yang invited." [[8132 曾秀花 neutral]]
"Wait a minute." Chi Xiaocheng rubbed her temples. "You're saying Dongfang Yang invited one too? Is it really necessary to have two doctors?" [[8133 池小橙 neutral]]
Zeng Xiu Hua shrugged. "Who knows? It's probably for prestige. They're funding it together, so whoever brings in a doctor gets more recognition. They couldn't agree, so maybe they each invited one." [[8134 曾秀花 neutral]]
*Hiss—* [[8135 池小橙 neutral]]
If that's the case, then something is very wrong! [[8136 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng quickly sent a message to Si Chen, "What's this about two psychologists?" [[8137 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "It was unexpected. Su Tao didn't just ask me for help, she also went to Dongfang Yang. She probably thought that if one doctor wasn't enough, she would try with two to diagnose you." [[8138 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Your plan with Doctor Lin is probably useless now. They'll likely review both doctors' evaluation reports together." [[8139 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was silent for a moment, then asked, "So what should I do?" [[8140 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Just deal with it?" [[8141 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Do you think you're being funny?" [[8142 池小橙 angry]]
Si Chen: "Just play it by ear. I can't interfere with Dongfang Yang. Worst case, just pretend this therapy session never happened. You're not a yandere, are you?" [[8143 司辰 neutral]]
"That's true." [[8144 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded in agreement. [[8145 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen really sees things clearly. [[8146 池小橙 neutral]]
The System actually suspected I was a real yandere. Look at Si Chen, even a psychology student says I'm not. [[8147 池小橙 neutral]]
"System, is it possible to upgrade my skills?" [[8148 池小橙 neutral]]
She felt that her intermediate acting skill wasn't quite enough anymore. [[8149 旁白 neutral]]
If she had an ultimate acting skill, she might be able to fool Dongfang Yang's doctor. [[8150 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, skills can only be upgraded by drawing a duplicate skill from the gacha] [[8151 系统 neutral]]
"With those odds, I'd have a better chance winning the lottery!" [[8152 池小橙 angry]]
Do you know how long it takes to save up 1000 Emotion Points? [[8153 池小橙 angry]]
Just then, Chi Xiaocheng, who was still in line, was suddenly pulled by Zeng Xiu Hua. [[8154 旁白 neutral]]
"Chengcheng, look over there. That Su Tao girl is here." [[8155 曾秀花 neutral]]
Her eyes were full of hostility, looking at Su Tao as if she wanted to tear her apart. [[8156 旁白 neutral]]
During these two months of university, the original owner of the body wore ugly makeup, was hostile to Su Tao, and made all sorts of mistakes, largely instigated by this Zeng Xiu Hua. [[8157 旁白 neutral]]
She constantly manipulated the original owner, making her believe that she was her only true friend. [[8158 旁白 neutral]]
Even after Chi Xiaocheng transmigrated, she kept nagging her, saying she was prettier with makeup and that she shouldn't go out bare-faced. [[8159 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng hadn't been to school for a few days, and as soon as she arrived, she ran into this "sister." [[8160 旁白 neutral]]
Just like before, she said some negative things to Chi Xiaocheng. [[8161 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't know that inside this small body, the soul had already changed. [[8162 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao walking over, Chi Xiaocheng had an idea. She turned her back and said to Zeng Xiu Hua, "The psychologist's evaluation is open all day, right? There are so many people now, it'll take a long time to wait. Why don't we come back this afternoon?" [[8163 池小橙 neutral]]
"Sure!" Zeng Xiu Hua agreed, glancing at Su Tao with annoyance. "I don't want to see that bitch anyway." [[8164 曾秀花 angry]]
As the word "bitch" was said, a red light flashed in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[8165 旁白 neutral]]
But she quickly suppressed it. [[8166 旁白 neutral]]
Her intermediate acting skill activated, and she revealed a cute, expectant smile. "Didn't you say you have new makeup? Let's go try it. I haven't had money to buy any recently." [[8167 池小橙 happy]]
"Okay, okay, okay!" [[8168 曾秀花 happy]]
Zeng Xiu Hua said "okay" three times, pulled Chi Xiaocheng out of the line, her lips curling up high. [[8169 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng really is still that idiot. [[8170 曾秀花 happy]]
Such a waste of a pretty face. [[8171 曾秀花 neutral]]
But this is perfect. I specially prepared this new makeup. Let's see if your face doesn't rot in a month! [[8172 曾秀花 happy]]
A jealous gaze followed Chi Xiaocheng from behind. [[8173 旁白 neutral]]
It instantly triggered Chi Xiaocheng's newly acquired alertness skill. [[8174 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng didn't say anything, instead taking out her phone to message Su Tao. [[8175 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, where are you? I'm at school but I can't find you. My roommate is calling me back to the dorm, so I'll wait for you there." [[8176 池小橙 neutral]]
In the distance, Su Tao had been walking over. [[8177 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at her phone, puzzled. [[8178 旁白 neutral]]
She had been wondering why Chi Xiaocheng walked away when she saw her, but it turned out Xiaocheng hadn't seen her. [[8179 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[8180 旁白 neutral]]
The word "roommate" made Su Tao's expression turn sour. [[8181 旁白 angry]]
Not long after, once Chi Xiaocheng was back in the dorm, Zeng Xiu Hua sat her down at a simple dressing table. [[8182 旁白 neutral]]
Another roommate said cheerfully, "Xiaocheng, you're back! I haven't seen you in so long, I missed you so much." [[8183 舍友 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng gave the roommate a dry laugh but didn't say anything. [[8184 旁白 neutral]]
The roommate came closer and said slowly, "By the way, has your amazing brother given you any living money? We were hoping your brother would treat us to a meal. He's so capable, he wouldn't be stingy, right?" [[8185 舍友 neutral]]
Her words sounded like admiration. [[8186 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng could clearly hear the sarcasm. [[8187 旁白 neutral]]
They were encouraging the original owner to ask her brother for money. [[8188 旁白 neutral]]
And then spend all of the original owner's money on themselves. [[8189 旁白 neutral]]
It's a good thing the original owner was naive and easy to bully. Anyone else would have exploded at them by now. [[8190 旁白 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't answer the roommate and changed the subject. "Xiu Hua, let's try your new makeup first." [[8191 池小橙 neutral]]
"Okay." [[8192 曾秀花 happy]]
Zeng Xiu Hua took out a pile of bottles and jars and said to Chi Xiaocheng, "These are all new products. I can't even bear to use them myself. After using these, Chengcheng, your skin will be even better." [[8193 曾秀花 happy]]
In Chi Xiaocheng's obedient smile, there was a hint of danger. [[8194 旁白 neutral]]
The toner was applied to Chi Xiaocheng's face and was quickly diluted into a harmless liquid by her 'liquid adulteration' skill. [[8195 旁白 neutral]]
Foundation, blush, eyeliner, and that creepy, fiery red lipstick. [[8196 旁白 neutral]]
The cute, collagen-filled face was quickly covered by the makeup, turning into a zombie-white, ugly mess. [[8197 旁白 neutral]]
Her appearance dropped by several levels. [[8198 旁白 neutral]]
However, this was exactly the effect Chi Xiaocheng wanted. [[8199 旁白 neutral]]
The mistakes the original owner made two months ago should now be completely cleared in Su Tao's eyes. [[8200 旁白 neutral]]
She timed it perfectly. Just as the makeup was almost finished, Su Tao knocked on the door and walked in. [[8201 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed to already know the personalities of Chi Xiaocheng's roommates, and her face was a bit gloomy. [[8202 旁白 neutral]]
And the well-prepared Chi Xiaocheng, with her heavily made-up face, looked at Su Tao. Even her cute smile seemed creepy. [[8203 旁白 neutral]]
She said in an innocent voice, "Tao Tao, Xiu Hua said this is the newest makeup. Do I look cute like this?" [[8204 池小橙 happy]]
