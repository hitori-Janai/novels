Chapter 262: Who Wants to Sleep in the Same Bed as You? [[22323 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled, not pointing out Su Tao's little trick. "It's nothing. Let's bring the things inside first. I'll take this Big Big Wolf back to my room." [[22324 池小橙 neutral]]
With that, she jumped up and took the Big Big Wolf doll from behind Su Tao. But she had taken off her boots and hadn't put on slippers, her white-socked feet padding on the floor as she trotted toward her room. [[22325 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao shook her head helplessly, changed her shoes, and picked up a pair of fuzzy slippers before walking inside. [[22326 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, you still need to wear shoes, you know?" [[22327 苏桃 neutral]]
Walking through the living room, she arrived at Chi Xiaocheng's door, only to find Chi Xiaocheng standing there in a daze. [[22328 旁白 neutral]]
"What's wrong now? I've barely touched anything in the room." [[22329 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao walked into the room, her tone natural with a hint of pride. [[22330 旁白 neutral]]
This room was filled with wonderful memories of her and Chi Xiaocheng. [[22331 旁白 neutral]]
All this time, she had barely moved anything, keeping it all neat and tidy. [[22332 旁白 neutral]]
Her goal was that when Chi Xiaocheng returned, she would remember the good times. [[22333 旁白 neutral]]
The living room, bathroom, and kitchen all held some bad memories, but this room alone had always been so warm and peaceful. [[22334 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't want Xiaocheng to remember the painful memories, but at the same time, she wanted her to recall the wonderful things from the past. [[22335 旁白 neutral]]
She was indeed being a bit selfish. [[22336 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted Chi Xiaocheng to forget the pain, to forget her yandere side. [[22337 旁白 neutral]]
And at the same time, to remember her deep love for her. [[22338 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao knew that such an extreme wish was unlikely to come true, but she couldn't help but fantasize and try to make it happen. [[22339 旁白 neutral]]
The room's arrangement was one of her attempts. [[22340 旁白 neutral]]
Every detail, big and small, was exactly the same as when Chi Xiaocheng had left two months ago. [[22341 旁白 neutral]]
This way, even if the scene brought back feelings, they would hopefully be good ones, right? [[22342 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't notice that as Chi Xiaocheng stared blankly at the room, she clutched her head in pain. [[22343 旁白 sad]]
After a moment, she took a breath and reached out to steady herself on the doorframe, dropping the Big Big Wolf doll. [[22344 旁白 neutral]]
The soft thud finally brought Su Tao back to her senses. She quickly turned and supported the girl, "Xiaocheng, are you okay?" [[22345 苏桃 neutral]]
"Tao... Sister Su Tao..." [[22346 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's tone was hesitant, and she still held her head as if she was remembering something. [[22347 旁白 neutral]]
A flicker of joy appeared on Su Tao's face. [[22348 旁白 happy]]
The first thing Xiaocheng said was "Tao," not "Sister Su Tao." [[22349 旁白 happy]]
Could it be that in that instant, she wanted to call me Taotao? [[22350 苏桃 happy]]
And the headache now, could it be that she's remembering something from the past? [[22351 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao's breathing slowed. She half-expected the Xiaocheng she was holding to turn and fall into her arms. [[22352 旁白 neutral]]
However, she waited for a long time, but the embrace never came. [[22353 旁白 sad]]
Instead, Chi Xiaocheng looked up, her eyes clear again as she looked at her. "Sister Su Tao, have... have you been sleeping in my room this whole time I was sick?" [[22354 池小橙 neutral]]
Now it was Su Tao's turn to be stunned. [[22355 旁白 neutral]]
She asked in confusion, "Xiaocheng, what are you talking about? If I don't sleep in your room, where would I sleep?" [[22356 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned slightly. "Although... although we sometimes sleep together, it's probably not right to do it all the time. Sister Su Tao, you should go back to sleeping in my brother's room." [[22357 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's confused expression gradually turned to shock. [[22358 旁白 neutral]]
Then, disbelief. [[22359 旁白 neutral]]
She retorted almost instinctively, "Xiaocheng, what do you mean go to your brother's room? Haven't we always slept together? You..." [[22360 苏桃 sad]]
Before she could finish, Chi Xiaocheng interrupted her with a wave of her hand. [[22361 旁白 neutral]]
She turned, her eyes filled with the same confusion as Su Tao's. "Aren't you the one being strange, Sister Su Tao? We've always slept separately. You sleep in my brother's room, I sleep in mine. We only sleep together about once a week." [[22362 池小橙 neutral]]
Her words were simple, as if stating a fact. [[22363 旁白 neutral]]
A distorted "fact" that existed only in Chi Xiaocheng's memories. [[22364 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao understood now and could see why Chi Xiaocheng would say such a thing. [[22365 旁白 neutral]]
But... how could this memory be so wrong! [[22366 苏桃 sad]]
The memories of sleeping together were only good, not bad, right? This has nothing to do with being yandere, so why would this be mixed up too? [[22367 苏桃 sad]]
When Xiaocheng clutched her head in pain just now, what did she remember? [[22368 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't figure it out and only felt the sense of wrongness growing stronger. [[22369 旁白 neutral]]
The Xiaocheng before her was still the familiar Xiaocheng from the hospital, not inexplicably hostile like before. [[22370 旁白 neutral]]
She just continued in a flat tone, "Alright, Sister Su Tao, don't just stand there. You should move your pillow and things back to your room. Even though my room is a bit warmer, you can't just take it over like this!" [[22371 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing her words, Su Tao quickly hid her flustered expression. [[22372 旁白 neutral]]
She forced a smile, reacting quickly, "But I want to sleep with Xiaocheng. How about I just... don't move back?" [[22373 苏桃 neutral]]
"Besides, Brother Chi Song came home to stay for a while, and he's sleeping in his own room, so that's why I moved into your room." [[22374 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao's mind raced for a reason. [[22375 旁白 neutral]]
She remembered what Dr. Cheng had said before. [[22376 旁白 neutral]]
If the patient shows unexpected memory confusion, don't force her to remember and don't get stuck on that topic. [[22377 旁白 neutral]]
First, go along with her memory to create a plausible lie, then analyze why it happened and consider a solution. [[22378 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't let Xiaocheng think she was being difficult, nor could she mess up her memories. With her mind racing, Su Tao came up with the reason for Chi Song's return. [[22379 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, after she said this, Chi Xiaocheng's slightly furrowed brow relaxed. [[22380 旁白 happy]]
"Oh, so that's how it is." [[22381 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing the girl's voice, Su Tao quickly added, "Ye-yes, and I've... I've gotten used to sleeping in Xiaocheng's room, so let's not switch back, okay?" [[22382 苏桃 neutral]]
"We used to sleep together before, so we can just continue now." [[22383 苏桃 neutral]]
Although their relationship was gradually improving, if they couldn't even sleep together... [[22384 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao bit her lip, looking at Chi Xiaocheng with anticipation. [[22385 旁白 happy]]
The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. [[22386 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's hopes were dashed. [[22387 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's tone became rejecting. "Let's not. We're not kids anymore. We should have our own private space. Let's just do what we did before. You sleep in my brother's room, Sister Su Tao, and I'll sleep in my own." [[22388 池小橙 neutral]]
She looked at the large brown bear doll in the corner. "That doll, Sister Su Tao, you should take it back to your room." [[22389 池小橙 neutral]]
Then Chi Xiaocheng added, "If it ever breaks, you can just throw it away." [[22390 池小橙 neutral]]
After saying that, Chi Xiaocheng went over to the large brown bear and moved it aside. [[22391 旁白 neutral]]
Its original spot was now occupied by the over 1-meter-tall Big Big Wolf doll. [[22392 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly turned around. "What's wrong, Sister Su Tao? Do you need my help carrying your things out?" [[22393 池小橙 neutral]]
The eviction notice had been served. [[22394 旁白 sad]]
In that instant, Su Tao felt as if her breathing had stopped. [[22395 旁白 sad]]
The fleeting thought from before resurfaced in her mind. [[22396 旁白 neutral]]
Was the distance between her and Xiaocheng really closing? [[22397 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng didn't hate her as much anymore. [[22398 旁白 neutral]]
She would also affectionately call her Sister Su Tao. [[22399 旁白 neutral]]
But now, she didn't even have the chance to sleep with Xiaocheng anymore. [[22400 苏桃 sad]]
