Chapter 126: So, the one who wasn't normal was me. [[11105 旁白 neutral]]
The freezing water covered her nose and mouth, and Su Tao felt it becoming more and more difficult to breathe. [[11106 旁白 sad]]
A person stood on the shore watching her. No matter how she struggled or begged for help, they refused to reach out and save her. [[11107 旁白 sad]]
The pain, suffocation, and the feeling of her body sinking little by little while losing warmth terrified her. She struggled with all her might and finally saw the figure on the shore clearly. [[11108 旁白 sad]]
That person's face... was her own? [[11109 苏桃 sad]]
Then who was the person about to drown in the water? [[11110 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao looked down and realized she no longer felt the suffocating sensation of drowning. [[11111 旁白 neutral]]
The cold lake in front of her slowly turned into a bathtub, and the submerged figure had somehow become Chi Xiaocheng. [[11112 旁白 sad]]
The figure was looking at her with resentment. [[11113 旁白 angry]]
It was as if she was questioning and cursing, "Why didn't you save me? You could have reached out, why did you just watch me drown and not save me!" [[11114 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao's lips were dry. She held her head in her hands and shook it madly, murmuring, "No... it's not that I didn't want to save you, and it's not that I don't want you, I... I..." [[11115 苏桃 sad]]
Before she could finish, the Xiaocheng in the bathtub was completely submerged in crimson water. [[11116 旁白 sad]]
"Xiaocheng!" [[11117 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao suddenly woke up from her dream. She sat up and reached out to grab something in the air, but she couldn't touch anything. [[11118 旁白 neutral]]
She gasped for air, and her blurry vision gradually cleared. Her splitting headache and the familiar living room made her realize it had all been a dream. [[11119 旁白 neutral]]
After calming down a bit, Su Tao suddenly shouted, "Where is Xiaocheng? How is she!" [[11120 苏桃 sad]]
A long-legged woman in a sweater, leaning on the other side of the sofa, yawned. "You're awake. Your Xiaocheng is out of danger. She's in Dongfang Yang's private hospital, so please don't worry." [[11121 钱清 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao felt greatly relieved. "Really?" [[11122 苏桃 happy]]
"I waited here for you to wake up because I was afraid you'd do something foolish. Are you feeling any better?" [[11123 钱清 neutral]]
She wasn't carrying the scented sachet, so after sleeping, Su Tao didn't feel much better. In fact, she felt even more tired. [[11124 旁白 neutral]]
She held her forehead, forcing herself to understand the situation. "I'm so sorry to have troubled you. May I ask who you are?" [[11125 苏桃 neutral]]
"My name is Qian Qing." Qian Qing stood up and poured Su Tao a glass of hot water. "I guess you could say I'm one of Dongfang Yang's few friends. He asked me to take care of you." [[11126 钱清 neutral]]
"Thank you." Su Tao took a sip of the hot water. Even though it was very hot, she felt her body warm up a lot. [[11127 苏桃 neutral]]
She looked at Qian Qing and asked hesitantly, "Um, Miss Qian... do you know the specifics of Xiaocheng's condition?" [[11128 苏桃 sad]]
"The rescue was successful, but she's still in a coma. Her life was saved, but it's unclear if there will be any side effects." Qian Qing said lightly, then asked curiously, "I know this might bring up bad memories, but I'm still very curious." [[11129 钱清 neutral]]
"What on earth did you do to that little one to make her so desperate that she chose to leave this world?" [[11130 钱清 neutral]]
She pointed to the suicide note in Su Tao's hand. "Can I see that?" [[11131 钱清 neutral]]
Su Tao pressed her lips together and handed the note to Qian Qing. [[11132 旁白 neutral]]
She blamed herself, saying, "It's all my fault. Xiaocheng... she likes me. She confessed to me, and I didn't accept." [[11133 苏桃 sad]]
"Huh?!" [[11134 钱清 neutral]]
Before she could even read the note, Qian Qing was shocked by Su Tao's words. "Dongfang Yang told me she saw you as family. What's this about a confession..." [[11135 钱清 neutral]]
"Dongfang Yang must have misunderstood." Su Tao hadn't told him about Chi Xiaocheng. "The truth is that Xiaocheng likes me, with a very sick and twisted love. She has dissociative identity disorder and is a yandere. I didn't accept her when she confessed." [[11136 苏桃 sad]]
"Then, even though I never told her about the marriage agreement or Xiao Ming, she somehow found out." [[11137 苏桃 sad]]
"Finally... she had an emotional breakdown, thinking I didn't want her anymore, so..." [[11138 苏桃 sad]]
She didn't continue, but Qian Qing already understood the situation. [[11139 旁白 neutral]]
She had heard a little about yandere before. [[11140 旁白 neutral]]
She had thought it was just a trait fantasized by lonely netizens in anime, but she never expected to see it in real life. [[11141 旁白 neutral]]
As if seeking validation, Su Tao said to Qian Qing, "Miss Qian, you also think this is not right, don't you? I... although I grew up with Xiaocheng, I always treated her like a little sister. I never had those kinds of feelings for her." [[11142 苏桃 sad]]
"But she kept saying she liked me. Even putting that aside, a girl with another girl is... too strange, right?" [[11143 苏桃 sad]]
Qian Qing opened the suicide note and said calmly, "There's nothing strange about it. Maybe the environment you grew up in was too simple. In the chaotic upper circles, there are things you can't even imagine." [[11144 钱清 neutral]]
"Let's take a simple example. There are countless families and many young masters and ladies. The elite schools they create are something all commoners look up to." [[11145 钱清 neutral]]
"To the outside world, every young master and lady is so outstanding. But only people on our side know that even a beautiful and excellent young lady, once at school, will just take off her pants and play with others." [[11146 钱清 neutral]]
Qian Qing ignored Su Tao's stunned expression and continued calmly, "Don't find it strange. To you, this is unbelievable and beyond reason, but to those young masters and ladies, physical interaction is just a way to relax and have fun." [[11147 钱清 neutral]]
"You can't imagine the decadent lifestyle of the rich, and I don't want someone like you to think about it." [[11148 钱清 neutral]]
"There are plenty of same-sex couples. They are all seeking excitement, while your Xiaocheng is only seeking true love." [[11149 钱清 neutral]]
Qian Qing herself couldn't stand that messy circle, which is why she gave up her family's support and ran off to make a living on her own. [[11150 旁白 neutral]]
Just like Dongfang Yang, who would rather be a useless young master used as a bad example by other families than cater to such ugliness. [[11151 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao fell silent. [[11152 旁白 sad]]
She couldn't help but think of what Dr. Cheng had said. [[11153 旁白 sad]]
As a doctor, he had seen many cases of girls being with other girls. [[11154 旁白 neutral]]
Even Chen Qian and Xiao Wei thought it was normal. [[11155 旁白 neutral]]
So, it turns out I was the only one who thought it was strange. [[11156 苏桃 sad]]
And based on that, I kept trying to avoid Xiaocheng? [[11157 苏桃 sad]]
Qian Qing placed the suicide note back on the table. "Can you stand up?" [[11158 钱清 neutral]]
"I can..." [[11159 苏桃 neutral]]
"I've cleaned the bathroom for you. Try not to think too much. Take a bath, get a good night's sleep, and go see your Xiaocheng at the hospital tomorrow when you've recovered your strength. I'm tired too. Can I borrow a guest room?" [[11160 钱清 neutral]]
"Just a moment, I'll get it ready for you." [[11161 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao wanted to force herself not to think about those things, just as Qian Qing had said, but she couldn't. [[11162 旁白 sad]]
While bathing, every time she saw the bathtub, the image of Chi Xiaocheng lying in it would flash in her mind. [[11163 旁白 sad]]
It made her retch for a long time without relief. [[11164 旁白 sad]]
After the bath, she felt even more exhausted. [[11165 旁白 sad]]
Finally, she returned listlessly to Chi Xiaocheng's room. The living room was a mess, and the kitchen showed signs of broken dishes, but this room alone seemed specially preserved for her as a memory. [[11166 旁白 sad]]
It was neat and spotless. [[11167 旁白 neutral]]
She buried her face in the bed, faintly smelling the scent of Chi Xiaocheng that lingered from her sleeping here. [[11168 旁白 sad]]
It was... a scent as comforting as the sachet. [[11169 旁白 sad]]
Tears blurred her vision again without her noticing. [[11170 旁白 sad]]
If none of this had happened. [[11171 苏桃 sad]]
If she had accepted Chi Xiaocheng's confession. [[11172 苏桃 sad]]
Then right now, she would probably be on this bed, holding that small, soft body while sleeping, right? [[11173 苏桃 sad]]
But in this world, there are no "ifs." [[11174 旁白 sad]]
And if there were, it would surely only be in a dream. [[11175 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao lay on her side, and her eyes fell on a figurine on the nightstand. Her expression was a bit dazed. [[11176 旁白 neutral]]
"When did such an exquisite figurine appear here?" [[11177 苏桃 neutral]]
"Are the two people on it... me and Xiaocheng?" [[11178 苏桃 neutral]]
