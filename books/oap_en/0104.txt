Chapter 104: Possess Her, and She Will Surely Be Yours! [[8982 旁白 neutral]]

At 1:30 AM, just as Su Tao finished a rush job on a poster for the school's publicity department, turned off her computer, and got into bed, she received a call from Chi Xiaocheng. [[8983 旁白 neutral]]
At this hour, Chen Qian was already in bed with a small lamp on, staying up late to read a novel. [[8984 旁白 neutral]]
Her roommate, Xiao Wei, had been snoring nonstop. [[8985 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao knew Chi Xiaocheng well. If it wasn't important, she would never call so late and risk waking her up. [[8986 旁白 neutral]]
She answered the phone and asked what was wrong. [[8987 旁白 neutral]]
But the voice she heard was trembling slightly. [[8988 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao... do you really like me?" [[8989 池小橙 sad]]
The question came without any context or reason; nothing special had even happened all day. [[8990 旁白 neutral]]
Why was she asking this? [[8991 旁白 neutral]]
Did someone say something to Xiaocheng? [[8992 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a faint sense of unease. After a moment of silent thought, she spoke in the gentlest voice she could manage, "Xiaocheng, what are you talking about? Of course I like you." [[8993 苏桃 neutral]]
Even if it was a lie, she couldn't let it show. [[8994 旁白 neutral]]
However, the person on the other end of the line seemed extremely paranoid and seized on her momentary hesitation. [[8995 旁白 neutral]]
"If you like me... then why did you hesitate before answering?" [[8996 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao was stunned. "Xiaocheng?" [[8997 苏桃 sad]]
"Beep, beep, beep—" [[8998 旁白 neutral]]
She looked down at her phone screen; the call had been disconnected. [[8999 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian poked her head out and asked, "What happened?" [[9000 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao pressed her lips together. "I don't know, but Xiaocheng seems a little emotionally unstable." [[9001 苏桃 neutral]]
With that, she grabbed a coat and threw it over her shoulders. "I'm going out for a bit." [[9002 苏桃 neutral]]
"You're going over at this hour?!" [[9003 陈倩 neutral]]
Chen Qian glanced out the window, where the dim light revealed ice on the glass and heavy, swirling snow. [[9004 旁白 neutral]]
"There's no need, right? The snow is so heavy, you'll have a hard time getting a cab. Besides, you have an 8 AM class tomorrow. If you skip Old Man Zhu's lecture, you'll have to retake the course." [[9005 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao pulled on her gloves and scarf, letting out a breath. "I'm worried. I should go check on her." [[9006 苏桃 neutral]]
She reached out and shook her roommate's bed. "Xiao Wei, where's your bike?" [[9007 苏桃 neutral]]
The snoring stopped abruptly, replaced by a lazy voice, "Parking spot 21, next to the public area in Block B~" [[9008 小唯 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded and hurried out without another moment's delay. [[9009 旁白 neutral]]
Watching her leave, Chen Qian shook her head with pity. "Always having to take care of Chi Xiaocheng's feelings. She's already so tired, yet she still has to run over at the slightest disturbance. I really don't know if being liked by someone like that is a good or a bad thing." [[9010 陈倩 neutral]]
Xiao Wei's lazy voice piped up again, "Why worry about her so much? Turn off the lights and let's sleep!" [[9011 小唯 neutral]]
Chen Qian's mouth twitched. "Why don't you get out of bed and turn them off? Were you even asleep?" [[9012 陈倩 neutral]]
Xiao Wei didn't answer. The faint sound of snoring started up again. [[9013 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, after hanging up the phone, Chi Xiaocheng sat on the floor like a lost soul, leaning against the bed frame. [[9014 旁白 neutral]]
The air conditioner was on in the room. [[9015 旁白 neutral]]
But she felt a bone-chilling cold. [[9016 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind was filled with the words her other self had said. [[9017 旁白 neutral]]
"Do you really like Su Tao? And does Su Tao really like you?" [[9018 旁白 neutral]]
And a tide of false memories washed over her. [[9019 旁白 neutral]]
Was that dream real? [[9020 旁白 neutral]]
Did I go crazy in the past? [[9021 旁白 neutral]]
All because I loved that damned woman too much? [[9022 旁白 neutral]]
Are my feelings for Su Tao love, or possession, or neither? [[9023 旁白 neutral]]
Am I... not normal anymore? [[9024 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng clutched her head in pain. She could recognize it was just a dream, that its contents were likely fictional and not real. [[9025 旁白 neutral]]
But every time she thought about the ways her ex-girlfriend had deceived her, a sharp pain shot through her heart, as if someone was constantly whispering in her ear that it was all true. [[9026 旁白 neutral]]
The pathology report in the dream clearly stated "selective amnesia." [[9027 旁白 neutral]]
Was it forged, or did she really have amnesia and that's why she had no such memories? [[9028 旁白 neutral]]
Were the memories of being cooped up in her room for three months real? [[9029 旁白 neutral]]
Which side is reality? [[9030 旁白 neutral]]
The memories caused her pain, but they didn't scare her. [[9031 旁白 neutral]]
What she was afraid of was that a girl like Su Tao might also be pretending to like her, just like her ex-girlfriend. [[9032 旁白 neutral]]
That she was just telling a lie called "like" to appease her yandere self. [[9033 旁白 neutral]]
"If even she doesn't want me, what reason do I have to live after crossing over to this world?" [[9034 池小橙 sad]]
The deeper the love, the deeper the pain. [[9035 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't want to experience the pain of being abandoned again! [[9036 旁白 sad]]
But just now, when she asked, Taotao had definitely hesitated. [[9037 旁白 neutral]]
Once the seed of doubt is planted, it's only a matter of time before it sprouts. Her unstable mind was the catalyst for this seed. [[9038 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng forced herself not to think about it. She was afraid to. [[9039 旁白 neutral]]
Biting the tip of her tongue, Chi Xiaocheng said in a low voice, "System, get me a high-strength tranquilizer shot!" [[9040 池小橙 angry]]
[70 Emotion Points have been deducted] [[9041 系统 neutral]]
The needle pierced her skin, and the advanced tech from the System made Chi Xiaocheng's face twist and twitch for a moment. [[9042 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes gradually cleared, and rationality took over again. [[9_043 旁白 neutral]]
She leaned against the bed, gasping for breath. "System, this isn't like you. You usually would have said something." [[9044 池小橙 neutral]]
[Sorry, Host. Your condition was very strange. I was afraid of affecting you if I spoke.] [[9045 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng held out a bloodless palm, her face stiff. "Tell me, am I a bit abnormal, like the case file in my dream said?" [[9046 池小橙 sad]]
[Host, it was just a dream. You are you.] [[9047 系统 neutral]]
"Will it be better if I just sleep?" [[9048 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng felt the urge to escape. A strong sense of anxiety surrounded her, and she was scared. [[9049 旁白 neutral]]
In all the time since she had crossed over, she had never felt so afraid. [[9050 旁白 neutral]]
She was afraid of betrayal. [[9051 旁白 neutral]]
Afraid that Su Tao would abandon her. [[9052 旁白 sad]]
She even felt terrified of her own past actions when she pretended to be a yandere. [[9053 旁白 neutral]]
"If... and I'm just saying if..." [[9054 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly asked the System, "If I put too much pressure on Taotao and she can't take it, will she abandon me, leave me, and send me to a mental hospital?" [[9055 池小橙 sad]]
All her confidence came from Su Tao's feelings for the original owner of the body, from Su Tao's 'white moonlight' personality that she admired and longed for. [[9056 旁白 neutral]]
But in the original novel, didn't Su Tao give up on the original owner too? [[9057 旁白 sad]]
If she's only pretending to like me, then what's the point of everything I've done? [[9058 池小橙 sad]]
What you can't have, you can never truly possess. [[9059 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, I suggest you take a pill and get some sleep.] [[9060 系统 neutral]]
"I just woke up!" [[9061 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng clutched her head again. [[9062 旁白 neutral]]
"System, do you hear that? There's a voice... a voice that won't stop talking." [[9063 池小橙 sad]]
"Possess her, possess her, possess her, possess her..." [[9064 旁白 neutral]]
"That voice is telling me to possess Taotao..." [[9065 池小橙 neutral]]
As she muttered the words, Chi Xiaocheng froze. [[9066 旁白 neutral]]
In the dream, didn't she also tell her past self to possess someone? [[9067 旁白 neutral]]
"I don't need Taotao to like me, I just need to possess her completely?" [[9068 池小橙 neutral]]
This goal went against everything Chi Xiaocheng had been trying to do. [[9069 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng, Chen Qian, Si Chen, and even Fang Ning, who was recently sent to work in the girls' dorm to get close to Su Tao—she controlled one person after another, constantly squeezing Su Tao's social circle. [[9070 旁白 neutral]]
She even resorted to self-harm, all to make Su Tao focus all her attention on her. [[9071 旁白 neutral]]
And then, through daily interactions, make her slowly fall in love with her. [[9072 旁白 neutral]]
But who could know if that kind of love was real? [[9073 旁白 neutral]]
For two years, her ex-girlfriend had acted like she was so in love with her. [[9074 旁白 sad]]
But the result was betrayal. [[9075 旁白 sad]]
The voice in her ear seemed to speak again: "No one can be sure that Taotao likes you. What if she's pretending, only to betray you when you've fallen completely in love?" [[9076 旁白 neutral]]
"Possess her. Whether she likes you or not, she will be yours!" [[9077 旁白 neutral]]
