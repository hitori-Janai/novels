Chapter 144: The Road of No Return [[12676 旁白 neutral]]
At the entrance of Jiuzhou University, three tall, sturdy men in plainclothes stood under a willow tree, enduring the cold wind as they waited for orders. [[12677 旁白 neutral]]
The leader looked simple and honest, but his eyes were sharp. He said to the other two, "You must remember to follow the young master's orders. If Miss Chi gets into a conflict later, you must protect her immediately to prevent it from getting worse, understand?" [[12678 高寒 neutral]]
His name was Gao Han, one of Si Chen's most capable men. [[12679 旁白 neutral]]
The young master had given special instructions for this mission. They had to take Chi Xiaocheng's matter seriously. If anything unexpected happened that he couldn't handle, he would be feeding the fishes in the river. [[12680 旁白 neutral]]
The two subordinates were clearly not as smart as Gao Han. Although they were strong, they were a bit slow. [[12681 旁白 neutral]]
One of them raised his hand and asked, "Boss, with the three of us following Miss Chi, no one would dare to touch her, right? Are you making too big a deal out of this?" [[12682 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Who asked you to interrupt?" Gao Han glared at his subordinate. "Just listen to me. The young master's orders are..." [[12683 高寒 angry]]
Before he could finish, the sharp-eyed Gao Han spotted a small figure walking towards them from across the road. [[12684 旁白 neutral]]
He immediately shut his mouth and whispered to the two, "Anyway, just act professionally, understand? Follow my lead." [[12685 高寒 neutral]]
When they met, Gao Han noticed that Chi Xiaocheng didn't look happy, so his expression became much more serious. [[12686 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Chi, the young master sent me to help you. You can just call me Xiao Gao." [[12687 高寒 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded lightly. "Did Si Chen tell you what this is about?" [[12688 池小橙 neutral]]
"No, the young master only told us it was to resolve a conflict and that we should listen to you. If anything happens, we are to handle it for you." [[12689 高寒 neutral]]
"Alright, follow me." [[12690 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng already knew she was probably a bit of a yandere. Perhaps from acting the part so often, she slowly found she couldn't take off the mask. [[12691 池小橙 neutral]]
Or maybe she had always been this extreme, she just hadn't realized it. [[12692 池小橙 neutral]]
Now, with her "blackening" skill constantly active, being a yandere had become her normal state, but that didn't mean Chi Xiaocheng had lost her reason. [[12693 旁白 neutral]]
In these peaceful times, even with Si Chen backing her up. [[12694 池小橙 neutral]]
She couldn't just kill someone on the street. [[12695 池小橙 neutral]]
But it was certainly possible to teach this manager named Long Mian a lesson and stand up for Su Tao. [[12696 池小橙 neutral]]
Few people were out on a weekend in the cold winter. With the sub-zero temperatures, university students naturally stayed indoors. [[12697 旁白 neutral]]
The snack supermarket was deserted. [[12698 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as Chi Xiaocheng entered, a clerk at the counter said, "Welcome." [[12699 陌生女1 neutral]]
But after she spoke, her expression slowly grew worried as Gao Han and the others entered. [[12700 旁白 neutral]]
A young girl with three intimidatingly tall and strong men, her face grim—it didn't look like they were here to buy snacks, did it? [[12701 陌生女1 neutral]]
She cautiously asked, "Excuse me, are you here to buy snacks?" [[12702 陌生女1 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled, signaling for the young lady not to be nervous. "Is your manager, Long Mian, here?" [[12703 池小橙 neutral]]
The young lady pointed towards the second floor. "Sister Long is on the second floor. May I ask why you're looking for her...?" [[12704 陌生女1 neutral]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng headed for the second floor without looking back. [[12705 旁白 neutral]]
Gao Han immediately followed. One of his subordinates gave the clerk a slight smile. "Don't come up no matter what you hear. It's best if you lock the door, understand?" [[12706 陌生男1 neutral]]
Obviously, they were here to cause trouble. [[12707 旁白 neutral]]
When they went up to the second floor, they saw a woman in her 40s lounging on the sofa, watching a drama with her legs crossed. She was enjoying the air conditioning and holding a large bag of beef jerky. [[12708 旁白 neutral]]
She was really enjoying herself. [[12709 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng come up, she frowned in displeasure. "Who are you? The snack area is downstairs. Don't you know the second floor is off-limits?" [[12710 隆绵 angry]]
"You're Long Mian?" [[12711 池小橙 neutral]]
Long Mian glanced at Gao Han who followed behind, her tone becoming less aggressive. "I am Long Mian. What do you want?" [[12712 隆绵 neutral]]
"I'm Su Tao's friend." [[12713 池小橙 neutral]]
As soon as the name "Su Tao" was mentioned, Long Mian's eyes filled with disgust. "What, Su Tao isn't coming back to work, so she sent you?" [[12714 隆绵 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng asked, "As the manager here, why are you targeting Su Tao?" [[12715 池小橙 neutral]]
Long Mian sneered. "I get it, you're here to stand up for Su Tao. When did I target her? She came here for a part-time job. If she didn't do it well, is it a problem for me, her boss, to discipline her?" [[12716 隆绵 angry]]
"Besides, what right do you, an outsider, have to meddle in our store's affairs?" [[12717 隆绵 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng laughed after hearing this. [[12718 池小橙 happy]]
Truly the most brainless villain in the original story. [[12719 池小橙 neutral]]
Low intelligence, no logic, and completely fixated on targeting the protagonist after being influenced by the world's will. [[12720 池小橙 neutral]]
Destined to be slapped down by the protagonist, not even surviving for two chapters after their official appearance. [[12721 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned to Gao Han. "Teach her a lesson, then get her out of this position and throw her outside. And contact the owner of this store to replace her. Can you do that?" [[12722 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had originally planned to do it herself. [[12723 旁白 neutral]]
But now, she couldn't be bothered to deal with this person. [[12724 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since she left her apartment complex, her vigilance skill had been giving her a faint warning. [[12725 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew someone was following and watching her in secret. [[12726 旁白 neutral]]
She planned to head back after dealing with this to avoid any more trouble. [[12727 旁白 neutral]]
But when Long Mian heard Chi Xiaocheng's words, she burst out laughing like a madwoman. "Teach me a lesson? Fire me? Who the hell do you think you are!" [[12728 隆绵 angry]]
"Don't you know the owner of this snack supermarket branch is my uncle? Do you think you can scare me just by bringing someone along? Believe it or not, I'll call the police!" [[12729 隆绵 angry]]
"Call the police?" Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow. [[12730 池小橙 neutral]]
Long Mian thought she was scared and said mockingly, "I see you're just like that bitch Su Tao, looking for a scolding, aren't you? What right do you have to tell me how I treat her?" [[12731 隆绵 angry]]
"With a face like Su Tao's, you must have seduced a lot of men, haven't you?" [[12732 隆绵 angry]]
She continued her taunts and shouted. A strong man came out from a room behind her. [[12733 旁白 neutral]]
With the strong man for backup, she was even less afraid of Gao Han. [[12734 旁白 neutral]]
Her mouth kept running, but she didn't notice Chi Xiaocheng's face growing darker and darker. [[12735 旁白 neutral]]
A fruit knife had appeared in her hand at some point. [[12736 旁白 neutral]]
"Smack!" [[12737 旁白 neutral]]
Her free hand, not holding the knife, slapped Long Mian across the face. [[12738 旁白 neutral]]
A front tooth was knocked out by the immense force, and half of her face quickly swelled up. [[12739 旁白 neutral]]
In her blackened state, Chi Xiaocheng was even stronger than Su Tao! [[12740 旁白 neutral]]
And the last few sentences had sent her blackening multiplier soaring. [[12741 旁白 neutral]]
Long Mian was stunned for a moment, then she furiously reached out a hand. [[12742 旁白 neutral]]
"You little bitch, you dare hit me!" [[12743 隆绵 angry]]
She reached out to grab Chi Xiaocheng's hair. [[12744 旁白 neutral]]
However, a cold light flashed. Before her outstretched hand could stop, her five fingers were severed from her palm. [[12745 旁白 neutral]]
They flew across the living room, splattering droplets of red. [[12746 旁白 neutral]]
The cuts on the fingers were perfectly smooth. [[12747 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's movements were not only fast but also precise and elegant. [[12748 旁白 neutral]]
Her cat-like pupils glowed red, staring intently at Long Mian. "Who... were you just cursing?" [[12749 池小橙 angry]]
You think you can curse my Tao Tao? [[12750 池小橙 angry]]
"Shlick—" Accompanied by a scream, Long Mian didn't even have time to react or see Chi Xiaocheng move. [[12751 旁白 neutral]]
Her fat hand was already falling to the floor. [[12752 旁白 neutral]]
This lightning-fast turn of events caught even Gao Han completely by surprise. [[12753 旁白 neutral]]
He shouted frantically, "Quick, protect the target!" [[12754 高寒 angry]]
"Huh?" a subordinate looked at Gao Han, confused. "Boss, doesn't Miss Chi need our protection?" [[12755 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Idiot, the young master told us to protect the person in conflict with Miss Chi!" [[12756 高寒 angry]]
The scene instantly descended into chaos. [[12757 旁白 neutral]]
To an outsider, it was just a farce. [[12758 旁白 neutral]]
But after venting, Chi Xiaocheng felt incredibly satisfied. [[12759 池小橙 happy]]
I think I really might be a little abnormal, right? [[12760 池小橙 neutral]]
She said to the System in her heart. [[12761 池小橙 neutral]]
At the same time, a call was made to Su Tao's phone. [[12762 旁白 neutral]]
