Chapter 215: Resurrection, Awakening [[18704 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Chi Xiaocheng's words, the System was silent for a while. [[18705 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, you don't have to do this. The female lead, Su Tao, has already started to accept you." [[18706 系统 neutral]]
"But it's just the beginning!" Chi Xiaocheng's voice was clearly anxious. "Look at this favorability score, it's not even 70. For a normal person, confessing with a score this low has a very high chance of failure!" [[18707 池小橙 sad]]
A favorability score of 70 isn't even considered high in dating games. [[18708 旁白 neutral]]
In reality, a confession at this level is rarely accepted on impulse. [[18709 旁白 neutral]]
People consider social status, family background, practical matters, and even the other person's financial situation and character. [[18710 旁白 neutral]]
If I hadn't pretended to be a yandere, Taozi probably wouldn't even have a favorability score of 67! [[18711 池小橙 sad]]
"Besides, her possessiveness towards me has also decreased. Isn't this just like before? If I'm not sick, she doesn't care about me." [[18712 池小橙 sad]]
"I already hinted to her that I don't want a forced confession, but for her to like me on her own. But she didn't pay any attention to what I said and even had such a happy chat with that Tang Tang!" [[18713 池小橙 angry]]
"But they are just friends who haven't seen each other in a long time." [[18714 系统 neutral]]
"What if something happens between them in the future? System, you can't control the world's will when it tries to set traps, can you?" [[18715 池小橙 sad]]
I didn't kill that Chu Lingfeng, and Dongfang Yang and Si Chen also did their best to keep Su Tao from seeing him. [[18716 池小橙 neutral]]
It had only been one night since the birthday banquet. [[18717 旁白 neutral]]
She already met with that 'miracle doctor' male lead and even brought him to the hospital, wanting him to treat me! [[18718 池小橙 angry]]
Sensing that Chi Xiaocheng's emotions were a bit off, [[18719 旁白 neutral]]
The System sighed. [[18720 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, you are too impatient." [[18721 系统 neutral]]
"Love doesn't happen overnight. Everything is developing in a good direction now. You can just follow the steps to win over the female lead." [[18722 系统 neutral]]
"Use your cuteness and sweetness to move her. Over time, she will fall for you." [[18723 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a breath. "Am I impatient?" [[18724 池小橙 neutral]]
"You've developed real feelings. Before, you were a strategist, only thinking about relying on Su Tao to survive. You wanted to save her from the tragic fate of the original story, using layers of scheming and acting to keep her in your palm." [[18725 系统 neutral]]
"Now, you're falling deeper and deeper, becoming more and more afraid that she won't like you, and afraid that what happened in your past life will happen again. But in reality, with Su Tao's personality, she would never ignore you." [[18726 系统 neutral]]
"Do you remember a question you asked me before?" [[18727 系统 neutral]]
As the System spoke, Chi Xiaocheng slowly drifted into her memories, thinking back to how she was at the beginning. [[18728 旁白 neutral]]
Back then, after finishing the original novel, she had asked the System a question that sounded like a joke. [[18729 旁白 neutral]]
"System, do you think it's possible that one day, like the other male leads, I might fall hopelessly in love with Su Tao?" [[18730 池小橙 neutral]]
Just like in many plots of the original novel, many people didn't feel anything for this 'white moonlight' at first. [[18731 旁白 neutral]]
Then, as they spent more time with her, they were attracted by her personality, and their initial good impression slowly turned into love. [[18732 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't even remember when she had fallen in love with Su Tao. [[18733 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, the System continued to speak. [[18734 旁白 neutral]]
"That's why I said you're too impatient, Host. The System store naturally has the amnesia pill you want, but amnesia is too unpredictable." [[18735 系统 neutral]]
"No one can guarantee that you will still fall for Su Tao after losing your memory, and there's no way to guarantee what will happen when your memories return." [[18736 系统 neutral]]
"What if during your amnesia, the world's will tries to eliminate you again, or male lead Chu Lingfeng and the still-missing Xiao Ming and others come to cause trouble?" [[18737 系统 neutral]]
The System's persuasion was sincere, trying to pull Chi Xiaocheng back from her paranoia. [[18738 旁白 neutral]]
It wanted to tell her that winning over Su Tao step-by-step could also lead to a perfect ending. [[18739 旁白 neutral]]
Although this kind of relationship would be somewhat different from what she imagined. [[18740 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was silent for a long time, then took a deep breath. "System, you're right, but I still want to do it that way!" [[18741 池小橙 sad]]
"I don't want another Tang Tang to appear, or another Chu Lingfeng. I also don't want to have an 'episode' and interfere with her social circle, putting more and more pressure on her." [[18742 池小橙 sad]]
"As long as her eyes are only for me, as long as she only cares about and loves me, it's fine to have as many ordinary friends as she wants. But she can only care about me!" [[18743 池小橙 sad]]
She had died twice. [[18744 旁白 neutral]]
The first time was on purpose, the second was an accident. [[18745 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was no longer a threat, but there were still others who wanted to get rid of her. [[18746 旁白 neutral]]
There was also a wealthy female character who would appear in the future, and she didn't know what would happen. [[18747 旁白 neutral]]
She was scared, she was anxious, she couldn't wait that long. [[18748 旁白 sad]]
If one could think completely rationally without any flaws, they wouldn't be called a yandere. [[18749 旁白 neutral]]
But if it were before, she probably wouldn't have listened to anything the System said. [[18750 旁白 neutral]]
The favorability from love was growing too slowly, and the possessiveness was getting lower. [[18751 旁白 neutral]]
How can Taotao's eyes be full of me like this? [[18752 池小橙 sad]]
Of course, direct amnesia was too unpredictable. She scanned the System store several times. [[18753 旁白 neutral]]
She had another, more advanced idea. [[18754 旁白 neutral]]
It was a new day, and Su Tao went about improving herself with her usual sense of anticipation. [[18755 旁白 neutral]]
After her morning exercise came breakfast, and then she went to work at the cafe. [[18756 旁白 neutral]]
With only 10 days until the New Year, the streets were already bustling. When she arrived at the cafe, Chu San kindly told her, [[18757 旁白 neutral]]
He was also going home for the New Year, and Dongfang Yang had said to handle the cafe's business after the holiday. [[18758 旁白 neutral]]
She used to spend most of her day studying here. Now that a part of that was gone, she felt a sense of emptiness. [[18759 旁白 sad]]
If she wasn't going to work, what would she do with her time? [[18760 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up at the perfectly clear sky. [[18761 旁白 neutral]]
With a "ding," a text message from the weather bureau arrived on her phone. [[18762 旁白 neutral]]
"Today's weather will change from sunny to showers. Citizens are advised to bring an umbrella when going out." [[18763 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at it and pouted. "The sun is shining so brightly, is it really going to rain? The weather forecast is so inaccurate." [[18764 苏桃 neutral]]
She put her phone away and took a breath. "Oh well, I'll go to the hospital and see Xiaocheng." [[18765 苏桃 neutral]]
She didn't take a taxi, but instead walked to experience the city's morning sun. With every step she took towards the hospital, her anticipation grew. [[18766 旁白 neutral]]
She thought: I wonder if Xiaocheng will wake up at this moment? [[18767 苏桃 happy]]
Then she wondered if she was being too greedy. [[18768 旁白 neutral]]
Walking slowly to the hospital entrance, Su Tao suddenly ran into someone she didn't know well, but felt a little guilty towards. [[18769 旁白 neutral]]
Because of long-term malnutrition, Fang Ning, who was even thinner than Chi Xiaocheng, met Su Tao's gaze at the hospital entrance. [[18770 旁白 neutral]]
The small girl didn't even wait for Su Tao to call out to her. She pulled down the brim of her hat and turned back the way she came. [[18771 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed anxious and hurried. [[18772 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao reached out her hand, but the words to stop her wouldn't come out. [[18773 旁白 sad]]
She then remembered that she usually visited Xiaocheng at night, and to deliberately avoid her, Fang Ning would go in the morning and at noon. [[18774 旁白 neutral]]
"Sigh." Su Tao moved her lips but only a soft sigh escaped, and she continued walking into the hospital. [[18775 苏桃 sad]]
The nurse on duty had known Chi Xiaocheng for a long time and had even been a fan of the two of them. [[18776 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao, she smiled and greeted her, "Good morning, Miss Su Tao. Are you here to see Miss Chengzi again? She's in her room, and she's awake now." [[18777 陌生女1 happy]]
Su Tao subconsciously replied, "Thank you, nurse, for always taking care of Xiaocheng. I... wait a minute." [[18778 苏桃 happy]]
Her eyes widened as she looked at the nurse in realization. "What did you just say?" [[18779 苏桃 happy]]
The nurse smiled slightly. "Miss Chi woke up this morning..." [[18780 陌生女1 happy]]
Before she could finish the sentence, Su Tao was already sprinting towards the elevator. [[18781 旁白 happy]]
Her cheeks turned red from the rush of emotions. [[18782 旁白 happy]]
But what she couldn't hide was the explosion of joy from a thousand thoughts converging at once. [[18783 旁白 happy]]
She clenched her fists tightly, shook them excitedly, and then slammed the elevator's 'up' button. [[18784 旁白 happy]]
Xiaocheng, she's finally awake! [[18785 苏桃 happy]]
