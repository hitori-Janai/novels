Chapter 177: No Escape (Thank you all for your encouragement and support) [[15412 旁白 neutral]]
"I... misunderstood Xiaocheng?" [[15413 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's eyes widened as she stared intently at the notice board, feeling her heart clench. [[15414 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng, standing beside her, added bluntly, "Please don't put it so lightly. You never trusted your Xiaocheng at all, did you?" [[15415 程程 angry]]
Cheng Cheng turned and stood in front of Su Tao, looking directly at her. [[15416 旁白 neutral]]
"Even though Chi Xiaocheng is dead, you've blamed yourself and talked about your regrets. I don't know the details, but when you chatted with me, you also felt that much of it was your fault, right?" [[15417 程程 angry]]
"If that's the case, why are you still unwilling to face that mistake?" [[15418 程程 angry]]
Su Tao looked up at Cheng Cheng. "I didn't!" [[15419 苏桃 angry]]
"Then what have you done in the past half a month?" [[15420 程程 angry]]
Cheng Cheng showed no intention of comforting her, instead questioning her, "You didn't kill that person named Ye Liang, did you? You didn't avenge Chi Xiaocheng, you didn't explain to her brother or parents, and you didn't dare to tell her parents that Chi Xiaocheng was dead, right?" [[15421 程程 angry]]
"You've stayed in Chi Xiaocheng's house for half a month without leaving, thinking that crying a few times is a sign of remorse and redemption." [[15422 程程 angry]]
"Just because she loved you, you could enjoy her love without any fear and give nothing in return!" [[15423 程程 angry]]
Su Tao took a step back, feeling like this friend lecturing her was a stranger. [[15424 旁白 neutral]]
Her lips trembled. "I wasn't just enjoying it without a care! I was also trying to figure out how to cure Xiaocheng's yandere tendencies, okay? Don't say I did nothing!" [[15425 苏桃 angry]]
"But wasn't it for your own sake?" [[15426 程程 angry]]
Cheng Cheng's short sentence made Su Tao's trembling hands suddenly go stiff. [[15427 旁白 neutral]]
"Have you ever thought about what Chi Xiaocheng wanted?" [[15428 程程 angry]]
"Have you ever done anything for her?" [[15429 程程 angry]]
"You pretended to like her, lied to her, and coaxed her. Don't say curing her yandere tendencies was for her own good. Weren't you just doing it so you could have a 'better' Xiaocheng for yourself?" [[15430 程程 angry]]
"Even after Chi Xiaocheng died!" [[15431 程程 angry]]
Cheng Cheng's voice suddenly rose. "Chi Song and Brother Long are being hunted by the Ye family because Chi Song killed Ye Liang for you, drawing their fire away from you!" [[15432 程程 angry]]
"Dongfang Yang is still dealing with the matters left behind after Chi Xiaocheng's death!" [[15433 程程 angry]]
"Si Chen is investigating Xiao Ming and Lin Fangya, and he also sent people to her hometown to take care of Chi Xiaocheng's parents. He's so busy he's about to lose his mind." [[15434 程程 angry]]
"And you? Not only did you do nothing, you weren't even willing to go to the hospital to see Chi Xiaocheng a couple more times!" [[15435 程程 angry]]
"What, just because Chi Xiaocheng liked you, loved you, you could do whatever you want?" [[15436 程程 angry]]
"And even blame the dead Chi Xiaocheng, saying things like, 'Ah, it was actually all Xiaocheng's fault, if she wasn't a yandere this wouldn't have happened'?" [[15437 程程 angry]]
One sentence after another, each like a sharp knife stabbing into Su Tao's heart. [[15438 旁白 neutral]]
Her shoulders trembled, and her fists clenched slightly. [[15439 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng glanced at her and sneered, "What, are you angry?" [[15440 程程 angry]]
"I'm not!" Su Tao yelled at Cheng Cheng. "I never blamed Xiaocheng! And treating her yandere tendencies wasn't for myself! Cheng Cheng, you don't understand yandere, and you've never been loved by one." [[15441 苏桃 angry]]
"You have no idea..." [[15442 苏桃 angry]]
*Slap—!* [[15443 旁白 neutral]]
Halfway through Su Tao's sentence, Cheng Cheng raised a hand and slapped her hard across the face. [[15444 旁白 neutral]]
The crisp sound echoed through the school path, startling a few other students passing by. [[15445 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng's slap wasn't very forceful; for Su Tao, it didn't even hurt. [[15446 旁白 neutral]]
Her friend's disappointed voice sounded in her ear again, "Even now, you're still saying these things." [[15447 程程 sad]]
"When Chi Xiaocheng was alive, you treated her love like a game." [[15448 程程 sad]]
"Now that Chi Xiaocheng is dead, you feel regret. You think you should have accepted her confession so she wouldn't have died. Then she could have continued to live, and you could have enjoyed her love as before, without ever thinking about what you would give in return." [[15449 程程 sad]]
"From beginning to end, you've believed that since Chi Xiaocheng loved you, she belonged to you. So even after she died, you never understood how dazzling and precious her sacrifice was." [[15450 程程 sad]]
"That's why you don't know how to cherish it." [[15451 程程 sad]]
"After all, even if she's dead, she'll only love you and no one else, right?" [[15452 程程 sad]]
Cheng Cheng bent down and picked up the things Su Tao had dropped on the ground. [[15453 旁白 neutral]]
She pushed them into her arms. "You can't wake up someone who is pretending to be asleep." [[15454 程程 sad]]
Has no one tried to wake you? [[15455 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, Dr. Cheng, the other two psychologists, even Chen Qian and the sleepy Xiao Wei, they all tried to wake you up, right? [[15456 旁白 neutral]]
But why do you keep sleeping? [[15457 旁白 neutral]]
Are you afraid to face it, or do you just want to stay lost in that dream? [[15458 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng took out her phone, glanced at the time, and said flatly, "If you don't care, there are others who do." [[15459 程程 sad]]
"I'm so disappointed in you, Taotao." [[15460 池小橙 sad]]
The familiar, brief voice made Su Tao look up suddenly, but in her line of sight, Cheng Cheng was already walking away. [[15461 旁白 neutral]]
"Why was that... Xiaocheng's voice?" [[15462 苏桃 sad]]
That last sentence was a huge blow to Su Tao, piercing through her fragile shell and stabbing into her heart. [[15463 旁白 neutral]]
In her shock, she didn't even stop to think about how Cheng Cheng, who was just an online friend, could know so many things. [[15464 旁白 neutral]]
She just stood there, motionless, hugging the large pile of things. [[15465 旁白 neutral]]
Looking back, was there anything Cheng Cheng said that was wrong? [[15466 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Xiaocheng's methods were extreme, she just wanted to keep her by her side. [[15467 旁白 neutral]]
Going after Sister Long and her advisor was only because her Taotao was being bullied. It was for her. [[15468 旁白 neutral]]
And in the end, she would rather die herself to block that bullet for her. [[15469 旁白 neutral]]
"And what was the reward for such a sacrifice?" [[15470 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao murmured, as if asking herself, or as if repeating Cheng Cheng's question. [[15471 旁白 neutral]]
In her vision, a small figure slowly walked out from behind a tree. [[15472 旁白 neutral]]
The girl who appeared swayed as if she had no strength, biting her lower lip tightly. [[15473 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's pupils constricted again, and as she took two steps back, she stumbled and fell to the ground. [[15474 旁白 neutral]]
The person who had come was Fang Ning! [[15475 旁白 neutral]]
What Cheng Cheng had just said suddenly flashed through her mind. [[15476 旁白 neutral]]
—If you don't care about Chi Xiaocheng, there are others who do. [[15477 旁白 neutral]]
And wasn't the person before her exactly that kind of person? [[15478 旁白 neutral]]
From her last chat with Fang Ning, Su Tao could already feel that this child truly saw Chi Xiaocheng as her one and only. [[15479 旁白 neutral]]
That's why when she asked where Xiaocheng had gone, Su Tao chose to hide the truth. [[15480 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't want the news to destroy this girl. [[15481 旁白 neutral]]
But now... [[15482 旁白 neutral]]
The lie had been exposed. [[15483 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know when Fang Ning had started listening, or how long she had been here. [[15484 旁白 neutral]]
Fear and avoidance began to intertwine in her heart. [[15485 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if a voice inside her was constantly screaming, telling this little girl not to come any closer. [[15486 旁白 neutral]]
But every step Fang Ning took seemed to say that this was the consequence of her own actions. [[15487 旁白 neutral]]
The empty-eyed Fang Ning slowly walked up to Su Tao and spoke with a numb expression. [[15488 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Su Tao, Sister Xiaocheng... is she already dead?" [[15489 方柠 sad]]
PS: I'm finally out of the "small dark room." No more orange juice, no crossing the line with cuddles, not even kissing is allowed. My head has been a mess these past few days, and my condition is terrible. I can feel that the last few chapters have been dragging. [[15490 旁白 neutral]]
The review was revised three or four times, and then my traffic was restricted. The several thousand yuan for full attendance and the Haoyue bonus that I worked so hard to earn last month were also canceled because the book entered the "small dark room." At one point, I even thought about just dropping the book. [[15491 旁白 sad]]
But seeing everyone's encouragement, I thought I should continue writing. Cheng and Tao haven't reached the end yet, and they will definitely reach the end. I will adjust my state and bring you better content. [[15492 旁白 happy]]
Thank you for your encouragement and support. After entering the "small dark room," I had zero earnings. I'll still be restricted after coming out, so please help me promote the book. Finally, I'll shamelessly ask for a reward. Love you all ❤ [[15493 旁白 happy]]
