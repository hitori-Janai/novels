Chapter 156: The Flap of a Butterfly's Wings Creates a World-Changing Tornado [[13735 旁白 neutral]]
"What... did you say?!" [[13736 池松 angry]]
Chi Song's eyes turned red as he suppressed his anger, and his voice grew hoarse. [[13737 旁白 neutral]]
It was unclear whether he was angry about the news or at Si Chen himself. [[13738 旁白 neutral]]
However, Si Chen's voice showed no fear. "I said, Chi Xiaocheng is dead." [[13739 司辰 neutral]]
"Bang—!" [[13740 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as he finished speaking, Chi Song, who heard him clearly, squeezed his hand with immense force, crushing the phone he was holding! [[13741 旁白 neutral]]
Shards of the screen and internal glass dug into his palm, but Chi Song didn't loosen his grip at all. [[13742 旁白 neutral]]
He turned around and called to Liang Hei and his other men, "Get in the car, we're going back!" [[13743 池松 angry]]
Liang Hei, holding a well-dressed bodyguard in a suit with one hand, asked in surprise, "Boss, why are we going back now? What about these people from the Ye family?" [[13744 梁黑 neutral]]
Chi Song turned, frowning, and asked in a low voice, "Did you find out what they were doing?" [[13745 池松 angry]]
"We did. The new batch of 'bingtang' circulating in Litchi City was indeed their doing. That Ye Liang is crazy for money!" [[13746 梁黑 angry]]
"In that case, throw all of them into the river, then tell the brothers to return immediately. It's urgent!" [[13747 池松 angry]]
Whether Si Chen's news was true or false, even if it was a "boy who cried wolf" story, he had to return to Jiuzhou City! [[13748 旁白 neutral]]
With one hand on the steering wheel, Chi Song drifted on the icy road and quickly returned to his gang's headquarters. [[13749 旁白 neutral]]
Long Ge seemed to have received some news and was already waiting. "You're back? Someone named Si Chen called me and told you not to be so reckless." [[13750 龙哥 neutral]]
Chi Song was stunned for a moment, and his expression softened. "Sorry." [[13751 池松 neutral]]
Long Ge handed the phone to Chi Song. "You talk to him." [[13752 龙哥 neutral]]
When he answered the call, Si Chen's voice was still calm and rational. "Chi Song, I know you're in a hurry, but don't be. If you let anger cloud your judgment, you won't even get a chance for revenge." [[13753 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Song subconsciously tightened his grip on Long Ge's phone. [[13754 旁白 neutral]]
But he still let out a long breath. [[13755 旁白 neutral]]
As a villain who survived for 200 chapters in the original novel, he wasn't the type of brainless character who would lose his mind to reckless passion. [[13756 旁白 neutral]]
Suppressing his emotions, Chi Song said to Si Chen, "Please explain the details and the current situation." [[13757 池松 neutral]]
Si Chen said, "This morning, a sniper fired at Su Tao. Chi Xiaocheng saved her but was shot. She's in the operating room now, and we just heard that the doctors have done all they can." [[13758 司辰 sad]]
"Su Tao fainted at the hospital, and her condition is unknown. The sniper was hit by a car and died while escaping, but I followed the clues and found the mastermind." [[13759 司辰 neutral]]
"Who was it!" Chi Song's voice suddenly grew louder, causing Long Ge to glance over. [[13760 池松 angry]]
Si Chen calmly uttered two words, "Ye Liang." [[13761 司辰 neutral]]
Ye Liang again! [[13762 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song's anger continued to rise. [[13763 旁白 neutral]]
The recent chaos in Litchi City and the increase in 'bingtang' were all orchestrated by Ye Liang's faction. [[13764 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen said, "I can't deal with Ye Liang alone. He has too much power in Jiuzhou City. I need you to bring your men back to help me, and to help Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao." [[13765 司辰 neutral]]
"Alright! I'll bring my men back!" [[13766 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song agreed without a second thought, but as soon as he nodded, Long Ge took the phone from him. [[13767 旁白 neutral]]
"Songzi, I told you not to be so hasty. You need to use your head, you know?" [[13768 龙哥 neutral]]
Long Ge took the phone from Si Chen and said coolly, "I've never heard of someone like you being around my little sister. Young Master Si, you want to use our power to take down Ye Liang, right? A classic case of trying to get something for nothing?" [[13769 龙哥 neutral]]
Si Chen's voice faltered for a moment, clearly not expecting someone like this to be with Chi Song. [[13770 旁白 neutral]]
He slowly laughed, "That's right, that's part of my plan. But I'm not lying about avenging Chi Xiaocheng. I have a decent relationship with both Su Tao and the little one." [[13771 司辰 neutral]]
Long Ge said, "We can bring our men back, but whatever territory we take in Jiuzhou City, we split it fifty-fifty." [[13772 龙哥 neutral]]
Si Chen: "No problem. You can have the entire Jiuzhou University area. I'll also handle any issues on the legal side. I want Ye Liang dead!" [[13773 司辰 angry]]
Of course he hated Ye Liang to death. His investment in Chi Xiaocheng was just starting to pay off. [[13774 旁白 neutral]]
He was just waiting for Chi Xiaocheng to win over Su Tao, and then for Su Tao's War God father to return. [[13775 旁白 neutral]]
Then he could sit back in his rocking chair, enjoy the sweet drama of Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng's complicated relationship, and wait for the War God father to carry him to an easy victory. [[13776 旁白 happy]]
He would live a relaxed and happy life of revenge. [[13777 旁白 happy]]
But who could have guessed that Ye Liang would flip the table and send a sniper for a direct kill! [[13778 旁白 angry]]
Now, with Chi Xiaocheng dead, all of Si Chen's investments were ruined. [[13779 旁白 angry]]
The four words 'Never Love Tao' might as well be branded on my back in gold! [[13780 司辰 angry]]
Ye Liang, you deserve to die! [[13781 司辰 angry]]
The call ended quickly after they sorted out the details. [[13782 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song's face was cold. Although he hadn't investigated it himself, he mostly believed Si Chen's words. [[13783 旁白 neutral]]
He definitely had to go back, it's just that... [[13784 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song looked at Long Ge, hesitating. [[13785 旁白 neutral]]
Long Ge smiled lightly and rubbed his shiny, bald head, which he had shaved after a recent knife wound grazed his scalp. "Songzi, I'll go with you." [[13786 龙哥 neutral]]
Chi Song was stunned. "Long Ge, how can you do that? You need to hold down the fort here!" [[13787 池松 neutral]]
"Don't flatter yourself." Long Ge's eyes grew cold. "The Ye family has been causing trouble in Litchi City for months, causing me to lose so many of my brothers." [[13788 龙哥 angry]]
"And now they think they can just run away?" Long Ge slammed his hand on the table. "I have to avenge my brothers. If we're going to do this, let's go big. Let's take the fight straight to their headquarters in Jiuzhou City!" [[13789 龙哥 angry]]
Long Ge reached out and punched Chi Song lightly on the chest. "When the time comes, I'll take care of Ye Liang's men. You just need to find that guy and kill him with your own hands to avenge our little sister!" [[13790 龙哥 angry]]
The last time they spoke on the phone, Chi Xiaocheng had sweetly called him Long Ge. [[13791 旁白 neutral]]
For that single 'Ge', he was determined to help! [[13792 旁白 neutral]]
Long Ge patted Chi Song's shoulder again and walked out of the room. "Notify the brothers, we're about to make a big move!" [[13793 龙哥 happy]]
Chi Song took a deep breath, slowly clenching his fists, his eyes turning terrifyingly cold. "Ye Liang, you were lucky in the snow last time. I definitely won't let you get away this time!" [[13794 池松 angry]]
If Su Tao knew the plot of the original novel, and if Chi Xiaocheng were still conscious, they would realize that it seemed like nothing had changed. [[13795 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had tried her best to interfere with the plot, to change the tragic ending of the original novel and find love for herself. [[13796 旁白 neutral]]
But after all her efforts, the plot was still following the original world's timeline. [[13797 旁白 sad]]
She became enemies with Ye Liang, and then she died. [[13798 旁白 sad]]
Chi Song, with Long Ge's forces, was about to launch a crazy counterattack! [[13799 旁白 neutral]]
And the timing in the original novel was almost identical to now, after New Year's Day and before the Lunar New Year's Eve. [[13800 旁白 neutral]]
But the difference was, this time. [[13801 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone was on her side! [[13802 旁白 happy]]
For a moment, the situation in Jiuzhou City was turbulent. [[13803 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao, who had collapsed from being unable to accept reality and had been lying in a hospital bed for a day and a night, finally began to wake up. [[13804 旁白 neutral]]
