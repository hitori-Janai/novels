Chapter 208: Xiaocheng Isn't Dead! [[18187 旁白 neutral]]
The hospital room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, with only Chu Lingfeng's hurried breathing revealing his inner turmoil. [[18188 旁白 neutral]]
According to the medical records, she was undoubtedly dead. [[18189 旁白 neutral]]
He was a miracle doctor, and observation was a basic skill for him. Even without checking her pulse, he could tell from her appearance that the girl was dead, but something about her death was unusual. [[18190 旁白 neutral]]
That's why the hospital had classified it as suspended animation due to shock. [[18191 旁白 neutral]]
But he was even more certain that he had seen this girl on the night of the birthday banquet. [[18192 旁白 neutral]]
It had nothing to do with how cute Chi Xiaocheng looked at first glance; he would simply never forget that half-severed ear. [[18193 旁白 neutral]]
Especially since that night, many people had shouted "I've seen a ghost!" and he himself had been tormented by illusions. When they checked the security cameras later, all the footage of the little scarecrow was completely black. [[18194 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe there really was a ghost! [[18195 楚凌风 sad]]
Otherwise, the security cameras couldn't have been hacked, right? [[18196 楚凌风 sad]]
Just as Chu Lingfeng was growing more fearful, the "beep, beep, beep" of the heart monitor drew everyone's attention. [[18197 旁白 neutral]]
The straight line began to show slight fluctuations. [[18198 旁白 neutral]]
All three of them froze for a moment. [[18199 旁白 neutral]]
Until Su Tao cried out in a voice trembling with excitement, "Xiaocheng—!" [[18200 苏桃 happy]]
She immediately rushed to Chi Xiaocheng's side, placing her index finger under her delicate nose, and clearly felt a faint breath. [[18201 旁白 neutral]]
In that moment, she felt her own breathing quicken. She turned her head hastily, "Pro... Professor Su, Xiaocheng is breathing! She has a breath! She's alive, she's really alive!" [[18202 苏桃 happy]]
Professor Su snapped back to reality and immediately pulled Su Tao away. "Okay, okay! Don't get so close to her. Both of you, leave the room for now. Damn it, I should have put Miss Chi in a more sterile and quiet place!" [[18203 苏教授 angry]]
"Wait outside the door. I'll go get someone right away!" [[18204 苏教授 neutral]]
The woman, in her 50s, ran out of the room as excited as a child. [[18205 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao didn't know how to feel. She clutched her chest with one hand, gasping for air. [[18206 旁白 neutral]]
She could clearly feel her heart pounding rapidly and violently, so much so that her brain felt momentarily deprived of oxygen from the excitement. [[18207 旁白 happy]]
Xiaocheng is alive! [[18208 苏桃 happy]]
She isn't dead! [[18209 苏桃 happy]]
She really isn't dead! [[18210 苏桃 happy]]
Goosebumps covered her skin, and the hand that had just checked for a breath was still trembling uncontrollably. [[18211 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao turned to Chu Lingfeng, who was standing there completely stunned. "Doctor Chu, let's wait outside for now." [[18212 苏桃 neutral]]
But Chu Lingfeng seemed not to hear her, muttering to himself, "Could... could she be back for me?" [[18213 楚凌风 sad]]
"Doctor Chu?" [[18214 苏桃 neutral]]
Another call from beside him brought Chu Lingfeng back to his senses. [[18215 旁白 neutral]]
He forced a smile. "Sorry, I was distracted. What did you just say?" [[18216 楚凌风 neutral]]
"Let's go outside first." [[18217 苏桃 neutral]]
"Oh, oh, okay." [[18218 楚凌风 neutral]]
Su Tao looked strangely at Chu Lingfeng's pale, frightened expression and couldn't help but wonder. [[18219 旁白 neutral]]
This miracle doctor... is he all talk? [[18220 苏桃 neutral]]
Xiaocheng's situation was a bit unusual, but as a miracle doctor, he must have brought people back from the brink of death many times. Surely he's seen a recovery from suspended animation before? [[18221 苏桃 neutral]]
Xiaocheng isn't a ghost, is there any need to be so scared? [[18222 苏桃 neutral]]
She and Chu Lingfeng walked out of the hospital room and saw Professor Su rushing over with a large group of doctors and nurses, pushing various medical instruments. [[18223 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng watched them go, then sat on a chair and held his head in his hands, while Su Tao began to pray silently nearby. [[18224 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike their joy, Chu Lingfeng was sweating, his hands and feet growing cold with fear. [[18225 旁白 sad]]
That was definitely not a recovery from suspended animation! [[18226 楚凌风 sad]]
Maybe she sensed I was in this room and came looking for me! [[18227 楚凌风 sad]]
But I didn't do anything to you. I don't even know your damn name. [[18228 楚凌风 angry]]
Why are you haunting me, you female ghost! [[18229 楚凌风 angry]]
Chu Lingfeng felt like he was about to break down. If this was really a ghost, he would probably never have a moment of peace again. [[18230 楚凌风 sad]]
He glanced at Su Tao beside him. From their earlier chat, he knew that this "ghost" was actually her sister. [[18231 旁白 neutral]]
If she came for me, could it be... [[18232 楚凌风 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng's eyes narrowed, and a shiver ran through him. [[18233 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be that she likes me! [[18234 楚凌风 happy]]
Hiss— [[18235 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she's a ghost, that little face under the hood was actually quite pretty. [[18236 楚凌风 happy]]
Chu Lingfeng reached up and touched his half-ear, then lightly slapped himself. [[18237 旁白 neutral]]
With that much hostility, how could she possibly like me? If I keep fantasizing, I might lose my life. [[18238 楚凌风 sad]]
Watching the doctors go in and out again, an idea formed in Chu Lingfeng's mind. [[18239 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, Professor Su came out of the room, and a group of doctors pushed Chi Xiaocheng to another room. [[18240 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao asked impatiently, "Professor Su, how is she?!" [[18241 苏桃 happy]]
Professor Su gave a relaxed smile. "It's the best news possible. We've confirmed that there are signs of life in Miss Chi's body. She just can't wake up yet. We did a simple check." [[18242 苏教授 happy]]
"We found that active cells in her body are repairing neurons everywhere. I guess it might take another week or two for her to wake up." [[18243 苏教授 neutral]]
"We're moving her to a better room now. It was my oversight to have her here. Thank goodness nothing went wrong." [[18244 苏教授 neutral]]
Hearing Professor Su's words, a huge weight was finally lifted from Su Tao's heart. [[18245 旁白 happy]]
A bright smile spread across her face. "Thank you, Professor Su! It's so great... that Xiaocheng is okay!" [[18246 苏桃 happy]]
As she spoke, a teardrop suddenly fell to the floor. [[18247 旁白 sad]]
Only then did Su Tao raise a hand to her cheek. [[18248 旁白 neutral]]
"Am I... crying?" [[18249 苏桃 sad]]
When did the tears start falling? [[18250 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't felt it at all. [[18251 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps she was just too happy. [[18252 旁白 happy]]
She wiped away the tears and smiled again. She hadn't felt so happy and relieved in a month. [[18253 旁白 happy]]
Professor Su patted Su Tao's head. "Alright, child, compose yourself first. We'll get Miss Chi settled, and you can come over in a little while." [[18254 苏教授 neutral]]
"Okay!" Su Tao nodded firmly. "Um... can I share this news with others?" [[18255 苏桃 neutral]]
"Go ahead." Professor Su understood how she felt. "But she's just waking up from a serious illness, not coming back from the dead, understand?" [[18256 苏教授 neutral]]
"I understand, Professor Su." [[18257 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao immediately took out her phone, ignoring Chu Lingfeng, who stood by, looking like he wanted to say something. [[18258 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly sent messages to everyone familiar with the situation. [[18259 旁白 neutral]]
First were the people who knew the inside story, like Chi Song, Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, and Cheng Cheng. [[18260 旁白 neutral]]
Then there was Doctor Cheng, whom she hadn't contacted in a long time. Su Tao had previously told him that Chi Xiaocheng was hospitalized with a serious illness. [[18261 旁白 neutral]]
She used the same excuse for others who asked where Xiaocheng was. [[18262 旁白 neutral]]
And Fang Ning. [[18263 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't have the little guy's contact information, so she had to ask Dongfang Yang to pass on the message. [[18264 旁白 neutral]]
And just then, as Su Tao sent out the messages, a new wave of Emotion Points flooded into Chi Xiaocheng, who was no longer a "corpse." [[18265 旁白 neutral]]
A huge wave of Emotion Points flooded in. [[18266 旁白 happy]]
