Chapter 225: Affection Points Reset to Zero (Bonus for 桜苒 ②) [[19440 旁白 neutral]]
She was told not to provoke her for now. [[19441 旁白 sad]]
They said it was for her own good. [[19442 旁白 sad]]
She knew it would be best to see Xiaocheng only after the doctors had time to diagnose, treat, and correct her possibly jumbled memories. [[19443 旁白 sad]]
If she was going to upset her, it was best not to see Xiaocheng at all before then. [[19444 旁白 sad]]
Maybe it would only take a few days? [[19445 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe it would take a few weeks or months? [[19446 旁白 neutral]]
No one could say for sure, but Su Tao didn't want to wait even a few more days. [[19447 旁白 sad]]
I want to see Xiaocheng, I want to see Xiaocheng, I want to see Xiaocheng, I want to see Xiaocheng! [[19448 苏桃 sad]]
I want to clear up yesterday's misunderstanding, and then, just like before, she would affectionately call me Taotao, and we would hug. [[19449 苏桃 sad]]
After sitting on a bench at the hospital entrance for a long time, watching the heavy rain fall endlessly, Su Tao couldn't hold back any longer. She walked into the hospital and pressed the button for the eighth-floor elevator. [[19450 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps yesterday was just an accident, a temporary memory confusion caused by Xiaocheng just waking up? [[19451 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe it was just a joke. [[19452 旁白 neutral]]
Today is a new day. Maybe Xiaocheng has already recovered. [[19453 旁白 happy]]
Arriving at the door of the hospital room, Su Tao once again saw Chi Xiaocheng sitting obediently on the bed, holding a book since she didn't have her phone to play with. [[19454 旁白 neutral]]
Her side profile was peaceful and serious as she read. Her small, thin lips, lightly pressed together, seemed to move with the emotions of the book, and her small hand turned one page, and then another. [[19455 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even notice when Su Tao arrived at the door. [[19456 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, even if Su Tao was standing behind her and focused her attention on her for just a moment, she would quickly turn around and give her a sweet smile. [[19457 旁白 sad]]
Back then, Xiaocheng's eyes were filled with nothing but her Taotao. [[19458 旁白 sad]]
The contrast between then and now worsened Su Tao's mood a little, but she still tried her best to show her best side. [[19459 旁白 sad]]
She knocked on the doorframe, three light taps. [[19460 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up, her eyebrows immediately knitting together. "What are you doing here again? Do you pity me for being in a hospital bed?" [[19461 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao's heart sank. She stepped into the room. "I'm not... I... I came to see how you are. I want... I want to apologize to you, Xiaocheng." [[19462 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng gave Su Tao a deep look, then turned her head away. "Forget it. I don't want to see you right now. Please don't disturb me like this anymore." [[19463 池小橙 angry]]
As she spoke, Chi Xiaocheng rubbed her shoulder with one hand. [[19464 旁白 neutral]]
This small gesture made Su Tao's breath catch for a moment. [[19465 旁白 sad]]
Yesterday, she had found it hard to accept the reality of Xiaocheng's amnesia. [[19466 旁白 sad]]
She had subconsciously grabbed her shoulders and questioned her. [[19467 旁白 neutral]]
And subconsciously, she had used some force. [[19468 旁白 neutral]]
For her currently fragile body, the pain caused by that force was probably not insignificant. [[19469 旁白 neutral]]
Noticing this small detail, Su Tao felt even more guilty. [[19470 旁白 sad]]
She wanted to say something more. [[19471 旁白 sad]]
But when she opened her mouth, no words came out. [[19472 旁白 sad]]
She didn't know what was wrong with Xiaocheng's memory, so even if she apologized, she couldn't address the right issue. [[19473 旁白 neutral]]
But now, Su Tao understood one thing clearly. [[19474 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng really, really hated her now! [[19475 旁白 sad]]
She used to like her so much, and now, completely opposite, she hated her. [[19476 旁白 sad]]
Is this my punishment from heaven? [[19477 苏桃 sad]]
Her past avoidance had earned her this current dislike. [[19478 旁白 sad]]
Dejected, Su Tao lowered her head and returned to the lounge, unable to get Chi Xiaocheng's words out of her mind. [[19479 旁白 sad]]
Meanwhile, Dr. Lin and Dr. Chen had more or less consolidated the information and speculations from both sides, and their expressions were a little grim. [[19480 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Chen called in Dongfang Yang and Si Chen and briefly explained the situation. "Maybe... we should hide this from Miss Su Tao for a bit. I'm not sure if she can accept this result." [[19481 陈医生 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's expression also turned gloomy. "Perhaps we can tell her a lighter version of the situation?" [[19482 东方阳 neutral]]
That was what the two doctors were thinking, to use a little white lie and not make it sound so serious. [[19483 旁白 neutral]]
However, Si Chen had a different idea. He pushed up his glasses. "Just tell her directly. Su Tao survived Chi Xiaocheng's death. If she can't even accept this, then what right does she have to say she cares about Chi Xiaocheng?" [[19484 司辰 neutral]]
"This..." Dr. Chen was at a loss for words. In a way, this news was more painful than her death. [[19485 陈医生 sad]]
Sometimes, death does not mean loss. [[19486 旁白 neutral]]
Soon after, Su Tao was also called into the lounge. Including Professor Su, everyone was present. [[19487 旁白 neutral]]
The young woman looked anxiously at the two doctors, her fists clenched. [[19488 旁白 sad]]
Dr. Chen and Dr. Lin exchanged a look, and Dr. Lin spoke first. "Based on our preliminary judgment, Dr. Chen and I have two points about Miss Chi that are 100% certain." [[19489 林医生 neutral]]
"First, she does have symptoms of emotional blunting. Both her positive and negative emotions have decreased by one level." [[19490 林医生 neutral]]
"To put it simply, if a person's emotional threshold is 100, Miss Chi's is probably around 70. Things that would have made her excited now only make her feel pleased." [[19491 林医生 neutral]]
"Happiness, for her, becomes something 'pretty good' and 'nice,' something to be enjoyed, but she won't be as immersed in it as before." [[19492 林医生 neutral]]
"Similarly, for negative emotions like dislike or hatred, they will become deeper. You could say she has become colder and more indifferent to many things, but she is still within the range of a normal person." [[19493 林医生 neutral]]
Dr. Lin looked at Su Tao. "This also explains why Miss Chi's attitude towards you has dropped so sharply. Emotional blunting is a fairly common symptom, even in ordinary people." [[19494 林医生 neutral]]
"And the second point is memory confusion!" [[19495 林医生 neutral]]
Dr. Lin picked up the report in her hand and distributed printed copies to the others. [[19496 旁白 neutral]]
"As summarized here, Miss Chi has severe memory confusion. This severity doesn't mean all her memories are wrong, but for you, Miss Su Tao, it is very severe!" [[19497 林医生 neutral]]
Su Tao took the report but didn't have a chance to read it. Her head was buzzing, and her sense of unease grew stronger under Dr. Lin's sharp gaze. [[19498 旁白 sad]]
"Dr. Lin, what do you mean by 'very severe for me'?" [[19499 苏桃 sad]]
She asked, her hands clutching the paper report so tightly that the corners quickly creased. [[19500 旁白 sad]]
Dr. Lin took a breath. "Miss Su Tao, please prepare yourself for what I'm about to say. This may not be good news for you." [[19501 林医生 neutral]]
After saying that, she waited a moment to give Su Tao some time to prepare herself mentally. [[19502 旁白 neutral]]
Then she continued, "Miss Chi's memory confusion isn't complex. The core of it is her feelings for you, Miss Su Tao. In common terms, we can understand it with one word—'affection'!" [[19503 林医生 neutral]]
"If Miss Chi's affection for Miss Su Tao was at a full 100 points before..." [[19504 林医生 neutral]]
"Now, after the memory confusion, her affection for Miss Su Tao has likely become 0!" [[19505 林医生 sad]]
