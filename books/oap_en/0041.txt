Chapter 41 The Villainous Brother is a Peach-Orange Shipper? [[3506 旁白 neutral]]
"Boss, the place is ours!" [[3507 小弟 neutral]]
In an underground pub in Lizhi City, a burly henchman wearing a gold chain and black clothes dragged a man in a suit to a one-armed, scarred man. [[3508 旁白 neutral]]
The henchman spat on the floor and threw the man in the suit in front of him, "This guy is quite arrogant. He says he's from the Ye family and can send us flying with a wave of his hand. What a joke." [[3509 小弟 angry]]
The man in the suit, who was a manager of the pub, had half his face swollen. He spoke with a missing front tooth, "Let me go! I'm Young Master Ye Liang's man. You thugs really don't know your place. You dare to provoke the Ye family's young master? If you don't let me go, disaster will strike you tomorrow!" [[3510 负责人 angry]]
The henchman heard this and pointed at the manager, laughing, "What kind of Young Master Ye family? What are you pretending for? Are you writing a novel here?" [[3511 小弟 angry]]
With that, he was about to kick him again. [[3512 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, don't make it too difficult for him." [[3513 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song lit a cigarette, then shook his amputated arm and looked at the manager, "I know Young Master Ye Liang. He's still at the same school as my little sister. But his roots are in Jiuzhou City, right? Lizhi City is as chaotic as Gotham." [[3514 池松 neutral]]
"What, does the famous Young Master Ye family also want to get involved in the gray industry?" [[3515 池松 neutral]]
He exhaled a puff of smoke, and the scar on his left cheek twitched with his facial muscles, making Chi Song look extremely fierce. [[3516 旁白 neutral]]
But hidden beneath his fierce appearance was a helpless sigh. [[3517 旁白 neutral]]
He knew that his little sister liked Ye Liang, which made him extremely worried. [[3518 旁白 neutral]]
He was uneducated, but he also knew that their social classes were vastly different. [[3519 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Ye Liang liked his little sister, the people behind him would probably not agree. [[3520 旁白 neutral]]
Not to mention, from his little sister's perspective, their family background was a mess. [[3521 旁白 neutral]]
Her brother was an uneducated thug who mixed with society, and her parents had farmed for decades without any education. [[3522 旁白 neutral]]
"Alas!" [[3523 旁白 neutral]]
Deep in thought, this big man sighed. [[3524 旁白 neutral]]
The henchman saw this and thought Chi Song was unhappy with the manager. He grabbed the manager and lifted him up, "Boss, should we kill this guy?" [[3525 小弟 neutral]]
The manager's pupils contracted when he heard this! [[3526 旁白 neutral]]
His body trembled uncontrollably. [[3527 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song waved his hand, "Didn't you hear what Brother Long said? Just teach him a lesson, don't kill him. Also..." [[3528 池松 neutral]]
He was about to say something else when his phone in his pocket suddenly rang. [[3529 旁白 neutral]]
The henchman frowned in displeasure, "Which audacious fellow dares to call you, boss, at this time?" [[3530 小弟 angry]]
Chi Song took out his phone and looked at it. [[3531 旁白 neutral]]
It was a WeChat call, and the caller's note was—Little Sister! [[3532 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song was so startled that he almost dropped his phone. [[3533 旁白 neutral]]
"Boss, who is it?" [[3534 小弟 neutral]]
The henchman leaned closer, but Chi Song kicked him away, "Get lost! You're the audacious one, daring to talk about others like that!" [[3535 池松 angry]]
After saying that, he wiped his phone on his clothes and was about to answer. [[3536 旁白 neutral]]
Then he nervously looked down. [[3537 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, he was wearing a tank top, and his bulging muscles, accentuated by tattoos, looked particularly terrifying. [[3538 旁白 neutral]]
"You, lend me your shirt!" [[3539 池松 neutral]]
He pointed at a white shirt on one of the henchmen. [[3540 旁白 neutral]]
He put his phone aside, praying that the caller wouldn't hang up too quickly, and then frantically changed his clothes. [[3541 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng, waiting in the cafe, was dumbfounded. [[3542 旁白 neutral]]
The system's notifications kept ringing in her mind. [[3543 旁白 neutral]]
[Supporting character Chi Song is experiencing nervousness, excitement, worry, and other emotions because of the host.] [[3544 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion points +16...] [[3545 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion points +22...] [[3546 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion points +29...] [[3547 系统 neutral]]
She couldn't help but look at the WeChat note again. [[3548 旁白 neutral]]
Invincible Brother. [[3549 旁白 neutral]]
She originally didn't believe it. [[3550 旁白 neutral]]
Now... [[3551 旁白 neutral]]
I declare, my brother is truly invincible! [[3552 池小橙 happy]]
This was just one call, and it hadn't even connected yet, but the emotion points her brother provided were no less than those from the protagonists! [[3553 旁白 neutral]]
After waiting for a while, and after providing two hundred emotion points, Chi Song finally answered the phone. [[3554 旁白 neutral]]
He was wearing a white shirt, leaning against a wall with a beauty poster, and looked at Chi Xiaocheng from the side, seemingly intentionally concealing his empty arm. [[3555 旁白 neutral]]
A simple smile hung on his face, completely unlike the triad boss he had been moments ago, "Little sister, have you had breakfast? What made you think of calling your brother?" [[3556 池松 happy]]
Having gained a batch of emotion points, Chi Xiaocheng was in a good mood, and a natural smile hung on her lips, "Because I missed you, big brother!" [[3557 池小橙 happy]]
The destructive power of a girl's smile was immense. [[3558 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song was stunned for a moment, then tears almost welled up in his eyes from emotion. [[3559 旁白 neutral]]
Wasn't he working so hard outside for his sister? [[3560 旁白 neutral]]
She had indeed become much more sensible after going to college! [[3561 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song wiped the corner of his eye, revealing a warm smile, "Whenever little sister misses her brother, she can call me anytime." [[3562 池松 happy]]
As he spoke, he noticed the gauze wrapped around Chi Xiaocheng's head, "Little sister, what happened to your forehead? Were you bullied again?" [[3563 池松 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng quickly shook her head, "It's nothing, I just fell earlier and scraped a bit of skin." [[3564 池小橙 neutral]]
"That's good." Chi Song breathed a sigh of relief, then asked with concern, "And your living expenses? Is it enough? I have some money here. I'll transfer two thousand to you later." [[3565 池松 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was about to say no, but then she remembered that she couldn't even afford winter clothes now, so she nodded, "Thank you, big brother." [[3566 池小橙 neutral]]
Then she added, "Brother, give me your address. I'll buy you two clothes." [[3567 池小橙 neutral]]
"Okay!" [[3568 池松 happy]]
Chi Song was touched, and again provided a wave of emotion points. [[3569 旁白 neutral]]
Back and forth, the two chatted for over ten minutes, and Chi Xiaocheng had already gained nearly 500 emotion points. [[3570 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't exploit the system bug, and her brother's emotion points from joy and emotion were gradually reaching their limit. [[3571 旁白 neutral]]
"Speaking of which, little sister, how are things with you and Ye Liang?" [[3572 池松 neutral]]
"Uh..." Chi Xiaocheng didn't expect him to ask this question, so she cautiously said, "Ye Liang and I don't have much to do with each other anymore. Because of some things, it's not very pleasant now." [[3573 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Song's eyes lit up when he heard this, "You don't like Ye Liang anymore?" [[3574 池松 happy]]
"Uh... Brother, do you want me to be with Ye Liang?" [[3575 池小橙 neutral]]
"No, no, of course not." Chi Song sighed, "Actually, I told you before, little sister, that we're not in the same league as those young masters. As your brother, I'm a bit selfish. You're my only little sister. Forget about you dating, I wouldn't even want you to get married in the future." [[3576 池松 sad]]
"Brother thinks Su Tao is quite good." [[3577 池松 neutral]]
"Ah?" [[3578 池小橙 surprised]]
Chi Xiaocheng was dumbfounded, providing a huge amount of emotion points for her brother. [[3579 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song lightly coughed, "Brother doesn't interfere, you're free to date. But, I've watched you grow up, and even though I haven't found a wife yet, I can tell that Su Tao girl is a bit possessive of you. You're so cute, if you work hard, maybe you can..." [[3580 池松 neutral]]
"Of course, brother advocates free love. I'll support whoever you like. Well, brother has to go collect some vegetables, so I won't chat with you anymore." [[3581 池松 neutral]]
"Beep beep beep—" [[3582 旁白 neutral]]
Hanging up the call, Chi Xiaocheng was still a bit dazed. [[3583 旁白 neutral]]
Her brother being a siscon was understandable, after all, she was so cute. The original owner's unpopularity only applied to a few male leads. Before college, the original owner was very well-behaved and cute. [[3584 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't expect her brother to be a yuri fan. [[3585 旁白 neutral]]
"If I remember correctly, his relationship with Su Tao seems pretty good." [[3586 旁白 neutral]]
For a long time when they were young, Su Tao lived with the original owner and shared a room with her. Chi Song was also like a half-brother to Su Tao. [[3587 旁白 neutral]]
She thought for a moment and decided to put some pressure on Su Tao. [[3588 旁白 neutral]]
So she messaged her brother, "Brother, I don't have any objections to Sister Su Tao. If you think it's okay, I can try it. But I don't know if Sister Su Tao likes me. Brother, why don't you sound her out?" [[3589 池小橙 neutral]]
"Alright!" [[3590 池松 happy]]
"Remember to be discreet!" [[3591 池小橙 neutral]]
"Don't worry, even my big brother praises me for being meticulous in my rough work!" [[3592 池松 happy]]
Chi Song assured her. [[3593 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Su Tao, who was still walking with Si Chen, received this message. [[3594 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiao Tao, do you like my sister?" [[3595 池松 neutral]]
