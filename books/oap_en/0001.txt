Thank you. [[3 旁白 neutral]]
The main story begins below. [[4 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, do it. You have no turning back now!] [[5 系统 neutral]]
In the dim basement, a young girl with red eyes and a worn-out face held a sharp knife. With a serious expression, the system's voice kept echoing in her head. [[6 旁白 neutral]]
"Creak," the wooden bed in front of her made a sound. [[7 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lifted one eye, her gaze complicated under her messy bangs. [[8 旁白 neutral]]
A fair-skinned, delicate girl was tied to the wooden bed—her arms and legs spread out in a star shape, wrists and ankles restrained. [[9 旁白 neutral]]
Her fair neck and slender waist were no exception. [[10 旁白 neutral]]
Unable to move, she could only make muffled "mmm, mmm" sounds. [[11 旁白 neutral]]
Tears welled in her eyes as she desperately tried to say something. [[12 旁白 neutral]]
Her soft, long hair was spread out, and combined with her stunningly beautiful face, the girl had an indescribable, hazy charm at this moment. [[13 旁白 neutral]]
Meeting the girl's angry gaze, Chi Xiaocheng guiltily looked away. [[14 旁白 neutral]]
Ten minutes had passed, and she still couldn't believe she had traveled into a novel. [[15 旁白 neutral]]
And she had become a cannon fodder female side character who wouldn't even last a hundred chapters! [[16 旁白 neutral]]
This was a female-oriented novel titled "Cannon Fodder Annihilates, All the Hunks are Mine." [[17 旁白 neutral]]
The plot was just like its title. In the early and middle stages, the female lead, Su Tao, defeated countless side characters and villains. With her gentle nature, she charmed various city tycoons, super soldiers, and handsome gods, gradually reaching the pinnacle of her life. [[18 旁白 neutral]]
And the original owner of this body was the villain who left the deepest impression on all the readers. [[19 旁白 neutral]]
She grew up with Su Tao, so it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call them childhood friends. [[20 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao was just too outstanding, her radiance completely overshadowing the original owner, and countless handsome men fell for her. [[21 旁白 neutral]]
If Su Tao were a "player" and accepted these so-called handsome men, it would have been one thing. [[22 旁白 neutral]]
But she was the "perfect girl" type of female lead who won over everyone, rejecting all the men while saying things like, "Xiaocheng, you are my most precious friend." [[23 旁白 neutral]]
In the original owner's eyes, this was just Su Tao showing off. [[24 旁白 neutral]]
It was mockery! [[25 旁白 neutral]]
And so, she completely turned to the dark side. [[26 旁白 neutral]]
She opposed the female lead at every turn, annoying almost all the male leads and supporting male characters who liked her. [[27 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng played with the small knife in her hand, frowning as she recalled, "If I remember correctly, this cannon fodder locked the female lead in a dark room, cut up her face, stabbed her chest, and after various forms of torture, was discovered by one of the male lead's subordinates." [[28 池小橙 neutral]]
"And then..." [[29 池小橙 neutral]]
The male lead, in a fit of rage, beat the original owner until she was half-dead, then threw her into the sea to drown. [[30 旁白 neutral]]
Not only that, but as a villainous cannon fodder, even her family was not spared after she got into trouble. [[31 旁白 neutral]]
"So, does that mean I'm about to be done for?!" [[32 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes widened as she wailed in her heart. [[33 旁白 neutral]]
Before she was luckily hit by a truck, she too was once a model youth who wore the red scarf! [[34 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone gets to travel through time, so why do I get such a hellish start? [[35 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, the villain system in her mind spoke up again. [[36 旁白 neutral]]
[So don't hesitate, Host. Either way, it's death. Why not see what this female lead tastes like first?] [[37 系统 neutral]]
"According to the plot, the male lead's men are about to arrive. You still have the nerve to tell me to bother with the female lead?" [[38 池小橙 angry]]
[We're villains! We're supposed to do villainous things to gain Emotion Points!] [[39 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng ignored the useless villain system's nonsense. Saving her own life was the most important thing. [[40 旁白 neutral]]
Having been given a new life, Chi Xiaocheng didn't want to accept this fate. [[41 旁白 neutral]]
She had read about rebirth and time travel countless times in novels. [[42 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, there was only one way to save her life! [[43 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's gaze fell on the restrained Su Tao. [[44 旁白 neutral]]
It had to be said, she was indeed the sole female lead of the book. [[45 旁白 neutral]]
Both her looks and her figure were top-tier. [[46 旁白 neutral]]
Too bad she was a girl and didn't have a... thingy. [[47 旁白 neutral]]
But in Su Tao's eyes, Chi Xiaocheng's series of thoughts looked very different. [[48 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes she was pondering, sometimes a smile appeared on her face, looking just like a mad person. [[49 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how much she struggled, the other girl showed no mercy. [[50 旁白 neutral]]
Why did it turn out like this? [[51 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng, weren't we supposed to be the best of friends? [[52 苏桃 sad]]
While she was lost in thought, Chi Xiaocheng had already figured out how to save her own life. [[53 旁白 neutral]]
The only way out of this situation was the female lead! [[54 旁白 neutral]]
The original owner died largely because Su Tao had lost all hope in her, allowing the male leads to kill her. [[55 旁白 neutral]]
As long as she could avoid that, her chances of survival would increase dramatically! [[56 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, holding the knife, slowly walked over to Su Tao's side. [[57 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out and yanked off the gag. [[58 旁白 neutral]]
"Cough, cough... cough, cough, cough!" [[59 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao coughed violently. [[60 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment, she managed to look at Chi Xiaocheng, her pure eyes filled with half despair, half confusion. [[61 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, why?" [[62 苏桃 sad]]
Having been tied up here for half a day without a drop of water, her voice was a bit hoarse. "Why are you doing this to me? I never thought of you as an enemy!" [[63 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved upwards. She leaned over and sat on the edge of the bed. Her enchanting red eyes were particularly striking in the darkness. Her voice trembled with excitement as she said, "Taotao, why do you think it is?" [[64 池小橙 happy]]
Her acting skills soared, and a dangerous aura radiated from her. [[65 旁白 neutral]]
Her small hand gently caressed Su Tao's smooth cheek, making the latter's hair stand on end. [[66 旁白 neutral]]
"Is... is it because of Ye Liang and the others? Xiaocheng, you like them, so you think I stole them from you, right?" [[67 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao gave a bitter smile, her eyes filled with an indescribable sadness. "Xiaocheng, I told you long ago, we grew up together. You are the most important person to me!" [[68 苏桃 sad]]
A glimmer of hope appeared in her eyes, and her tone softened in an instant. "Hey, Xiaocheng, let me go, okay? I won't blame you. We can still be best friends." [[69 苏桃 neutral]]
"Then why are you so close to them?" [[70 池小橙 angry]]
"Huh?" [[71 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't understand what Chi Xiaocheng meant. [[72 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng suddenly moved closer, their faces now inches apart. [[73 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao could feel Chi Xiaocheng's warm breath on her cheek, and strands of her light brown hair falling down. [[74 旁白 neutral]]
Whether from nervousness or fear, Su Tao's heart was beating very fast. [[75 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng asked, word by word, "Since you think I'm the most important person to you, why do you still get so close to Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang?" [[76 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao opened her mouth but was at a loss for words. [[77 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled and reached out to pinch Su Tao's cheek. "Taotao, you have no idea what I want." [[78 池小橙 neutral]]
"You think I like Ye Liang and Si Chen, so that's why I'm jealous of you, targeting you, messing up your relationships with them, right?" [[79 池小橙 angry]]
With her cheek pinched, Su Tao still managed to ask, "Isn't that it?" [[80 苏桃 sad]]
As best friends, she thought she knew Chi Xiaocheng very well. [[81 旁白 neutral]]
Didn't their friendship fall apart because the boys she liked didn't like her back and pursued Su Tao instead? [[82 旁白 neutral]]
Including today's kidnapping. [[83 旁白 neutral]]
Because this afternoon, Su Tao was forced to accept Ye Liang's invitation to a dinner party. [[84 旁白 neutral]]
She was his date. [[85 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng was left out, ignored, and even mocked by Ye Liang. [[86 旁白 neutral]]
Jealousy turned into hatred. [[87 旁白 neutral]]
So she kidnapped her before the dinner party. [[88 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't that Su Tao was narcissistic; in her eyes, this was what really happened. [[89 旁白 neutral]]
And the original owner did indeed kidnap her for this reason. [[90 旁白 neutral]]
She hated Su Tao to the core. [[91 旁白 neutral]]
However, the words from Chi Xiaocheng, whose soul had been completely replaced, left Su Tao utterly shocked. [[92 旁白 neutral]]
The seemingly unstable red-eyed girl burst into a wild laugh. "Taotao, I have never liked Ye Liang or Dongfang Yang." [[93 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng brought her lips close to Su Tao's ear and gently exhaled, "Taotao, the person I like most... is you!" [[94 池小橙 happy]]
After saying that, she stuck out her small, pink tongue and licked her earlobe. [[95 旁白 neutral]]
She continued in a low voice, "Taotao, did you know?" [[96 池小橙 happy]]
"I love you! I love you! I love you!" [[97 池小橙 happy]]
"I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!" [[98 池小橙 angry]]
"Since I'm the most important person to you, why do you still have to be around Ye Liang and the others?" [[99 池小橙 angry]]
"Isn't having me enough!" [[100 池小橙 angry]]
