Chapter 175: If Liking is Uncertain, How Can We Talk of Love? [[15262 旁白 neutral]]
Sister Long was basically a tyrant at the supermarket. [[15263 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't just Su Tao; other employees also had their complaints. She often forced them to work overtime and would cut their pay for any small mistake. Her personality was as severe as her face, extremely harsh. [[15264 旁白 neutral]]
The employees said plenty of bad things about her in private, but no one ever dared to confront her openly. [[15265 旁白 neutral]]
Li Ran was known for having the best temper among them. [[15266 旁白 neutral]]
Even when she spoke ill of Sister Long, she was usually subtle. So why would she bluntly say she deserved it? [[15267 苏桃 neutral]]
Sister Long was usually a bit much, but it wasn't *that* bad, was it? [[15268 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly asked for more details. [[15269 旁白 neutral]]
Li Ran said with a displeased look, "Just like you, Taozi, I thought that woman was just a bit mean at worst. But then the police came to investigate, and guess what happened?" [[15270 黎染 angry]]
Beside them, Chengcheng blinked curiously and chimed in, "What happened?" [[15271 程程 neutral]]
Li Ran said, "That woman docking our pay and making things difficult for us was one thing, but she even sold our personal information!" [[15272 黎染 angry]]
"Remember when we first started at the supermarket? We all signed contracts. That Long Mian not only tampered with the contracts, but she also took all the personal information we filled out and sold it online!" [[15273 黎染 angry]]
"We were lucky. My dad is a director at the school and manages this street. And Taozi, you have Dongfang Yang and Si Chen looking out for you, so Long Mian wouldn't dare to do anything to us." [[15274 黎染 neutral]]
"I don't know how Long Mian did it, but she used Yunyun and the others' information to take out loans for hundreds of thousands. It was only discovered during the investigation. The debt collectors had already tracked down their families and were threatening them!" [[15275 黎染 angry]]
Li Ran shuddered with fear just thinking about it, her hand unconsciously tightening on her suitcase handle. "That scum might as well have been stabbed to death!" [[15276 黎染 angry]]
After saying that, she covered her mouth and gave an awkward laugh. "Sorry, I spoke without thinking. If she died, Xiaochengzi would be arrested." [[15277 黎染 sad]]
Arrested... [[15278 苏桃 sad]]
But Xiaocheng is already gone! [[15279 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao pressed her lips together. Her mood, which had been decent after chatting with Chengcheng, suddenly grew heavy. [[15280 旁白 sad]]
She knew Yunyun, a very timid girl who couldn't even make eye contact when she spoke. [[15281 旁白 neutral]]
She was also the girl who had called her last time to say that Xiaocheng was causing trouble at the store. [[15282 旁白 neutral]]
So when Xiaocheng went to find Sister Long, did she already know about all this? [[15283 苏桃 neutral]]
No, that was just her yandere side. Maybe it was just a coincidence. In any case, she hurt my advisor on the same day too! [[15284 苏桃 sad]]
Seeing that Su Tao looked a bit off, Li Ran asked with concern, "Taozi, are you okay?" [[15285 黎染 neutral]]
"Huh?" Su Tao quickly snapped back to reality and forced a smile. "I was just spacing out. I'm fine. So, how are Yunyun and the others now? What about the loans?" [[15286 苏桃 neutral]]
"Long Mian and her uncle were dealt with. A lot of stolen money was found, just enough to pay back the loans for Yunyun and the others. But the information leak... that's a bit harder to resolve." [[15287 黎染 neutral]]
It wasn't just Yunyun; her and Su Tao's information had also been leaked long ago. [[15288 旁白 neutral]]
Although there are no secrets on the internet these days and data leaks are common, being sold like that was still extremely upsetting. [[15289 旁白 neutral]]
Li Ran cursed angrily a few more times before changing the subject. "By the way, Taozi, what happened to Xiaochengzi? Even though she hurt someone, she also exposed that Long Mian's crimes. She should be okay, right?" [[15290 黎染 neutral]]
At the mention of Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao's body stiffened again. [[15291 旁白 neutral]]
No one noticed that Chengcheng, standing to the side, had a slight smile on her face, watching Su Tao's pained and heavy expression as if enjoying a show. [[15292 旁白 happy]]
She stepped forward and said with a smile, trying to smooth things over, "It's fine, of course Xiaocheng is fine. She has Dongfang Yang looking out for her." [[15293 程程 happy]]
Li Ran asked again, "Then where is she?" [[15294 黎染 neutral]]
This time, Chengcheng didn't answer for Su Tao but gently bumped her arm with her shoulder. [[15295 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao forced a smile. "Xiaocheng... she's sick and in the hospital." [[15296 苏桃 sad]]
"I see. As long as she's okay." [[15297 黎染 neutral]]
Li Ran noticed that Su Tao looked unwell and tactfully didn't press the issue. She glanced at her watch and her face filled with alarm. [[15298 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahhh, I've been talking for too long, I'm going to miss my train! I have to go now. See you next semester, Taozi, bye-bye!" [[15299 黎染 happy]]
She grabbed her suitcase and started running. [[15300 旁白 neutral]]
Even as Su Tao waved a gentle goodbye behind her, she didn't look back. [[15301 旁白 neutral]]
Like a good friend, drifting away because of her mistake. [[15302 旁白 sad]]
Chengcheng clasped her hands behind her back, bent forward slightly, and turned to look at Su Tao's profile. She said with regret, "I remember you told me that after your Xiaocheng became a yandere, she went to the store to cause trouble. It seems now that she didn't do anything wrong." [[15303 程程 sad]]
"If this hadn't happened, you and everyone else would have been kept in the dark, and you wouldn't have even known how you were sold out. As soon as Sister Long resigned and disappeared, you all would have been stuck with huge debts." [[15304 程程 neutral]]
"If Dongfang Yang paid the money back for you, you wouldn't have to worry, but what about the other part-time students?" [[15305 程程 neutral]]
"You complained before, didn't you? That she was interfering with your life, disrupting your peace, and that's why you didn't like her yandere side." [[15306 程程 neutral]]
Chengcheng's words came one after another, leaving the girl unable to lift her head. [[15307 旁白 sad]]
She pressed her lips together, as if in defiance or trying to make excuses for herself. "Xiaocheng just... she just stumbled upon this by accident. She also hurt my advisor, just because of one phone call." [[15308 苏桃 sad]]
Saying this, she suddenly looked up. "Chengcheng, you have no idea what it was like back then. Xiaocheng locked me up, constantly pressuring me, and then just because my advisor called to ask if I had finished my thesis." [[15309 苏桃 angry]]
Chengcheng: "And then?" [[15310 程程 neutral]]
"And then I complained that it was so annoying, and as a result, Xiaocheng went out while I was exhausted and asleep!" [[15311 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao spread her hands. "Even if my advisor was pushing me and giving me pressure, he was doing it for my own good! He guided me on so many things, taught me how to write a paper for an academic journal. He told me so himself." [[15312 苏桃 neutral]]
"He said he saw a lot of potential in me, so he would guide me carefully, but that the process would be a bit tiring." [[15313 苏桃 neutral]]
"I agreed. I knew he was doing it for my own good. To put it simply, my advisor was paving the way for me!" [[15314 苏桃 neutral]]
She was getting agitated, not because she wanted to blame Chi Xiaocheng. [[15315 旁白 neutral]]
She just wanted to use this to lessen the guilt and burden she felt after Chi Xiaocheng's death. [[15316 旁白 sad]]
—Xiaocheng's yandere side would ruin her life. [[15317 苏桃 sad]]
It was perfectly reasonable for her to be scared back then, wasn't it? [[15318 苏桃 sad]]
Anyone in her position would have been scared, right? [[15319 苏桃 sad]]
All that talk online about a yandere's love being unique is just from people who haven't experienced it! [[15320 苏桃 angry]]
They have no idea how terrifying the pressure is. [[15321 苏桃 angry]]
She just... she just wanted to prove that she wasn't in the wrong. [[15322 苏桃 sad]]
This was a subconscious defense mechanism after losing her sense of proportion. [[15323 旁白 neutral]]
Avoiding responsibility is also a common trait for most people. [[15324 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng sighed from the side, a hint of disappointment in her eyes. "But, no matter the outcome, your Xiaocheng did it for you, didn't she?" [[15325 程程 sad]]
"It was just her extremism that you couldn't accept." [[15326 程程 sad]]
"I..." [[15327 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao started to speak but stopped, ultimately not refuting Chengcheng's words. [[15328 旁白 sad]]
Chengcheng looked down at her phone. "There's still some time. Do you want to go see your advisor?" [[15329 程程 neutral]]
