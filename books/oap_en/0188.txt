Chapter 188: The Thing She Feared Most Was Her Gentleness [[16397 旁白 neutral]]
"Is the dream ending?" [[16398 池小橙 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, what are you talking about!" Su Tao reached out anxiously, trying to grab Chi Xiaocheng tightly, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't touch the girl at all. [[16399 苏桃 sad]]
The surrounding scenery started to crack like breaking glass. [[16400 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng still stood in front of her, with a faint smile. [[16401 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the unnatural scene, Su Tao stopped lunging forward. She lowered her head, her body slightly hunched, her teary eyes hidden beneath her hair. [[16402 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao understood that this wasn't reality, but a dream. [[16403 旁白 neutral]]
She just didn't want to think about it, deceiving herself and even the dream world so she could stay here forever. [[16404 旁白 sad]]
It was spring here. [[16405 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike the cold and lonely winter of reality. [[16406 旁白 sad]]
Every time she went out and saw the white snow, Su Tao would be reminded of the pure white carpet by her bed at home. [[16407 旁白 sad]]
Over half a month ago, that pure white carpet was stained bright red with the girl's blood. [[16408 旁白 sad]]
Here, there was the lovely Xiaocheng, the person she always longed for, no matter her mood. [[16409 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao wished this was reality instead. [[16410 旁白 sad]]
The painful other side, that was the dream, right? [[16411 旁白 sad]]
Tears fell uncontrollably from her cheeks to the floor of the carriage again. [[16412 旁白 sad]]
"This won't do." Chi Xiaocheng's helpless voice carried a hint of fondness as she walked to Su Tao's side, wanting to hold her shoulders and hug her. [[16413 池小橙 neutral]]
But her hands ended up passing right through Su Tao's body. [[16414 旁白 neutral]]
The girl looked up in shock and met Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[16415 旁白 neutral]]
Those red pupils had scared her countless times in the night. [[16416 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, Su Tao could only see gentleness in those beautiful eyes. [[16417 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took another step back and looked at the girl tenderly, "It seems Taotao has forgotten our final promise." [[16418 池小橙 neutral]]
"Promise?" [[16419 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao stood stunned, unable to remember any final promise she had made with Chi Xiaocheng. [[16420 旁白 neutral]]
All she could remember was the sight of her lying in a pool of blood. [[16421 旁白 sad]]
At that time, she seemed to be saying something... [[16422 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly gasped, her pupils shrinking for a moment. [[16423 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng noticed the change and smiled softly, "It looks like Taotao remembers. So, what has Taotao been doing since I left?" [[16424 池小橙 neutral]]
"I..." [[16425 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao lowered her eyes, "I haven't done anything." [[16426 苏桃 sad]]
The beautiful memories of the dream had filled her, but it was just a dream after all. [[16427 旁白 sad]]
As the dream was about to end, the pain of reality flooded back into her mind, pushing the memories away. [[16428 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao hung her head even lower, not daring to meet Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[16429 旁白 sad]]
"Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, Brother Chi Song, and many others who came from far away to help me, they are all doing something for you, Xiaocheng." [[16430 苏桃 sad]]
"But I'm still running away, unable to face the reality that you... that you're dead, just wasting my days at home without even going out..." [[16431 苏桃 sad]]
Even the revenge was carried out by Brother Chi Song. [[16432 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, a person like you! [[16433 旁白 angry]]
How can someone like me face Xiaocheng! [[16434 旁白 sad]]
What right do I have! [[16435 旁白 angry]]
To enjoy all the wonderful things in this dream! [[16436 旁白 angry]]
Seeing Xiaocheng all this time wasn't to enjoy this beauty, but to tell her I'm sorry! [[16437 旁白 sad]]
Large tears finally began to fall uncontrollably. [[16438 旁白 sad]]
"Hey Xiaocheng, please don't be so gentle with me, okay?" [[16439 苏桃 sad]]
"Come on, blame me, curse me!" [[16440 苏桃 sad]]
"It's all my fault, it's all my fault, it's all my fault, it's all my fault, it's all my fault, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have died at all. Saving someone like me wasn't worth it!" [[16441 苏桃 sad]]
"Please, Xiaocheng... just scold me, okay?" [[16442 苏桃 sad]]
"*Sob...*" [[16443 苏桃 sad]]
She had figured out many things, but she had never forgotten how she had ignored her. [[16444 旁白 sad]]
She hadn't forgotten how she had given her the cold shoulder after their fight during summer vacation. [[16445 旁白 sad]]
She wanted this gentleness, but she was also afraid of it. [[16446 旁白 sad]]
Hit me, scold me, you can vent any emotion on me, just please don't be so gentle with me, okay? [[16447 旁白 sad]]
This kind of gentleness will only make me feel more and more lonely in the real world. [[16448 旁白 sad]]
"Taotao, you always like to overthink things by yourself, taking all the responsibility alone." [[16449 池小橙 neutral]]
"Like I've said before, I never blamed you." [[16450 池小橙 neutral]]
The words in her ear made Su Tao's blurry vision much clearer. [[16451 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked to the window and quietly looked outside, "Did you know, Taotao? I want you to watch me, but since I'm already dead, I don't want you to only focus on me. You can have your own life." [[16452 池小橙 neutral]]
"Study, work, try things you like, work hard to improve yourself. I'm already dead, you know. There's no point in keeping your thoughts on me." [[16453 池小橙 neutral]]
"Do you remember? Our promise." [[16454 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned around, her hair swaying gently, "In the final moments, I wanted you... to forget me." [[16455 池小橙 sad]]
"I was already very happy at that time." [[16456 池小橙 happy]]
"I didn't dare to ask for more." [[16457 池小橙 neutral]]
"I don't want to keep influencing you after I'm gone, and I don't want you to be in pain because of me. You should have a happier and more fulfilling life without me." [[16458 池小橙 neutral]]
As Chi Xiaocheng spoke, a happy smile appeared on her face, "You feel guilty, regretful, and miss me because I'm gone... Although I'm happy about that, but..." [[16459 池小橙 happy]]
"I still hope that Taotao can be happy every day!" [[16460 池小橙 happy]]
The dream was shattering. [[16461 旁白 neutral]]
The glass of the carriage window shattered along with it, accompanied by a somewhat piercing sound. A breeze blew in, lifting Chi Xiaocheng's hair. [[16462 旁白 neutral]]
A faint, happy smile hung on her pretty face, looking so lovely. [[16463 旁白 happy]]
But her body was also gradually becoming transparent. [[16464 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lip, her hands clenching tighter and tighter. [[16465 旁白 sad]]
You say to forget you, and then live a happier life. [[16466 旁白 angry]]
Someone like you... [[16467 旁白 sad]]
You, who have been with me for over ten years... [[16468 旁白 sad]]
You, who told me you loved me in your final moments... [[16469 旁白 sad]]
"How could I ever possibly forget you, Xiaocheng!" [[16470 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao raised her arm and wiped the tears from the corner of her eye, "Xiaocheng, please don't think like that, okay? Aren't you a yandere? Come and possess me, lock me forever in this little dark room called 'dream'!" [[16471 苏桃 sad]]
"I'm willing to be here with you forever!" [[16472 苏桃 sad]]
"Aren't you a yandere? I'm begging you... please don't become so normal..." [[16473 苏桃 sad]]
As she finished speaking, her arm dropped limply again. [[16474 旁白 sad]]
She knew that this could not be changed. [[16475 旁白 sad]]
How can someone who is already dead be brought back to life? [[16476 旁白 sad]]
To still have such a beautiful dream, to be able to talk with Xiaocheng, to tell her how sorry she was, she should have been satisfied. [[16477 旁白 sad]]
But she just wanted to be a little more greedy! [[16478 旁白 sad]]
The girl in front of her was so close, yet so far away. [[16479 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng said softly, "Taotao, can you let go? If you continue like this, you'll only suffer more." [[16480 池小橙 sad]]
"Let go?" Su Tao looked up, her gaze suddenly becoming firm and fierce, "Never!" [[16481 苏桃 angry]]
I will grab your hand, and then... [[16482 旁白 angry]]
Keep you! [[16483 旁白 angry]]
Possess you! [[16484 旁白 angry]]
Keep you by my side forever! [[16485 旁白 angry]]
If... if there is a next life, and if there is such a chance... [[16486 旁白 sad]]
"I will definitely never let go again!" [[16487 旁白 angry]]
