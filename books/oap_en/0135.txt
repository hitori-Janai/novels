Chapter 135: Yandere Xiaocheng, Back Online (Bonus Chapter) [[11864 旁白 neutral]]
A few more days passed. [[11865 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, the first week of December was over. [[11866 旁白 neutral]]
With the help of the System's skills, Chi Xiaocheng recovered quickly and was already able to get out of bed for short walks. [[11867 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's body had already fully recovered. She not only returned to her busy life but could also brave the cold winter to exercise early in the morning. [[11868 旁白 neutral]]
One day, when Su Tao was changing in her hospital room, although she was well-covered, her toned abs still made Chi Xiaocheng gasp in admiration. [[11869 池小橙 happy]]
As expected of the perfect female lead from the book; not just her personality and looks, but her figure was also perfect. [[11870 池小橙 happy]]
Meanwhile, the latest news came from Chen Qian. [[11871 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang asked me to be an informant and drug you and Su Tao. I pretended to agree and made him eat that apple." [[11872 陈倩 neutral]]
"He's recovering poorly now and said he spent a lot of money to hire new people to target you and Su Tao. You need to be careful." [[11873 陈倩 neutral]]
"He also gave me fifty thousand yuan, probably to bribe me. He said he would give me more later, with hundreds of thousands more after the job is done. He's just making empty promises." [[11874 陈倩 neutral]]
"That Ye Liang is so disgusting. He's so narcissistic, saying that if I do a good job, he might give me the chance to have a meal with him. He even 'graciously' allowed me to take care of him for a while." [[11875 陈倩 angry]]
"He even called it my 'reward'! Making me work myself to death taking care of a patient. How dare he call that a reward? He might as well just give me more money." [[11876 陈倩 angry]]
"Luckily, I had an excuse to make him eat the whole apple." [[11877 陈倩 happy]]
"I'll transfer twenty thousand of the fifty thousand to you, Chi Xiaocheng. I also gave ten thousand to Xiaowei. If you need anything else, just let me know. I'll pass you information from Ye Liang's side!" [[11878 陈倩 neutral]]
This was truly seeking fortune in the face of danger! [[11879 旁白 neutral]]
What Chen Qian did was beyond Chi Xiaocheng's expectations. [[11880 旁白 neutral]]
Because she wasn't sure how long the 'faked death' would last, her original plan was to give Chen Qian a so-called fake antidote to win her over and prevent any accidents. [[11881 旁白 neutral]]
She never expected Chen Qian to actually infiltrate the enemy's ranks. [[11882 旁白 happy]]
This minor side character, who only survived for about ten chapters in the original novel, was truly getting a second chance at life. [[11883 旁白 neutral]]
What excited Chi Xiaocheng even more was that Ye Liang had eaten the poisoned apple. [[11884 旁白 happy]]
The bad luck neutralized his good fortune, and he no longer had the protagonist's halo. [[11885 旁白 neutral]]
Whether the world's will would still protect him was uncertain, but if a chance to get rid of Ye Liang arose, there would be no more unexpected obstacles! [[11886 旁白 neutral]]
Having personally experienced the high-speed chase in Su Tao's car, Chi Xiaocheng now understood just how powerful these halos were. [[11887 旁白 neutral]]
A novice driver, a slippery snow-covered road, extremely low visibility at night, reckless pursuers, guns, and even a broken bridge. [[11888 旁白 neutral]]
Despite all the danger, Su Tao escaped with only a small cut on her forehead. [[11889 旁白 neutral]]
That elaborate chase was less stressful than Chi Xiaocheng feeding Su Tao a little orange juice. [[11890 旁白 neutral]]
The only thing that worried her was what Chen Qian said about Ye Liang spending a lot of money to deal with them. [[11891 池小橙 sad]]
I can't rest easy until that guy is dead! [[11892 池小橙 angry]]
But for now, Chi Xiaocheng was enjoying Su Tao's care in the hospital, so she was being as obedient as possible. [[11893 旁白 neutral]]
She would be safe for a while. She was about to be discharged and would be home with Taotao for a long time. [[11894 池小橙 neutral]]
If something were to happen, it would have to be when they go out, right? [[11895 池小橙 neutral]]
As time went by, the day of Chi Xiaocheng's discharge from the hospital soon arrived. [[11896 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su handed a large pile of medicine to Su Tao and instructed, "You must make sure she takes her medicine every day, you hear? The most important thing is her mood. Keep her calm!" [[11897 苏教授 neutral]]
Professor Su's words had a hidden meaning, but Su Tao understood. [[11898 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's mental state had improved, so she absolutely couldn't be provoked like last time. [[11899 旁白 neutral]]
Until she was sure that this obedience wasn't an act, it was best to agree to all of her requests for now. [[11900 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao was indeed prepared for this. [[11901 旁白 neutral]]
She was even ready to face Chi Xiaocheng's yandere side. [[11902 旁白 neutral]]
After instructing Su Tao, Professor Su turned and patted Chi Xiaocheng's head, "And you, little one, you have to eat on time and get enough nutrition, understand?" [[11903 苏教授 neutral]]
"Thank you, Auntie Su. See you next time~" [[11904 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded obediently, waving her small hand at the professor who had taken care of her for over a week. [[11905 旁白 neutral]]
Next time we meet, it might really be after my faked death. [[11906 池小橙 sad]]
Walking home hand in hand, Chi Xiaocheng, who hadn't been outside the hospital, enjoyed the fresh air. [[11907 旁白 happy]]
"Taotao." [[11908 池小橙 neutral]]
She called out to Su Tao. [[11909 旁白 neutral]]
"What is it?" [[11910 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled with innocence and anticipation, "When we get home, when can we play a game together? Taotao has been so busy these days, I don't even know what you've been doing." [[11911 池小橙 happy]]
"I want some time to be alone with Taotao~" [[11912 池小橙 happy]]
Her obedient smile inexplicably sent a chill down Su Tao's spine. [[11913 旁白 neutral]]
Just like last month, Chi Xiaocheng had been a little too obedient these past few days. [[11914 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao almost wished Chi Xiaocheng would throw a little tantrum, which would feel more normal to her. [[11915 旁白 neutral]]
Because hidden beneath this obedience was a terrifying yandere state. [[11916 旁白 neutral]]
But the current Xiaocheng could be reasoned with, so it was different from before. [[11917 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pretended not to know and asked, "So what kind of game does Xiaocheng want to play?" [[11918 苏桃 neutral]]
"The little black room game!" [[11919 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked forward to it foolishly, "I'll keep Taotao at home, and I'll decide everything you eat and drink. You won't be allowed to take a single step out of the house." [[11920 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao keenly caught the key point in her words, "The entire house, or just the room?" [[11921 苏桃 neutral]]
"The whole house, of course." Chi Xiaocheng said lightly, "After all, I can't cook, so I usually have to trouble Taotao for that." [[11922 池小橙 neutral]]
I see. It's not as terrifying as being locked in the room like last time. [[11923 苏桃 neutral]]
It literally just means staying at home. [[11924 苏桃 neutral]]
What's the big deal? It's just not leaving the house for three days and spending that time with Xiaocheng. [[11925 苏桃 neutral]]
That's too easy. [[11926 苏桃 happy]]
In fact, Su Tao herself also enjoyed spending time with such an obedient Chi Xiaocheng. The two days of Saturday and Sunday were a perfect opportunity to observe Chi Xiaocheng's yandere condition. [[11927 旁白 neutral]]
So Su Tao nodded, "Then let's agree first, Xiaocheng needs to tell me the time in advance. I'll finish my work, and then I'll spend quality time with you." [[11928 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay, okay! The day after tomorrow is Saturday. How about we start with three days?" [[11929 池小橙 happy]]
Three days... [[11930 苏桃 neutral]]
One extra day, but that's fine. [[11931 苏桃 neutral]]
For now, I'll just go along with Xiaocheng. [[11932 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled and nodded, "Okay, whatever Xiaocheng says." [[11933 苏桃 happy]]
"I love Taotao the most!" [[11934 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng happily hugged Su Tao, planted a light hickey on her cheek, and skipped ahead cheerfully into the wind. [[11935 旁白 happy]]
Her happiness also brought a smile to Su Tao's face. [[11936 旁白 happy]]
Days like these are truly wonderful. [[11937 旁白 happy]]
Another day passed. [[11938 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng spent several hundred Emotion Points to finally complete the necessary preparations. [[11939 旁白 neutral]]
With Su Tao not around, she no longer needed to use her intermediate acting skills to play the part of a good girl. [[11940 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she modified the room and filled the fridge with three days' worth of food. [[11941 旁白 neutral]]
Then, playing with a familiar fruit knife, she sent a message to Su Tao with an unsettling smile, "Taotao, when are you coming over to play? I'm all ready~" [[11942 池小橙 happy]]
I've never forgotten the pain of betrayal when you abandoned me on the Binjiang Bridge. [[11943 池小橙 angry]]

PS: Recommending a friend's book, also a yuri story. Author: 十万水星 (Hundred Thousand Mercury), Title: "Villainous Magical Girl, Daily Task is to Find Trouble" [[11945 旁白 neutral]]
She becomes a villainous loli magical girl and ruthlessly punishes the righteous magical girls. Anyway... you know what I mean. The quality is guaranteed, it's very good, highly recommended! [[11946 旁白 happy]]
