Chapter 39: You Raised a Yandere and Didn't Know It? [[3315 旁白 neutral]]
After a harsh beating, Liu Guijia was no longer stubborn. [[3316 旁白 neutral]]
She sat on a chair, wiped her face with a tissue, and recounted what happened in Chi Xiaocheng's room with a sense of grievance. [[3317 旁白 neutral]]
She glossed over the part where she bullied Chi Xiaocheng, avoiding the worst details. [[3318 旁白 neutral]]
She got straight to the point, "I wasn't going to do anything to her, I just scared her. Then I said that neither Chi Xiaocheng nor you were any good." [[3319 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
"After that, Chi Xiaocheng seemed to go crazy." [[3320 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
"She kept saying that it was okay to curse her, but not you, and she even ran towards my knife. I said sooner or later... I'd beat you like a dog, and Chi Xiaocheng said that even if you were a dog, you could only be her dog and have nothing to do with me." [[3321 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Then, she snatched my knife." [[3322 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
"After stabbing my thigh, she cut her own forehead and told me to hurry up and do it, saying she was the real victim." [[3323 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
"Finally, she muttered to herself that she wasn't a yandere." [[3324 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
Just thinking about it made Liu Guijia feel a lingering fear. [[3325 旁白 neutral]]
She shrank back and said, "Then you came into the house and started hitting me without saying a word. I'm the real victim in all of this, okay!" [[3326 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Su Tao frowned, "You're not lying to me?" [[3327 苏桃 neutral]]
Hearing this, Liu Guijia's blood pressure shot up. Ignoring the bright red marks on her face, she stood up and yelled, "If I don't say anything, you think I'm stubborn. When I tell you, you don't believe me. If I'm lying, may my whole family die!" [[3328 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Su Tao rubbed her chin and asked, "What was Xiaocheng's state at that time? What was her expression like?" [[3329 苏桃 neutral]]
"Well..." Liu Guijia recalled calmly. "It felt like she became a different person. Her tone was frantic, her face was flushed, and her eyes were a bit like a cat's. In short... it was terrifying!" [[3330 刘桂嘉 sad]]
She wasn't lying about that. [[3331 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao remembered that Chi Xiaocheng had been in a similar state in the basement and on the rooftop. [[3332 旁白 neutral]]
She tentatively called it her "yandere mode." [[3333 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, she was quite normal, but once her bottom line was crossed, she would become morbidly insane. [[3334 旁白 neutral]]
But here was the problem. [[3335 旁白 neutral]]
She had crammed a lot of information about yanderes. [[3336 旁白 neutral]]
Without a doubt, the state Chi Xiaocheng had shown before—self-harm, seeking death—was the typical "sickness" of a yandere. [[3337 旁白 neutral]]
But another major characteristic of a yandere is that they are good at pretending! [[3338 旁白 neutral]]
And Dr. Cheng had said that yanderes usually don't know they are yanderes. [[3339 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng knew she was a yandere. [[3340 旁白 neutral]]
And she even said she wasn't a yandere. [[3341 旁白 neutral]]
Yet, she displayed all sorts of morbid behaviors. [[3342 旁白 neutral]]
So the question was... [[3343 旁白 neutral]]
Is she a yandere or not? [[3344 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao never knew Chi Xiaocheng was capable of such acting. [[3345 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a headache." [[3346 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao rubbed her temples, realizing she couldn't figure it out on her own. [[3347 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing it was getting dark outside, she took out her phone and looked at Liu Guijia. "Transfer the seven thousand you owe Xiaocheng to me now." [[3348 苏桃 neutral]]
Liu Guijia's face stiffened. "I... I don't have any money. I only have three hundred on me." [[3349 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Su Tao cracked her knuckles, making a popping sound, and asked slowly, "If you don't have money, then how do you plan to solve this?" [[3350 苏桃 angry]]
"I... I..." Liu Guijia looked flustered, afraid Su Tao would hit her again. Without thinking, she blurted out, "Can I use my body?" [[3351 刘桂嘉 sad]]
She shrank back. "Your relationship with Chi Xiaocheng must be special, since you were able to train her into that state. If you don't mind, I..." [[3352 刘桂嘉 sad]]
"Stop!" [[3353 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao stood up and backed away with a look of disgust. "Take a look at yourself. Don't disgust me." [[3354 苏桃 angry]]
Comparing the two girls... [[3355 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia was simply a toad. [[3356 旁白 neutral]]
When it came to being cute, Xiaocheng was the best. [[3357 旁白 neutral]]
The image of Chi Xiaocheng's cute face and sweet smile appeared in her mind, and Su Tao felt much more relaxed. [[3358 旁白 happy]]
She took a breath. "One month. If you can't come up with the money, I'll be back. If I find out you're still bullying weaker people, you can expect to spend the rest of your life in jail!" [[3359 苏桃 angry]]
With that, Su Tao prepared to leave. [[3360 旁白 neutral]]
But her sharp eyes noticed a small figure huddled in the corner. [[3361 旁白 neutral]]
She looked as small as Chi Xiaocheng. [[3362 旁白 neutral]]
Her clothes were ragged, and her hair and exposed skin were filthy. [[3363 旁白 neutral]]
She shot a fierce glare at Liu Guijia, walked over to this little follower, and extended her hand. [[3364 旁白 neutral]]
Her smile was like moonlight shining down. "Don't worry, she won't dare to bully you anymore. My name is Su Tao, what's yours?" [[3365 苏桃 happy]]
However, to Su Tao's surprise, the girl in front of her shrank back again. [[3366 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly shook her head and didn't take the outstretched hand. [[3367 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao thought the girl was just scared. [[3368 旁白 neutral]]
But then she heard her weak voice, "Thank you." [[3369 陌生女1 sad]]
Then she shook her head again. [[3370 旁白 neutral]]
This time, it was a clear refusal. [[3371 旁白 neutral]]
She must have been a victim of bullying too, yet she refused her help. [[3372 旁白 neutral]]
A bit strange. [[3373 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao didn't interfere further; she respected everyone's choices. [[3374 旁白 neutral]]
Before leaving, a thought suddenly struck her. She looked back at Liu Guijia. "By the way, why do you think Xiaocheng became like that, like you said, crazy?" [[3375 苏桃 neutral]]
"Huh?" Liu Guijia covered her face and looked at Su Tao as if she were an idiot. "Wasn't it your doing? The dog you raised... no, the person you brought along, you don't know why she became like this?" [[3376 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Getting her answer, Su Tao sighed. [[3377 旁白 sad]]
She walked out the door. [[3378 旁白 neutral]]
The sun had set, and the moon, peeking through the clouds, began to dance with the stars. [[3379 旁白 neutral]]
Winter was approaching, and the days were getting darker faster. [[3380 旁白 neutral]]
And colder. [[3381 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao breathed out a puff of warm air and walked slowly into the dark alley. [[3382 旁白 neutral]]
The next morning, after a night of rest, Chi Xiaocheng woke up holding her head. [[3383 旁白 neutral]]
"System, what are my Emotion Points at?" [[3384 池小橙 neutral]]
This was something she checked every morning when she woke up. [[3385 旁白 neutral]]
By checking the time and amount of Emotion Points provided by the main characters, she could estimate if anything important had happened. [[3386 旁白 neutral]]
[Replying to Host, 754 points.] [[3387 系统 neutral]]
[Yesterday evening, both the female lead Su Tao and the male lead Ye Liang provided a sum of Emotion Points.] [[3388 系统 neutral]]
It wasn't easy for her to get Emotion Points quickly without causing a major scene; usually, it was just three or five points at a time. [[3389 旁白 neutral]]
Now it had suddenly increased by several hundred points? [[3390 旁白 happy]]
"What happened yesterday evening?" [[3391 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao was understandable; she was probably just worried about her, which generated Emotion Points. [[3392 旁白 neutral]]
But as for Ye Liang, she had been in the hospital for a few days and hadn't left home since returning. Hiding away didn't seem to be a solution. [[3393 旁白 sad]]
*Ding-dong~* [[3394 旁白 neutral]]
Her phone chimed. [[3395 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng picked up her phone. It was a message from Chen Qian on WeChat: "Chi Xiaocheng, it's been seven days. You promised me the antidote. I'm starting to get a rash on my face. Hurry up and give me the antidote!" [[3396 陈倩 angry]]
Only then did Chi Xiaocheng remember that she had promised to give Chen Qian a so-called antidote every week. [[3397 旁白 neutral]]
But in reality, the bottled water she had "spiked" was just mineral water. [[3398 旁白 neutral]]
A rash... a hormonal imbalance or an allergy? [[3399 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng typed back, "Don't worry. I asked you to keep an eye on Su Tao. How is that going?" [[3400 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "That girl is so dumb. She believes anything I say. Plus, with what you said about recommending a psychologist to her, she trusts me completely now." [[3401 陈倩 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Good. Keep it up. It would be best if you become her best friend who she tells everything to. By the way, she went back to the dorm last night, right? Do you know what she did in the evening?" [[3402 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "I'm not sure. She seemed pretty tired when she came back. But she talked to Si Chen on the phone for ten minutes before bed. I don't know what they talked about." [[3403 陈倩 neutral]]
"Si Chen?" [[3404 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow. An image of a sinister, glasses-wearing man appeared in her mind. [[3405 旁白 neutral]]
He was also one of the important male leads in the novel, and his character type was one that Chi Xiaocheng found very difficult to deal with! [[3406 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sent a message to Chen Qian, "Meet me at Moonlit Cafe. I'll bring you the antidote." [[3407 池小橙 neutral]]
