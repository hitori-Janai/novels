Chapter 257: Each Other's Only One [[21893 旁白 neutral]]
On the way back to the hospital room, Chi Xiaocheng could sense that Su Tao was unhappy. [[21894 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what that white rose symbolized, it was a gift from her, and now it was lost because of an accident. [[21895 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao care so much about her gift made Chi Xiaocheng feel happy. [[21896 旁白 neutral]]
So, along the way, she actively tried to cheer her up. [[21897 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to make her happy. [[21898 旁白 neutral]]
What was lost was only a flower, while Xiaocheng was still right in front of her. [[21899 旁白 neutral]]
After returning to the hospital, the first thing to do was to check her physical condition, especially after a whole night of shopping and fun. [[21900 旁白 neutral]]
After an examination by Professor Su, it was confirmed that she was just tired and needed more rest. [[21901 旁白 neutral]]
Given her current condition, it would be fine for her to be discharged for New Year's Eve and the Spring Festival in two days. [[21902 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, Chi Xiaocheng could have used potions to speed up her recovery. [[21903 旁白 neutral]]
However, she had no intention of doing so. [[21904 旁白 neutral]]
Her recovery speed was already strangely fast with the help of her skills. [[21905 旁白 neutral]]
If she took a potion and recovered instantly, Professor Su would probably do more than just declare it a miracle. [[21906 旁白 neutral]]
By the time her IV drip was done, it was 11:30 PM. For a patient like Chi Xiaocheng, this was definitely staying up late. After finishing their tasks, the doctors left her to rest. [[21907 旁白 neutral]]
She glanced at her Emotion Points. [[21908 旁白 neutral]]
4153 points! [[21909 旁白 neutral]]
She had been spending a lot lately. Every time she used a temporary acting skill or an emotion-dulling pill, it cost her 500 Emotion Points. [[21910 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't seen Chu Lingfeng, so she had no chance to buy the poisoned apple and find a reason for him to eat it. [[21911 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, although she spent a lot of Emotion Points, her current income was barely enough to cover her expenses. [[21912 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao could no longer provide many Emotion Points from negative emotions like stress, despair, or regret. [[21913 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had almost completely exhausted that source. [[21914 旁白 neutral]]
But since Su Tao woke up, Chi Xiaocheng had given her a lot of emotional support, changing her attitude from dislike to calling her "Sister Su Tao." The Emotion Points gained from that journey from despair to hope had not decreased. [[21915 旁白 neutral]]
There were also a few points from other side characters. [[21916 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng had to spend a large sum of Emotion Points tonight. [[21917 旁白 neutral]]
【Substitute Pillow: 300 Emotion Points】 [[21918 旁白 neutral]]
【Create an identical substitute. The substitute will remain asleep, unable to move, and will have basic vital signs. Duration: 6 hours】 [[21919 旁白 neutral]]
【Temporary Recovery Potion (Advanced): 500 Emotion Points】 [[21920 旁白 neutral]]
【Restores the user's body to the level of a normal adult for a short period. Duration: 5 hours】 [[21921 旁白 neutral]]
【Presence-Concealing Cloak (Single-Use): 666 Emotion Points】 [[21922 旁白 neutral]]
【A dark, hooded cloak that can hide your presence and appearance. As long as the hood is up, no one, including modern cameras and surveillance, can see your face.】 [[21923 旁白 neutral]]
After searching the system store for 10 minutes, Chi Xiaocheng found what she was looking for. [[21924 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, she had a very specific goal in mind. [[21925 旁白 neutral]]
The system saw the items she added to her cart, understood her intentions, and quickly tried to stop her. [[21926 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, you're not buying these things to go out and cause trouble, are you?" [[21927 系统 neutral]]
"Impulsive actions are a bad idea!" [[21928 系统 neutral]]
"Impulsive? System, what are you talking about? I'm perfectly calm." As she spoke, Chi Xiaocheng had already purchased the substitute pillow. [[21929 池小橙 neutral]]
A sleeping person who looked exactly like her appeared on the bed. [[21930 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pinched the "Pillow Xiaocheng's" skin. It felt much worse than her own, but it was warm and she could feel warm breath from its nose. [[21931 旁白 neutral]]
While placing the pillow on the bed and covering it with a blanket, Chi Xiaocheng replied to the system. [[21932 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm just going out to deal with someone who needs to be dealt with. How is that causing trouble?" [[21933 池小橙 neutral]]
"Someone who needs to be dealt with?" [[21934 系统 neutral]]
"That's right." Chi Xiaocheng pulled the IV needle out of her arm and inserted it into the substitute's, saying calmly, "That Lin Fangya, you haven't forgotten what she just did, have you, System?" [[21935 池小橙 angry]]
She answered her own question. [[21936 旁白 neutral]]
"That bitch who insulted my Tao Tao, saying such horrible things. And the sniper she sent last time, if I hadn't blocked that shot, Tao Tao would be dead!" [[21937 池小橙 angry]]
"I can be revived, but what about Tao Tao?" [[21938 池小橙 sad]]
"If she dies, she's gone forever!" [[21939 池小橙 sad]]
"Ye Liang and her were both behind it. Ye Liang is dead now, but she's still alive. How can I rest easy?" [[21940 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng made no effort to hide her feelings. Her cat-like eyes glowed red. [[21941 旁白 neutral]]
The time limit for the acting skill she bought at the banquet had already passed. [[21942 旁白 neutral]]
The emotion-dulling pill wore off even faster. [[21943 旁白 neutral]]
When she was alone, she didn't even need to trigger her intermediate acting skills. [[21944 旁白 neutral]]
At the banquet, Chi Xiaocheng had felt the urge to kill Lin Fangya on the spot. How could she forget that now? [[21945 旁白 neutral]]
The system continued to persuade her. [[21946 旁白 neutral]]
"But Host, Dongfang Yang already said he would take Lin Fangya away. They might be able to get a lot of information about the main character, Xiao Ming, from her." [[21947 系统 neutral]]
"Logically, this woman is definitely more useful alive than dead right now." [[21948 系统 neutral]]
"If you go and deal with her directly, you'll be going against Dongfang Yang and Si Chen's plans." [[21949 系统 neutral]]
"Besides, do you remember what I told you?" [[21950 系统 neutral]]
"After your fake death, your character's importance in this world was temporarily reset. You've faded from the World's Will's attention, so you won't be targeted like before." [[21951 系统 neutral]]
"However, Ye Liang is dead. As someone close to him, Lin Fangya was originally a minor character who would die in a few chapters, but now she has definitely gained some of his importance." [[21952 系统 neutral]]
"In other words, she has been upgraded to a minor side character with some significance." [[21953 系统 neutral]]
"If you make a move against her, there's a good chance the World's Will will start paying attention to you again!" [[21954 系统 neutral]]
Of course, Chi Xiaocheng understood what the system was saying. [[21955 旁白 neutral]]
The purpose of faking her death was to raise Su Tao's affection for her and to avoid the World's Will. [[21956 旁白 neutral]]
If she acted impulsively, she would be targeted again. [[21957 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew that leaving everything to Dongfang Yang and Si Chen was the best choice right now. [[21958 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[21959 旁白 neutral]]
"I want to get revenge for Tao Tao!" [[21960 池小橙 angry]]
She knew this, but she still intended to do it. [[21961 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't let it go. She was furious about the insult and the assassination attempt. She herself would never dare to scold her Tao Tao, so who else would dare to insult her! [[21962 旁白 neutral]]
Crazy, extreme, and reckless. [[21963 旁白 neutral]]
This was a yandere. [[21964 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was a relatively rational type. She could still think clearly in her normal state, otherwise she wouldn't have spent so many Emotion Points on these preparations. [[21965 旁白 neutral]]
If she could, she would even want to kill the "miracle doctor," Chu Lingfeng. [[21966 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to eliminate anyone who could possibly threaten Tao Tao. [[21967 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng was, after all, someone who might cause trouble in the future. [[21968 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya was different. [[21969 旁白 neutral]]
She almost killed Tao Tao! [[21970 池小橙 angry]]
A life for a life! [[21971 池小橙 angry]]
"System, don't try to talk me out of it. I'm definitely going out tonight. Even if the World's Will targets me again, I'm still going!" [[21972 池小橙 angry]]
"Sigh." [[21973 系统 sad]]
"Host, why do you have to do this? You're just getting yourself into trouble, and it will only lead to more problems later on." [[21974 系统 sad]]
"You don't understand, System." [[21975 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng bought the presence-concealing cloak and used two ribbons to tie her long hair into two small ponytails in the front. [[21976 旁白 neutral]]
She pulled the cloak over herself. [[21977 旁白 neutral]]
She adjusted the hood on her head, and her fair face was hidden in the shadows, leaving only her vertical pupils glowing red. [[21978 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what, she would get her revenge. [[21979 旁白 neutral]]
This wasn't about being extreme or impulsive. [[21980 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to do this. [[21981 旁白 neutral]]
And she definitely would. [[21982 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao is my only one." [[21983 池小橙 neutral]]
No one can hurt her! [[21984 池小橙 angry]]
