Chapter 87: What You Want, I Will Give You [[7587 旁白 neutral]]
    Ah, what a complicated scene. [[7588 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps it shouldn't be like this. [[7589 旁白 neutral]]
    But there's no other way, I have to try what Doctor Cheng said. [[7590 旁白 neutral]]
    First her small hand, then her cheek, then the corner of her mouth, and then... [[7591 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng's crimson eyes were like a mirror, condensing her entire reflection and sealing it within. [[7592 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao felt very much enjoying it, because such an obedient and compliant Xiaocheng was simply too cute. [[7593 旁白 happy]]
    It wasn't until she stopped for a long time that she looked up at the girl. [[7594 旁白 neutral]]
    She didn't forget her purpose because of the softness, and asked, "Xiaocheng, are you feeling okay?" [[7595 苏桃 neutral]]
    Although she knew it rationally, it still made her shy. [[7596 旁白 neutral]]
    Her yandere self, even in the dark room, had done this kind of thing many times. [[7597 旁白 neutral]]
    But after all, she had caused it herself. [[7598 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao was even a little worried now that she might make Chi Xiaocheng unhappy because of her inexperience. [[7599 旁白 sad]]
    Such strange and abnormal emotions shouldn't have appeared, but she couldn't help but overthink at this moment. [[7600 旁白 neutral]]
    In the future, should I practice more? [[7601 苏桃 neutral]]
    This thought flashed through Su Tao's mind, startling her. [[7602 旁白 neutral]]
    Cold sweat broke out. [[7603 旁白 neutral]]
    Just then, Chi Xiaocheng's voice softly echoed in her ear again, "Is this little bit really enough? How about one more time?" [[7604 池小橙 neutral]]
    Try again? [[7605 苏桃 neutral]]
    Just for practice. [[7606 苏桃 neutral]]
    Anyway, there might be many more times in the future. [[7607 苏桃 neutral]]
    Following that sentence, it was as if countless Chi Xiaochengs were blowing and whispering in her ear, extending delicate fingers to pluck at her heartstrings. [[7608 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao trembled slightly and quickly chuckled dryly at Chi Xiaocheng, "No... it's fine, didn't I say, just try it, this is enough." [[7609 苏桃 neutral]]
    Yes. [[7610 旁白 neutral]]
    Just once. [[7611 旁白 neutral]]
    Only once. [[7612 旁白 neutral]]
    If she didn't do that, Xiaocheng might become even more yandere, and then it wouldn't be solved by just a kiss. [[7613 旁白 neutral]]
    With that cute appearance, Su Tao truly didn't want Chi Xiaocheng to become pathological. [[7614 旁白 neutral]]
    To stop the topic, Su Tao closed her eyes and grabbed that small hand again. [[7615 旁白 neutral]]
    Rubbing her fingertips, she deliberately showed a look of affection. [[7616 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao even thought, if only Xiaocheng wasn't a yandere. [[7617 旁白 sad]]
    But that was just a wish. [[7618 旁白 neutral]]
    Fortunately, this attempt was something she could control. [[7619 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng indeed didn't further darken, which showed that when facing Dongfang Yang and Si Chen, Chi Xiaocheng's darkening could be controlled by herself! [[7620 旁白 happy]]
    After that, she just needed to continue testing Chi Xiaocheng's bottom line little by little. [[7621 旁白 neutral]]
    The treatment itself was what Su Tao wanted, but she didn't know that she had already fallen into Chi Xiaocheng's trap. [[7622 旁白 neutral]]
    Tao Tao is so proactive, how can I not give her some reward? [[7623 池小橙 happy]]
    Since you want to cure me so much. [[7624 池小橙 neutral]]
    Then I'll pretend your treatment is very effective. [[7625 池小橙 neutral]]
    And then make you fall in love with me. [[7626 池小橙 happy]]
    After pretending to continue for a while longer, she ended this experience that felt strange to her. [[7627 旁白 neutral]]
    She gently looked up, Su Tao met Chi Xiaocheng's happy and satisfied smile, and nervously asked, "Xi... Xiaocheng, that... thanks for the treat?" [[7628 苏桃 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng nodded gently, and asked expectantly, "Do you like it?" [[7629 池小橙 neutral]]
    Su Tao swallowed. [[7630 旁白 neutral]]
    She didn't directly say she liked it, but instead tentatively said, "It's not dislike, but... but I still need to get used to it." [[7631 苏桃 neutral]]
    Before, as long as she didn't say she liked it, Xiaocheng would probably have an opinion, right? [[7632 旁白 neutral]]
    Now [[7633 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng just smiled shyly, "It's good that Tao Tao doesn't dislike it~" [[7634 池小橙 happy]]
    "Uh... Xiaocheng's body is too weak now." Su Tao changed the subject, "You should recover your strength more, otherwise... you'll get tired easily." [[7635 苏桃 neutral]]
    "Mhm!" [[7636 池小橙 happy]]
    Chi Xiaocheng nodded seriously, "I will work hard to recover my health!" [[7637 池小橙 happy]]
    There was no hint of yandere transformation. [[7638 旁白 neutral]]
    Obedient and cute. [[7639 旁白 happy]]
    Su Tao immediately became excited. [[7640 旁白 happy]]
    Her goal was achieved! [[7641 旁白 happy]]
    She controlled Xiaocheng and made her obedient. [[7642 旁白 happy]]
    At the same time, she didn't show any yandere tendencies when faced with her probing, this was the first milestone in the treatment! [[7643 旁白 happy]]
    Doctor Cheng, Chengcheng, thank you so much. [[7644 苏桃 happy]]
    Su Tao thanked the two of them inwardly, and after rinsing her mouth, she happily chatted with Chi Xiaocheng. [[7645 旁白 happy]]
    It wasn't until noon, when she had to go to work, that Su Tao bid farewell to Chi Xiaocheng. [[7646 旁白 neutral]]
    It was as if a huge stone had fallen from her heart, feeling incredibly light. [[7647 旁白 happy]]
    The past suppression, confusion, and fear were dispelled by hope and the future at this moment. [[7648 旁白 happy]]
    Pretending to like Xiaocheng and then treating her, as long as she faced it and accepted it patiently, there would definitely be a chance! [[7649 旁白 happy]]
    As for Chi Xiaocheng, she successfully completed the discharge procedures in the afternoon. [[7650 旁白 neutral]]
    "Time to go home, but it's snowing again, so I'll just take a taxi." [[7651 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng looked at the sky, found that the snow wasn't light, and took out her phone to call a taxi. [[7652 旁白 neutral]]
    But the moment she saw her phone balance, her smile stiffened again. [[7653 旁白 neutral]]
    237 yuan! [[7654 旁白 sad]]
    Her brother had transferred two thousand yuan before, but Chi Xiaocheng hadn't saved a single bit these past few days. [[7655 旁白 neutral]]
    Buying clothes, the camera prepared for the dark room, the air conditioning at home running non-stop for several days resulting in a large electricity bill, plus some scattered frivolous expenses. [[7656 旁白 neutral]]
    She was once again in a financial crisis. [[7657 旁白 sad]]
    "These days, money is becoming less and less valuable!" [[7658 池小橙 sad]]
    Chi Xiaocheng sighed inwardly and no longer planned to take a taxi. [[7659 旁白 neutral]]
    The snow wasn't heavy, and taking a shortcut would get her home faster. [[7660 旁白 neutral]]
    Pedestrians hurried along the street, vehicles occasionally drove by, and specks of snow fell on Chi Xiaocheng's brown long hair, elongating her lonely silhouette. [[7661 旁白 neutral]]
    Entering a deserted alley, in the original owner's memory, there used to be many delinquent girls who couldn't afford school huddling together for warmth here. Now that it was winter, the old houses in the alley couldn't withstand such cold either. [[7662 旁白 neutral]]
    But it wasn't completely deserted. [[7663 旁白 neutral]]
    Turning the corner, Chi Xiaocheng found a small figure huddled in a corner of a wall, a worn-out coat covering her body, but unable to hide her trembling. [[7664 旁白 neutral]]
    The small figure's long hair reached her waist, but it was extremely messy, and unlike Chi Xiaocheng's beautiful hair, her black hair was dry and split, which was caused by long-term malnutrition. [[7665 旁白 neutral]]
    More importantly, this figure looked somewhat familiar to Chi Xiaocheng. [[7666 旁白 neutral]]
    She walked over, tilted her head, and curiously said, "Liu Guijia?" [[7667 池小橙 neutral]]
    The figure seemed to react, looking up at Chi Xiaocheng in confusion. [[7668 旁白 neutral]]
    Meeting those eyes, Chi Xiaocheng then confirmed who the person in front of her was. [[7669 旁白 neutral]]
    It was the little follower who came to her house with Liu Guijia back then. [[7670 旁白 neutral]]
