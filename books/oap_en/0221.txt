Chapter 221: Jumbled Memories [[19156 旁白 neutral]]
If it were simple amnesia, Dongfang Yang could understand her forgetting the recent Su Tao. [[19157 旁白 neutral]]
He also found it normal that she still remembered working at his cafe, though her memory seemed to be lost from a later point. [[19158 旁白 neutral]]
But when he got an answer to his probing question, Dongfang Yang realized something was wrong. [[19159 旁白 neutral]]
The time Ye Liang wanted to kill her… if I remember correctly, the conflict officially started during her second hospital stay, right? [[19160 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, her relationship with Su Tao had already returned to normal. They were inseparable for a while. If her memory stopped there, how could she forget Su Tao and be so cold to her? [[19161 旁白 neutral]]
Unless… [[19162 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang didn't dare to consider the possibility that might devastate Su Tao, so he quickly responded to Chi Xiaocheng, "Ye Liang definitely deserved to die, but Chi Xiaocheng, you can't talk about Su Tao like that. When Ye Liang tried to kill you, she was not on his side." [[19163 东方阳 neutral]]
"What do you mean she wasn't!" Chi Xiaocheng said unhappily. "Sister Su Tao... Su Tao and Ye Liang told me I was being unreasonable and should stop clinging to her like a child. When Ye Liang threatened to hit me, she just let him. I remember all of this very clearly." [[19164 池小橙 angry]]
"And that time I met Ye Liang on the street, he even thought about killing me. If my brother hadn't saved me, I might have died!" [[19165 池小橙 angry]]
"And Su Tao? After she found out about it, she said nothing and ignored me, acting like it never happened!" [[19166 池小橙 angry]]
She didn't even call her 'sister' anymore, frowning as she asked Dongfang Yang, "Boss, are you remembering things wrong? She ignored me and blamed me, doesn't that mean she was on Ye Liang's side? She even went with Ye Liang to a banquet!" [[19167 池小橙 angry]]
As Chi Xiaocheng continued her complaints, Dongfang Yang's heart sank. [[19168 旁白 sad]]
He knew which incidents Chi Xiaocheng was talking about. [[19169 旁白 neutral]]
He remembered the time Ye Liang tried to kill her very clearly. After Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng's relationship improved, they went shopping together and were planning to visit his Yangyang Cat Cafe. [[19170 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao went to the restroom, and the lone Chi Xiaocheng happened to run into Ye Liang. [[19171 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, Ye Liang wanted to kill Chi Xiaocheng; the knife even pierced her body. [[19172 旁白 neutral]]
It was because of this incident that Su Tao broke ties with Ye Liang. [[19173 旁白 neutral]]
After that, Chi Song arrived and kicked Ye Liang's balls, which started the feud. This was the trigger that made them turn on each other. Later, Ye Liang not only sent people to hunt down Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng but even hired a sniper. [[19174 旁白 neutral]]
How could Su Tao have been on Ye Liang's side during this incident? [[19175 旁白 neutral]]
She completely broke up with Ye Liang for Chi Xiaocheng's sake! [[19176 旁白 neutral]]
But now Chi Xiaocheng was saying Ye Liang nearly killed her, and Su Tao did nothing about it? [[19177 旁白 neutral]]
What kind of joke was this. [[19178 旁白 neutral]]
The banquet was even more ridiculous. [[19179 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, Chi Xiaocheng had ruined the banquet so they couldn't attend, and Su Tao had also refused to go later. Nothing like that ever happened. [[19180 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed Chi Xiaocheng's problem wasn't just amnesia; her memories were actually jumbled! [[19181 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang wasn't a professional doctor, so he didn't dare to make a conclusion. He just continued to ask Chi Xiaocheng for some more details. [[19182 旁白 neutral]]
He only stopped asking when she started to get a little impatient, then he strangely asked one last question, "So, Chi Xiaocheng, what are your feelings for me?" [[19183 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head, looking at Dongfang Yang with some confusion. "What do you mean, 'what are my feelings'?" [[19184 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang gave a slightly goofy smile and said shyly, "I mean... your feelings for me. Is it like... love... or something else?" [[19185 东方阳 neutral]]
From their conversation, Dongfang Yang noticed that Chi Xiaocheng's memory of him hadn't changed much. [[19186 旁白 neutral]]
But if Su Tao was involved, her role would be erased. [[19187 旁白 neutral]]
But asking someone directly if they liked you was almost like a confession, which made Dongfang Yang feel embarrassed. [[19188 旁白 neutral]]
He looked away, staring awkwardly at a potted plant nearby. [[19189 旁白 neutral]]
And in that moment, he didn't notice Chi Xiaocheng looking at him like he was an idiot for a second. [[19190 旁白 neutral]]
Then she said slowly, "Boss... no, Dongfang Yang, please don't joke around. You're a good person, and I just think of you as a brother." [[19191 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang froze when he heard that. [[19192 旁白 neutral]]
He quickly forced an awkward laugh. "Haha, right, of course. I was just asking, don't get the wrong idea." [[19193 东方阳 neutral]]
After saying that, he stood up and patted his red robe. "You still have to cooperate with the doctors for more checks, right? I won't disturb your rest. I'll get going now." [[19194 东方阳 neutral]]
"Okay, bye-bye." [[19195 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng waved her hand politely. [[19196 旁白 neutral]]
She looked very calm and normal, without any trace of strangeness, but Dongfang Yang knew Chi Xiaocheng's memories were jumbled. [[19197 旁白 neutral]]
And it wasn't just about Su Tao! [[19198 旁白 neutral]]
After leaving the hospital room, Dongfang Yang clicked his tongue. "This is a bit tricky. I thought Chi Xiaocheng's memories were only jumbled when it came to Su Tao, but it turns out my memories are mixed up too." [[19199 东方阳 sad]]
"She used to like me so much, but with her jumbled memories, she says she only sees me as a brother and even gave me the 'good person' card." [[19200 东方阳 sad]]
"Otherwise, she should have blushed when I asked if she liked me." [[19201 东方阳 sad]]
Dongfang Yang headed back to Professor Su's office. The moment he saw Su Tao, he said to her, "We'll have to wait for the doctors to check on Chi Xiaocheng's specific situation and then get a diagnosis from Dr. Chen and Dr. Lin to be sure." [[19202 东方阳 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao asked anxiously, "Dongfang Yang, does Xiaocheng still remember you? How is her attitude towards you? What's your personal feeling about her condition?" [[19203 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang gestured for Su Tao not to worry. "Of course she remembers me. She used to like you a lot, right? And then she became cold to you. It's the same situation with me." [[19204 东方阳 neutral]]
"Her feelings for me have also become confused and twisted." [[19205 东方阳 sad]]
Su Tao pressed, "Is she very cold to you too?" [[19206 苏桃 sad]]
"Umm..." Dongfang Yang rubbed his nose, thinking about what just happened. [[19207 东方阳 neutral]]
It's probably better not to tell anyone about getting the 'good person' card. [[19208 旁白 neutral]]
So he replied, "Yeah... more or less. She's definitely not as warm to me as she used to be." [[19209 东方阳 sad]]
Dongfang Yang's answer brought Su Tao a small sense of relief. "If her memories are jumbled, is there any way to restore them?" [[19210 苏桃 neutral]]
"Her schizophrenia might be hard to treat, but just getting her old memories back shouldn't be too difficult. There are many ways. There have been cases where a master used hypnosis and guidance to help someone recover their memories. There are countless examples like that, so don't worry." [[19211 东方阳 neutral]]
This reassurance made Su Tao breathe a sigh of relief. [[19212 旁白 neutral]]
If Chi Xiaocheng stayed like this, she really wouldn't know what to do. [[19213 旁白 sad]]
She could face her yandere side again, but Su Tao didn't want to lose those painful yet beautiful memories. [[19214 旁白 sad]]
Compared to the old Xiaocheng who followed her around like a little sister, calling her 'jiejie'. [[19215 旁白 neutral]]
She now preferred the Xiaocheng who called her "Taotao." [[19216 旁白 happy]]
As Su Tao thought about this, she gripped her phone tightly, looking expectantly at the chat box with the ID "Doctor Cheng." [[19217 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't replied yet. [[19218 旁白 neutral]]
But if it was him, Doctor Cheng, who had supported her all this time and was familiar with yandere cases, he would surely have a solution this time too, right? [[19219 旁白 neutral]]
