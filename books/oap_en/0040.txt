Chapter 40 You Can Only Be Mine! [[3409 旁白 neutral]]
After casually buying a bottle of mineral water on the roadside, Chi Xiaocheng quickly arrived at the Moonlight Cafe. [[3410 旁白 neutral]]
At this time, her head was still wrapped in gauze to conceal her identity. [[3411 旁白 neutral]]
Covered by her tea-colored hair, it looked like a headscarf, giving her sweet and lovely appearance a vibrant touch. [[3412 旁白 neutral]]
Yesterday's hoodie was stained with blood and sent for washing. Chi Xiaocheng didn't have any autumn clothes, so she reluctantly wore a sailor suit, with an extra T-shirt underneath for warmth. [[3413 旁白 neutral]]
Already cute, this sailor suit was like a layer of stars draped over her, making it impossible to look away. [[3414 旁白 neutral]]
It was truly a case of prioritizing cuteness over warmth. [[3415 旁白 neutral]]
Walking into the cafe, she saw Chen Qian anxiously waiting there. [[3416 旁白 neutral]]
After a glance, she greeted Butler Chu at the counter, "Good morning, Uncle Chu San, I'm here for work." [[3417 池小橙 happy]]
Butler Chu smiled, "The prices at our cafe are very high. Although it's next to the school, there aren't many customers in a day. Miss Chi can just find a place to rest. I'll watch over things here." [[3418 褚三 neutral]]
Sure enough, Dongfang Yang sent her here just to pass the time. [[3419 旁白 neutral]]
She had been to the cafe twice and hadn't seen a single customer. [[3420 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at the price list. [[3421 旁白 neutral]]
Good heavens, the cheapest cup of coffee was over 100 yuan! [[3422 旁白 neutral]]
She had less than 300 yuan in total. If she bought winter clothes, she wouldn't even have money for food. [[3423 旁白 neutral]]
Sighing inwardly, Chi Xiaocheng walked towards Chen Qian. [[3424 旁白 neutral]]
Sitting in front of her, she handed over the mineral water, "Drink." [[3425 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian looked at the bottle of Nongfu Spring and instinctively shivered, "Is this the antidote?" [[3426 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said lightly, "You'd better speak softly. I've checked, there are no cameras here, but it's not good to be too loud." [[3427 池小橙 neutral]]
Butler Chu was Dongfang Yang's man. [[3428 旁白 neutral]]
If it weren't for the elegant background music, they would probably be able to hear them even if they spoke softly. [[3429 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian swallowed, carefully examining the bottle of mineral water. [[3430 旁白 neutral]]
The bottle cap was unopened, and the label hadn't been touched. [[3431 旁白 neutral]]
Even the production date was clearly visible. [[3432 旁白 neutral]]
It looked exactly like a bottle of mineral water just bought from a convenience store. [[3433 旁白 neutral]]
"Is this really the antidote?" [[3434 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said, "It's temporary. This is a two-week supply. You only need to drink half a bottle at a time. It's a disguise, just like last time. If you don't believe me, try the taste." [[3435 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian was half-skeptical. She twisted open the cap and sniffed. [[3436 旁白 neutral]]
No smell. [[3437 旁白 neutral]]
She took another sip. [[3438 旁白 neutral]]
"A little sweet?" [[3439 陈倩 neutral]]
The taste was like grape juice. [[3440 旁白 neutral]]
The last time she drank bitter poison. [[3441 旁白 neutral]]
Tasting a different flavor, Chen Qian no longer doubted and drank half the bottle in one gulp. [[3442 旁白 neutral]]
After finishing, she let out a long sigh of relief. [[3443 旁白 neutral]]
She felt a little better, less sleepy, whether it was psychological or not. [[3444 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing her finish, Chi Xiaocheng asked, "Tell me about Su Tao and Si Chen." [[3445 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian nodded, already used to being a double agent for a week, "I don't know what they talked about during their 10-minute call last night, but I saw Su Tao leave early this morning. She might be going to see Si Chen." [[3446 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow when she heard the word "leave," "Was she dressed up?" [[3447 池小橙 neutral]]
"Uh..." Chen Qian didn't understand why Chi Xiaocheng asked that, but she answered truthfully, "No, she just wore a down jacket and left." [[3448 陈倩 neutral]]
"Then it's not a date." [[3449 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng murmured. She was really afraid that Su Tao would go on a date with one of the male leads. [[3450 旁白 neutral]]
In her eyes, Su Tao was already hers. [[3451 旁白 neutral]]
She would never allow these male leads to touch her. [[3452 旁白 neutral]]
But that unconscious murmur made Chen Qian's eyes look strange. [[3453 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't think much of it and continued, "Besides last night, the day before yesterday, Su Tao also had lunch with Si Chen. When she returned to the dorm, I subtly asked her, and she said that Si Chen had studied psychology and she just asked him a few questions." [[3454 陈倩 neutral]]
Upon hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng's sense of crisis immediately increased! [[3455 旁白 neutral]]
At this critical juncture. [[3456 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen also had the bonus of psychology. [[3457 旁白 neutral]]
She must have been asking about her yandere tendencies! [[3458 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly asked, "And then?" [[3459 池小橙 neutral]]
"Then I don't know." Chen Qian pouted, "Although I tried to stay by her side as you told me, when she was with those young masters, I didn't have a chance to follow. We're not in the same circle." [[3460 陈倩 neutral]]
This was indeed a problem. [[3461 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian couldn't enter the upper circles. [[3462 旁白 neutral]]
If she didn't have some connection with Su Tao, Dongfang Yang probably wouldn't even look at her. [[3463 旁白 neutral]]
As an informant, she was useful, but not much. [[3464 旁白 neutral]]
"Did anything else happen this week?" [[3465 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian frowned, thinking for a moment, then suddenly remembered something, "I almost forgot, there's one thing related to you." [[3466 陈倩 neutral]]
"What?" [[3467 池小橙 neutral]]
"I found out when you were hospitalized. I was going to tell you when you were discharged, but I almost forgot." Chen Qian slowly said: [[3468 陈倩 neutral]]
"I heard you angered Ye Liang and ruined his banquet. Su Tao, to apologize, agreed to be Ye Liang's maid for three days. The date is the 15th, Wednesday." [[3469 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "¿" [[3470 池小橙 neutral]]
Her originally crimson eyes suddenly became deep and terrifying, "Tao Tao is going to be Ye Liang's... maid?" [[3471 池小橙 angry]]
For some reason, Chen Qian felt that Chi Xiaocheng was particularly terrifying at this moment. After swallowing, she nodded, "According to Su Tao, it seems she made Ye Liang lose face at that banquet, and then Ye Liang forcefully demanded that she be his maid for three days." [[3472 陈倩 neutral]]
"Also, it seems she said that this would make Ye Liang calm down and stop targeting you." [[3473 陈倩 neutral]]
"Hehe... hehehehe..." [[3474 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sneered. [[3475 旁白 neutral]]
She wondered why Ye Liang hadn't come to find her all these days. So this was why. [[3476 旁白 neutral]]
In the original novel, there was no such plot development. [[3477 旁白 neutral]]
Her butterfly effect was flapping faster and faster. [[3478 旁白 neutral]]
Considering her condition, Su Tao would definitely not tell her about this, and even other informed people would be warned by Su Tao not to tell her. [[3479 旁白 neutral]]
If it weren't for Chen Qian, she wouldn't even know that Su Tao was being taken advantage of by Ye Liang! [[3480 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought for a moment, then reached into her pocket. [[3481 旁白 neutral]]
Then she took out a small pill and threw it to Chen Qian, "You did well. This is your reward." [[3482 池小橙 neutral]]
"What is this?" [[3483 陈倩 neutral]]
Chen Qian picked up the small pill. [[3484 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said expressionlessly, "It's a black technology that can help you remove blackheads from your nose. It works in half a day." [[3485 池小橙 neutral]]
"Really?!" [[3486 陈倩 happy]]
Chen Qian's skin wasn't very good, and she always had to apply thick foundation when she went out. [[3487 旁白 neutral]]
She had witnessed Chi Xiaocheng's power, and if this thing was real... [[3488 旁白 neutral]]
Her face was filled with joy. She wasn't afraid that Chi Xiaocheng was lying to her, and immediately swallowed it. [[3489 旁白 neutral]]
[Detected supporting character Chen Qian generating gratitude towards the host.] [[3490 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion points +7] [[3491 系统 neutral]]
"This..." [[3492 旁白 neutral]]
It was an unexpected surprise. [[3493 旁白 neutral]]
This pill itself cost 30 emotion points in the system, and Chi Xiaocheng used it to win people over. [[3494 旁白 neutral]]
She had forgotten that, according to the system's settings, any named character in the original work, whether protagonist or supporting character. [[3495 旁白 neutral]]
Could generate emotion points! [[3496 旁白 neutral]]
And Chen Qian happened to be a rather important cannon fodder villain. [[3497 旁白 neutral]]
She was still worried that she had no trump card against Ye Liang. [[3498 旁白 neutral]]
If that's the case... [[3499 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took out her phone and looked at her contacts. [[3500 旁白 neutral]]
Then she slowly tapped on the ID with the note "Invincible Brother." [[3501 旁白 neutral]]
Just wait, Tao Tao, I will definitely save you from Ye Liang. [[3502 池小橙 neutral]]
You are mine! [[3503 池小橙 neutral]]
You can only like me! [[3504 池小橙 neutral]]
