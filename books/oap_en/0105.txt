Chapter 105: I Don't Want to Act Like a Yandere Anymore [[9079]]
The pupils, which had been clear from the tranquilizer, gradually turned a strange red color again. [[9080 旁白 neutral]]
To take that caring smile, that warm embrace, and even her entire being for herself! [[9081 旁白 neutral]]
But just then, the System in her mind spoke up. [[9082 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, is Su Tao really the only person you want?" [[9083 系统 neutral]]
Did she want a substitute for her ex-girlfriend? [[9084 旁白 neutral]]
No, that wasn't it. [[9085 旁白 neutral]]
She just wanted someone to love her. [[9086 旁白 sad]]
Maybe they didn't need to be perfect, they could have their own flaws and throw little tantrums, but as long as they didn't betray her and loved her, that would be enough. [[9087 旁白 sad]]
Coincidentally, she had merged with the original owner's memories. [[9088 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao was the kind of girl who was the most captivating of them all. [[9089 旁白 neutral]]
Is possession really the same as love? [[9090 旁白 neutral]]
But what if Su Tao didn't like her back? [[9091 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng silently lowered her head, walked listlessly to the living room for a drink of water, and then slowly climbed into bed. [[9092 旁白 sad]]
The tranquilizer only had a temporary effect. She curled up in bed, pulling the blanket tightly around herself. The new brown teddy bear pillow sat alone on the side. [[9093 旁白 sad]]
In the end, it couldn't comfort its owner. [[9094 旁白 sad]]
It could only lean against the wall, lifelessly watching the small girl in front of it hug herself uneasily, curled up and trembling. [[9095 旁白 sad]]
*Ding-ling~* [[9096 旁白 neutral]]
The phone rang. [[9097 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng remained curled up in her blanket and asked, "System, who's calling?" [[9098 池小橙 neutral]]
"Replying to Host, it's the female lead, Su Tao." [[9099 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng poked her head out, then quickly pulled it back in. [[9100 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't dare to answer. She was scared. [[9101 旁白 sad]]
She was afraid Su Tao would call to say she was only pretending to like her. [[9102 旁白 sad]]
Even though she knew Su Tao wouldn't say that, the memories lingering in her mind were like a nightmare, choking her. [[9103 旁白 sad]]
The one she cared about wasn't her, after all. [[9104 旁白 sad]]
It had always been the original Xiaocheng, whose place she had taken. [[9105 旁白 sad]]
And hadn't she also been playing the part of the well-behaved, likable Xiaocheng all this time? [[9106 旁白 sad]]
Outside the window, the snow fell harder and harder. [[9107 旁白 neutral]]
The snow was thick, making it difficult for the bicycle wheels to move even on the road. [[9108 旁白 neutral]]
Puffs of mist came out with each breath, accompanied by anxious gasps. Her dark hair was almost white with snow. [[9109 旁白 neutral]]
What was originally a 15-minute journey took almost half an hour. [[9110 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stopped her bicycle and hurried into the residential complex. [[9111 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she reached the door, she ran into Chi Song, who was about to leave. [[9112 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song was stunned for a moment. "Xiao Tao, what are you doing here?" [[9113 池松 neutral]]
It's almost two in the morning. [[9114 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao shook her cold body and asked anxiously, "Brother Chi Song, is Xiaocheng home?" [[9115 苏桃 neutral]]
"She should be sleeping in her room. Did something happen?" [[9116 池松 neutral]]
Hearing Chi Song's words, Su Tao breathed a sigh of relief. "It's nothing. Xiaocheng called and said she missed me, so I came over to check on her." [[9117 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Song gave a helpless smile. "My little sister can be so silly, saying things like that in the middle of the night." [[9118 池松 happy]]
But seeing that Su Tao had really come, he couldn't hide the joy in his eyes. He said slowly, "She's in her room. You can go in by yourself. I have something to do, so I'll be leaving now." [[9119 池松 happy]]
Something to do this late? [[9120 旁白 neutral]]
Watching Chi Song's hurried back as he left, Su Tao didn't think much of it. [[9121 旁白 neutral]]
She changed her shoes and quickly went to Chi Xiaocheng's door. [[9122 旁白 neutral]]
She could see light from under the door, so Xiaocheng probably wasn't asleep yet. [[9123 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao opened the door quietly, making only a tiny sound. [[9124 旁白 neutral]]
Her heart tightened when she didn't see Chi Xiaocheng in the room. [[9125 旁白 sad]]
Then she saw a lump under the covers on the bed, and her tense mood relaxed a lot. [[9126 旁白 neutral]]
It seems like everything is fine. [[9127 旁白 neutral]]
The sudden phone call and the strange question had kept her on edge the whole way. [[9128 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't riding the bike fast enough; she wished she could just carry it and run over. [[9129 旁白 neutral]]
Looks like she's asleep now? [[9130 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even turn off the light. [[9131 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't want to disturb Chi Xiaocheng, so she turned to switch off the light and leave. But then, her sharp eyes suddenly spotted a syringe on the floor. [[9132 旁白 neutral]]
Her pupils constricted slightly. [[9133 旁白 neutral]]
The tip of the syringe had a wet mark on it, clearly it had just been used. [[9134 旁白 neutral]]
A label on it had three words: Tranquilizer. [[9135 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's expression changed instantly. [[9136 旁白 sad]]
She couldn't help but remember what Doctor Lin had said. [[9137 旁白 neutral]]
Mild schizophrenia! [[9138 旁白 sad]]
It had reached the point where she needed to inject tranquilizers. Was it really just mild? [[9139 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao stood by the bed, looking quietly at the bundle of blankets. [[9140 旁白 neutral]]
What should I do? [[9141 旁白 neutral]]
Wake her up and ask what happened? [[9142 旁白 neutral]]
Sit by the bed, watch over her quietly, and comfort her when she wakes up? [[9143 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, a helpless whimper came from under the covers. "Taotao... don't leave me..." [[9144 池小橙 sad]]
Is she having a nightmare? [[9145 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's gaze softened, and she took off her coat. [[9146 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't had time to take off her pajamas in the dorm, so now she didn't even need to change. [[9147 旁白 neutral]]
Lifting the blanket slightly, Su Tao saw Chi Xiaocheng curled up in a ball. [[9148 旁白 neutral]]
She knew this was a self-protective posture from a deep lack of security. [[9149 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps feeling the cold after the blanket was lifted, Chi Xiaocheng faced Su Tao and opened her eyes slightly. [[9150 旁白 neutral]]
Meeting that gentle gaze, she was completely stunned. [[9151 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled sweetly. "Having a nightmare? Don't be afraid, I'm here." [[9152 苏桃 happy]]
She slipped into the covers and gently wrapped her arms around the stunned Chi Xiaocheng. [[9153 旁白 happy]]
Only when she was surrounded by warmth and a reassuring light fragrance did Chi Xiaocheng come to her senses, her voice trembling with disbelief, "Tao... Taotao, what are you doing here?" [[9154 池小橙 neutral]]
She was afraid this was a dream. [[9155 旁白 sad]]
Although she didn't know what had happened. [[9156 旁白 neutral]]
But that didn't stop Su Tao from comforting the insecure girl in her arms. She pretended to think and said, "Xiaocheng, you hung up so quickly. Of course I came over to answer your question." [[9157 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's confused voice sounded, "Question?" [[9158 池小橙 neutral]]
"That's right," Su Tao said. "Didn't you say I hesitated when I said I liked you?" [[9159 苏桃 happy]]
"Silly girl, I wasn't hesitating about whether I like you or not." [[9160 苏桃 happy]]
"I was hesitating about how much I like you~" [[9161 苏桃 happy]]
Almost perfectly in tune with her feelings, Su Tao's voice was gentle and caring, and her hands held her close, as if trying to express her affection through her actions. [[9162 旁白 happy]]
Is this affection real? [[9163 旁白 neutral]]
Does it matter if it's real or fake? [[9164 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng just wanted to hear those words, to have that kind of support. [[9165 旁白 sad]]
She longed for someone to love her like this, that's all. [[9166 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao could feel the small girl in her arms clutching her clothes tightly when she said those words. [[9167 旁白 neutral]]
The slight trembling gradually subsided. [[9168 旁白 neutral]]
Her little head buried in her chest, her breathing slowly became steady. [[9169 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao reached out and stroked Chi Xiaocheng's head gently. "Xiaocheng, hold me a little tighter." [[9170 苏桃 happy]]
That way, you won't be scared. [[9171 旁白 happy]]
That way, you can feel my warmth even more. [[9172 旁白 happy]]
That way, you won't think I'll abandon you. [[9173 旁白 happy]]
Even if the affection I express is just an act, I will stay by your side. [[9174 旁白 happy]]
It was like that before, and it won't change in the future. [[9175 旁白 happy]]
The small girl in her arms finally moved, clinging to her like an octopus, making it a little difficult for Su Tao to breathe. [[9176 旁白 happy]]
But, she could definitely feel her heartbeat gradually calming down. [[9177 旁白 happy]]
After some time, Chi Xiaocheng timidly asked from her arms, "Taotao, if I weren't sick." [[9178 池小橙 sad]]
--If I weren't a yandere. [[9179 旁白 sad]]
"If I were a good girl." [[9180 池小橙 sad]]
--If I stopped acting like a yandere and putting pressure on you, and just listened to you obediently. [[9181 旁白 sad]]
"Would you always stay by my side?" [[9182 池小橙 sad]]
