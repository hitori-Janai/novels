Chapter 36 Split Personality [[3060 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, is that you?" [[3061 池小橙 neutral]]
As soon as Su Tao hung up the phone, Chi Xiaocheng slowly woke up from her "coma." [[3062 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice was hoarse, with a hint of a sob. [[3063 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's expression softened, and she asked with concern, "Xiaocheng, don't speak yet. You're still injured. Dongfang Yang's doctor will be here soon." [[3064 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng forced a smile, "It's okay, Tao Tao. My forehead hurts a little, and my face too, but otherwise I'm fine." [[3065 池小橙 neutral]]
"Face..." [[3066 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao then noticed, gently wiping away the water stains on Chi Xiaocheng's face, that there was a clear bruise. [[3067 旁白 neutral]]
She gently brushed aside Chi Xiaocheng's hair and saw a wide but not deep gash on her forehead, still oozing a faint red. [[3068 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao gasped, forcing herself to calm down. [[3069 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had been observing Su Tao's subtle expressions and could easily guess what she was thinking. [[3070 旁白 neutral]]
With a nervous yet relieved tone, she asked, "That, Tao... Tao Tao, my face, it's okay, right? If it becomes ugly, will you... will you abandon me?" [[3071 池小橙 sad]]
Her lips trembled, as if she was about to cry, "She just... just said she wanted to scratch my face. If I hadn't dodged that knife, I would have really... really been disfigured, boohoohoo..." [[3072 池小橙 sad]]
"Tao Tao, please... please don't abandon me!" [[3073 池小橙 sad]]
Panic, helplessness, her acting in full swing, Chi Xiaocheng's tears streamed down. [[3074 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, who had been rational, immediately felt a surge of anger when she heard this! [[3075 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out and grabbed an apple nearby, squeezing it with force as if to vent her emotions. [[3076 旁白 neutral]]
"Thump!" [[3077 旁白 neutral]]
The apple was crushed. [[3078 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, who had been pretending to cry, was stunned. [[3079 旁白 neutral]]
She knew Su Tao had some fighting ability. [[3080 旁白 neutral]]
But wasn't this a bit too much? [[3081 旁白 neutral]]
How did the original owner manage to knock Su Tao out and lock her in that dark room? [[3082 旁白 neutral]]
But despite the shock, the act couldn't stop. [[3083 旁白 neutral]]
The crying had to continue. [[3084 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until Su Tao gently wiped away her tears that Chi Xiaocheng slowly whimpered, "Tao Tao?" [[3085 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao showed a reassuring smile, "Relax, when did I ever say I'd abandon Xiaocheng?" [[3086 苏桃 neutral]]
"Don't ever think such things again." After a warning, Su Tao checked her up and down again, confirming that Chi Xiaocheng only had a scratch on her forehead and some lingering marks on her face, but was otherwise fine. [[3087 旁白 neutral]]
Helping Chi Xiaocheng to a chair, Su Tao said softly, "Xiaocheng, wait a moment, I'll give you some simple treatment." [[3088 苏桃 neutral]]
With that, she walked towards the cabinet under the TV, skillfully opened it, and took out the emergency first-aid kit. [[3089 旁白 neutral]]
However, as she was choosing the medicine, she couldn't help but pause. [[3090 旁白 neutral]]
This scene seemed to have happened frequently in the past. [[3091 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since Xiaocheng moved in during her third year of high school, there was a period of cohabitation where Xiaocheng would occasionally come back injured. [[3092 旁白 neutral]]
She just said she fell, could it be... [[3093 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's heart sank. She took the disinfectant, cotton swabs, and gauze and walked towards Chi Xiaocheng, "The disinfection process might sting a little, bear with it, okay?" [[3094 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's fine, I'm used to it!" [[3095 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng obediently closed her eyes and tilted her head slightly. [[3096 旁白 neutral]]
The system's intermittent voice echoed in her mind. [[3097 旁白 neutral]]
[Emotion points +3...] [[3098 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion points +5...] [[3099 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion points +10...] [[3100 系统 neutral]]
She knew that Su Tao had experienced a significant emotional fluctuation because of her words, which was captured by the system. [[3101 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, emotion points would gradually decrease with the adaptability of the various protagonists. [[3102 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't repeatedly exploit the same situation to farm emotion points. [[3103 旁白 neutral]]
For example, when she played the victim, Su Tao's initial heartache would generate a lot of emotion points. [[3104 旁白 neutral]]
Later, even if she played the victim again and Su Tao felt the same heartache, the emotion points gained would be much less. [[3105 旁白 neutral]]
Considering everything, every single point was crucial! [[3106 旁白 neutral]]
Stop the bleeding, apply medicine, and temporarily wrap her forehead with gauze. [[3107 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was not a professional doctor, but she had learned some basic first aid. [[3108 旁白 neutral]]
The exact situation would have to wait for a real doctor's assessment. [[3109 旁白 neutral]]
Speak of the devil, and he shall appear. [[3110 旁白 neutral]]
The already open door was pushed open, and Dongfang Yang quickly walked in with two doctors. His first reaction was the pool of crimson on the floor, and his pupils contracted, "Hey, what's going on?" [[3111 东方阳 sad]]
Su Tao stood up and explained, "It's some bad girls from Xiaocheng's high school who were bothering her. When I arrived, Xiaocheng was already injured. Taking care of Xiaocheng was more important, so I didn't chase after them." [[3112 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang gestured to the two doctors. [[3113 旁白 neutral]]
The two doctors nodded. [[3114 旁白 neutral]]
They exchanged glances, and the female doctor handed the medicine box to the male doctor, taking on the task of examining Chi Xiaocheng. [[3115 旁白 neutral]]
"There's a little bleeding, and her face has suffered trauma. Fortunately, there's no problem inside her mouth, but to prevent swelling and pain, she'll need external application. For now, she should eat light foods, and she'll recover." [[3116 医生 neutral]]
The female doctor's words made everyone present breathe a sigh of relief. [[3117 旁白 neutral]]
Immediately after, Su Tao arranged, "Xiaocheng, rest for a bit, then go take a bath." [[3118 苏桃 neutral]]
At this, Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao, her face full of anticipation, "Tao Tao, can you help me wash?" [[3119 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow when he heard this. [[3120 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao's clothes, which were also dirty from the emergency treatment. She simply said, "Why don't we wash together? I got your clothes dirty too, Tao Tao." [[3121 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's mouth twitched continuously. [[3122 旁白 neutral]]
His gaze darted between Chi Xiaocheng's face and Su Tao's face. [[3123 旁白 neutral]]
If it were before, Su Tao would have agreed without hesitation. [[3124 旁白 neutral]]
But knowing about Chi Xiaocheng's strange feelings for her, and her yandere tendencies. [[3125 旁白 neutral]]
Reason told Su Tao not to agree to this request. [[3126 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled, pursing her lips, "How about we let the doctor sister help? As a doctor, she definitely knows where not to get wet." [[3127 苏桃 neutral]]
Seeing this, Dongfang Yang stepped forward and nodded, "If you're recovering, you can wash yourself. Isn't your small place too cramped for two people?" [[3128 东方阳 neutral]]
"Okay... okay." Chi Xiaocheng looked a little disappointed, but she didn't disobey. [[3129 池小橙 sad]]
Seeing this, Su Tao rubbed her temples, a headache forming. Not only was there the issue with the bad girls, but Xiaocheng's yandere tendencies were also a big problem. If Dongfang Yang wasn't here, would she have forcefully insisted on washing together? [[3130 旁白 neutral]]
With an apologetic look, she said to Dongfang Yang, "Thank you for your trouble this time. Why don't you sit down for a bit? I'll clean up the floor." [[3131 苏桃 neutral]]
Like a diligent wife, she put on an apron and skillfully began to do housework. [[3132 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang went out, looked up at the camera in the corridor, and said to the bodyguard, "Let's go to the property management to check the surveillance footage." [[3133 东方阳 neutral]]
Upon arriving at the property management office, with his status as a young master, the security guard naturally wouldn't stop him. [[3134 旁白 neutral]]
Before long, he saw the scene on the monitor where Chi Xiaocheng and Liu Guijia met. [[3135 旁白 neutral]]
Facing such a bad girl, Chi Xiaocheng on the screen was timid and didn't even dare to look at the other party. [[3136 旁白 neutral]]
"She's really stupid." [[3137 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang nodded, not noticing anything unusual about Chi Xiaocheng. [[3138 旁白 neutral]]
However, there was one thing he didn't understand. [[3139 旁白 neutral]]
He turned to the bodyguard behind him and asked, "What did you see from Chi Xiaocheng?" [[3140 东方阳 neutral]]
The bodyguard paused, "She seems to be used to being bullied. She doesn't look like someone who would demand money back." [[3141 保镖 neutral]]
"Yes, her personality is very weak." Dongfang Yang stroked his chin, "But what I don't understand is, if she's so weak, why did she dare to commit such a taboo act and kidnap Su Tao?" [[3142 东方阳 neutral]]
"Ye Liang is surely much more terrifying than these bad girls, right?" [[3143 东方阳 neutral]]
He had felt something was off after he calmed down. Chi Xiaocheng's reason for sacrificing herself for Su Tao seemed a bit flimsy. [[3144 旁白 neutral]]
She acted too weak. Who gave her that impulsive courage? [[3145 旁白 neutral]]
