Chapter 224: Second Diagnosis [[19371 旁白 neutral]]
Her head felt groggy, as if she was about to fall asleep, but the moment she opened her eyes, she found her thoughts incredibly clear. [[19372 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't even know how she made it through to the morning. [[19373 旁白 neutral]]
The sky outside was dim and gray due to thunderstorms and dark clouds. If a young nurse from the hospital hadn't sent her a message, [[19374 旁白 neutral]]
she wouldn't have known it was already morning until her phone rang. [[19375 旁白 neutral]]
The room, with its curtains drawn, was completely dark. [[19376 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao got out of bed, feeling a bit tired, and rubbed her stinging eyes. Only then did she notice it was already 9:30. [[19377 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su was very busy, so she couldn't keep asking him about Chi Xiaocheng's progress. [[19378 旁白 neutral]]
So, she had added a young nurse and asked for her help to keep an eye on things. [[19379 旁白 neutral]]
Now... [[19380 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the message, and her eyes widened in an instant. [[19381 旁白 neutral]]
"Is the psychological treatment for Xiaocheng starting so soon?" [[19382 苏桃 neutral]]
She quickly threw off the covers, got out of bed, washed up, and rushed out the door with a piece of bread and a bottle of milk. [[19383 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, in the hospital room, Professor Su was holding a small notebook and said to Chi Xiaocheng, "Miss Chi, we've confirmed that your body is fine. There are some slight irregularities in your nervous system, but they aren't significant at the moment." [[19384 苏教授 neutral]]
"The instruments by the bed can be removed for now. However, regarding your diet, it's better to stick to nutritional porridge for the time being. We're not yet sure if your digestive system will have any other issues." [[19385 苏教授 neutral]]
"If you feel you can use your legs, let me know, and I can arrange some simple rehabilitation exercises for you. After all, you haven't been out of bed for a month, so your body needs to readjust." [[19386 苏教授 neutral]]
Listening to Professor Su's caring words, Chi Xiaocheng nodded obediently, "I understand, thank you, Dr. Su." [[19387 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing the slightly distant address "Dr. Su," Professor Su sighed helplessly in his heart. [[19388 旁白 neutral]]
He said, "However, there is another diagnosis today. We also need to assess your psychological condition. Two psychologists will come to ask you some questions about your daily life. You can just answer them casually." [[19389 苏教授 neutral]]
"Okay~" [[19390 池小橙 happy]]
Professor Su nodded lightly and walked out of the hospital room. [[19391 旁白 neutral]]
The diagnosis by the two psychologists was not just about confirming whether Chi Xiaocheng had psychological issues. Their main task was to determine the nature of her jumbled memories through casual conversation! [[19392 旁白 neutral]]
Which memories had she lost, and which new ones had she gained. [[19393 旁白 neutral]]
What was certain was that the timeline was after she started university, up until she was shot last month. [[19394 旁白 neutral]]
Only the memories from this semester were in disarray. [[19395 旁白 neutral]]
As for the lack of emotion and her emotional slowness, that would have to be summarized after the diagnosis. [[19396 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Chen was the first to enter. He specialized in gradually guiding the conversation through very casual dialogue, while observing the patient's expression, tone, micro-expressions, and subconscious actions to determine their specific condition. [[19397 旁白 neutral]]
Whether they were lying, if there were any special symptoms, and so on. [[19398 旁白 neutral]]
So as soon as he entered the room, Dr. Chen put on a warm smile like a spring breeze. He closed the door and the window, but pulled back the curtains. The sound of thunder was mostly blocked, and the patter of raindrops against the window created a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere. [[19399 旁白 neutral]]
Creating a world for just the two of them to increase her sense of security, while also lowering her subconscious guard. [[19400 旁白 neutral]]
Most people subconsciously dislike psychologists. [[19401 旁白 neutral]]
No one wants to admit they have psychological problems. [[19402 旁白 neutral]]
When it's time to face a psychologist, that thought has already started to form in their minds. [[19403 旁白 neutral]]
After doing all this, Dr. Chen pulled up a chair and sat by Chi Xiaocheng's bed. "We meet again, Student Chi. Do you remember me? We met at the university." [[19404 陈医生 neutral]]
"I remember." Chi Xiaocheng went along with his topic. "You and Dr. Lin were the ones who assessed me during the university's mental health event." [[19405 池小橙 neutral]]
Dr. Chen laughed heartily, as if recalling the situation. "Yes, at that time, I was assessing students one by one, and I was quite surprised when it was your turn. We have such a big age gap, but I didn't expect you to be the friend I could talk to the most." [[19406 陈医生 happy]]
After he finished speaking, he saw Chi Xiaocheng blink in confusion, "That's not right, Dr. Chen. I cut in line to be assessed by you, and it was Dongfang Yang who let me cut in." [[19407 池小橙 neutral]]
Dr. Chen rubbed his head, a bit troubled. "Is that so? It seems I'm getting old and can't remember things clearly." [[19408 陈医生 neutral]]
"Yes, and you're not old at all, Dr. Chen. You're very young." [[19409 池小橙 happy]]
"Haha, thank you for the compliment. Well then, Student Chi, do you remember that thing I told you about last time? I found the follow-up, and it's super interesting..." [[19410 陈医生 happy]]
Time passed bit by bit, and the topic was slowly guided by Dr. Chen. [[19411 旁白 neutral]]
From that interesting follow-up, he began to connect to the various things happening around Chi Xiaocheng. Dr. Chen quickly went from being a storyteller to a listener. [[19412 旁白 neutral]]
Whenever Chi Xiaocheng talked about something, he would provide plenty of emotional validation and feedback, then casually ask for more details about those things. [[19413 旁白 neutral]]
He listened to her talk about happy things and complain about things, slowly digging up her memories through conversation. [[19414 旁白 neutral]]
Throughout the whole process, Chi Xiaocheng didn't feel anything was wrong at all. [[19415 旁白 neutral]]
It was like two old friends who hadn't seen each other in a long time. [[19416 旁白 neutral]]
Although there was no alcohol, their complaints about the things around them never stopped. [[19417 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Chen timed it perfectly. It was still an hour, and when he saw that Chi Xiaocheng was tired of talking, he took the initiative to end the topic. [[19418 旁白 neutral]]
You should rest first. We can talk about the rest later. I have to go and deal with those doctors. [[19419 陈医生 neutral]]
After leaving a sentence with that meaning, Dr. Chen left the room. [[19420 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't linger. Maintaining a bit of distance and topic freshness with the patient would make the next diagnosis and treatment much easier. [[19421 旁白 neutral]]
Half an hour later, Dr. Lin took over. [[19422 旁白 neutral]]
Her questioning was more direct. Although it was also comfortable, her demeanor was more like a doctor's compared to a friend's. [[19423 旁白 neutral]]
Guiding, questioning, and occasionally throwing in a sudden topic to catch her off guard. [[19424 旁白 neutral]]
She even played a game of "truth or dare" with Chi Xiaocheng for a while. [[19425 旁白 neutral]]
Faced with a question, one had to answer without thinking within three seconds. The loser had to draw two turtles on Si Chen's face with a marker. [[19426 旁白 neutral]]
The final result, of course, was that Dr. Lin "lost." [[19427 旁白 neutral]]
But it was precisely because of the game and the chat that her jumbled memories were slowly woven together and integrated by the two doctors. [[19428 旁白 neutral]]
By noon, when Su Tao arrived at the hospital, the two of them were still in the office discussing the integrated information. [[19429 旁白 neutral]]
She asked Professor Su and was told to wait until the afternoon when Si Chen arrived to understand the situation together. [[19430 旁白 neutral]]
Another long wait. [[19431 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had already waited for a day and a night. She was desperate to know what was wrong with Chi Xiaocheng. [[19432 旁白 sad]]
To figure out how she could be treated. [[19433 旁白 sad]]
To know... if she really hated her. [[19434 苏桃 sad]]
She was right here in the hospital. Just an elevator ride and a few floors up to her room. [[19435 旁白 neutral]]
But now she was told to be mindful of her emotional state and that it was best not to see her. [[19436 旁白 neutral]]
But I've waited for a month! [[19437 苏桃 angry]]
From her death to her revival, I've been waiting for so long. I just want to see her! [[19438 苏桃 sad]]
