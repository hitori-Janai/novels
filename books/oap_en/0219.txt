Chapter 219: Amnesia? Or Lack of Emotion? [[19028 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing the sound of the hospital room door opening, Su Tao immediately stood up. [[19029 旁白 neutral]]
But it wasn't Professor Su who walked in, but Dongfang Yang, who had rushed over. [[19030 旁白 neutral]]
His hair was a bit messy from the wind, and his red coat had some dust on it. Before he even sat down, he asked Su Tao, "Su Tao, you got here even earlier than I did. I heard Chi Xiaocheng woke up. Have you seen her?" [[19031 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips, nodded slightly, and sat back down. "Xiaocheng is awake, but she's a little strange. It's like she doesn't recognize me anymore." [[19032 苏桃 sad]]
"Doesn't recognize you?" Dongfang Yang poured himself a glass of water and said in surprise, "That can't be right. You two are so close, she even sees you as a real sister." [[19033 东方阳 neutral]]
Hearing the word "sister," Su Tao felt a sting in her heart. [[19034 旁白 sad]]
Dongfang Yang said, "Could it be amnesia?" [[19035 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao froze for a moment. She hadn't considered that possibility at all. Now that Dongfang Yang mentioned it, it was like a thought flashed in her mind, but she couldn't quite grasp it. [[19036 旁白 neutral]]
She said with confusion, "She... she still remembers my name, so it probably isn't amnesia. It's just her attitude toward me... it's a bit cold." [[19037 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang frowned and touched his chin. "Well... I'm not sure about that either. Let's wait and see what Professor Su says." [[19038 东方阳 neutral]]
While the two were talking, Professor Su soon returned with a report. [[19039 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stood up and quickly asked for details. [[19040 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su sighed and said, "Let's talk about Miss Chi's physical condition first. This is good news. I thought that after lying in bed for a month, she would need at least half a month of recovery to get up. But after a full check-up, I estimate she'll be able to walk in three to five days." [[19041 苏教授 neutral]]
"The abnormally active special cells in her body have a strong healing ability." [[19042 苏教授 neutral]]
"But I don't know if it's because these strange cells focused on repairing her body, but the repair of her various neurons is very weak." [[19043 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang scratched his head and said, "Professor Su, can you please say something we can understand?" [[19044 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su looked at him speechlessly. "To put it simply, her body is mostly fine, but her intelligence, memory, thinking, and emotional abilities have been affected." [[19045 苏教授 neutral]]
"So..." Su Tao hesitated, "was Xiaocheng so cold to me just now because she's been affected in this way?" [[19046 苏桃 sad]]
"That's the initial assessment, yes." Professor Su nodded. "But this is just a preliminary check. We need to have more conversations and tests with Miss Chi to confirm exactly what the problem is." [[19047 苏教授 neutral]]
At this point, Dongfang Yang spoke up again, confused. "But wasn't Chi Xiaocheng shot just above the heart? Why would it affect her brain's nerves? I'd be more convinced if you said she was disabled rather than had amnesia." [[19048 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su rolled her eyes at Dongfang Yang. "There are so many nerves in the human body, all interconnected and influencing each other. How can anything be so certain? We all thought Miss Chi was dead, and now she's alive. I don't dare submit her amazing cells for research." [[19049 苏教授 neutral]]
"How do you want me to explain it? We can find out why, but it's more likely Miss Chi would have to be dissected." [[19050 苏教授 angry]]
Under certain extreme circumstances, not even his Dongfang family could guarantee Chi Xiaocheng's safety. [[19051 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su: "The fact is, Miss Chi survived and her body is fine. She can recover with proper nutrition, but we still need to confirm the situation with her emotions and other major functions." [[19052 苏教授 neutral]]
"I have a theory that she woke up early, before those amazing cells had time to finish their repairs. I had predicted she wouldn't wake up for another three to five months, but my observations suggested she would wake up within days." [[19053 苏教授 neutral]]
It was because of this observation that she had told Su Tao that Chi Xiaocheng might wake up in the next few days. [[19054 旁白 neutral]]
And, as it turned out, she was right. [[19055 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su noticed Su Tao's gloomy expression and added, "Look on the bright side. At least Miss Chi is awake. That's already wonderful news, isn't it?" [[19056 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang nodded in agreement beside her. "Yeah, at least she woke up." [[19057 东方阳 neutral]]
It was much better than her dying or being in a coma forever. [[19058 旁白 neutral]]
But people are greedy. When she was dead, they longed for her to live. When she was asleep, they longed for her to wake up. Now that she's awake, they long for her to be the same as before. [[19059 旁白 neutral]]
They overlooked one fact: to gain something, you must lose something. [[19060 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and forced a smile, nodding. "You're right." [[19061 苏桃 sad]]
Professor Su comforted her, "Don't lose hope. We just don't understand the principle behind those amazing cells in Miss Chi's body. If it's a psychological issue, emotional deficiency, or amnesia, we can find a way to treat it." [[19062 苏教授 neutral]]
"First, let's confirm Miss Chi's specific condition. It would be best to get a couple of psychologists to come over." [[19063 苏教授 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao's eyes lit up. "Speaking of psychologists, I know someone who is very familiar with Xiaocheng's condition. I'll ask if he can come." [[19064 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow. "In that case, I'll have Dr. Chen come too. And I'll contact Si Chen and have him bring Dr. Lin." [[19065 东方阳 neutral]]
The two psychologists who diagnosed Chi Xiaocheng at the school last time were also their own people. [[19066 旁白 neutral]]
They could be trusted. [[19067 旁白 neutral]]
They talked for a while longer. After confirming the basic situation, she asked Su Tao for a detailed account of her reactions when talking with Chi Xiaocheng. [[19068 旁白 neutral]]
After listening, Dongfang Yang touched his chin. "You two are as close as sisters, she even saw you as a real sister. She had no reaction when you said you liked her and cared about her, and was instead cold and annoyed... I have a guess." [[19069 东方阳 neutral]]
Before Dongfang Yang could share his guess, he saw Su Tao and Professor Su looking at him strangely. [[19070 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't help but ask, confused, "What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?" [[19071 东方阳 neutral]]
Theoretically, there was nothing wrong with what he said. [[19072 旁白 neutral]]
When Su Tao was describing what happened earlier, she didn't hide the fact that she had "confessed" to Chi Xiaocheng. [[19073 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't held back from saying things like "I like you, I care a lot about you" in front of Dongfang Yang. [[19074 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su knew what it meant at a glance. [[19075 旁白 neutral]]
But... Dongfang Yang still thought it was sisterly affection? [[19076 旁白 neutral]]
Well... being this innocent is also a good thing. [[19077 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su waved her hand. "It's nothing. Go on, tell us your guess." [[19078 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang said, "First, it could be a lack of emotion. Her ability to feel emotions like love, happiness, and joy has been greatly reduced, and she's heavily influenced by negative emotions, which is why she would say such cold things. But I think this possibility is low." [[19079 东方阳 neutral]]
"The more likely possibility is that she has lost some of her memories!" [[19080 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang analyzed rationally, "When a person experiences something painful, desperate, or devastating before dying, the brain will shut down certain emotions and memories to protect itself. Is it possible that..." [[19081 东方阳 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng's brain, in an act of self-preservation, has blocked certain memories or emotions related to Su Tao?" [[19082 东方阳 neutral]]
