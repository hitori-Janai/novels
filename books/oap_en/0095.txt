Chapter 95: Tao, you were wrong again this time. [[8287 旁白 neutral]]
She pulled Chi Xiaocheng into the dorm without saying a word. [[8288 旁白 neutral]]
When they entered, they saw Chen Qian getting down from her bed. "Su Tao, didn't you go for a psychological evaluation? How are you back so soon?" [[8289 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't answer Chen Qian. She pulled Chi Xiaocheng to her desk, searched through her cabinet, and asked with a puzzled tone, "I remember putting the makeup remover here. Qianqian, have you seen it?" [[8290 苏桃 neutral]]
Chen Qian looked at them, confused. "Didn't I tell you last time? I ran out, so I borrowed yours. The new one I ordered hasn't arrived yet." [[8291 陈倩 neutral]]
She pointed to their roommate who was still sleeping on the top bunk. "Xiao Wei still has some." [[8292 陈倩 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao immediately went to wake her sleeping roommate. [[8293 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian was still wondering what on earth Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao were doing. [[8294 旁白 neutral]]
She moved to the side to get a better look. Wasn't this the same Chi Xiaocheng who had looked like a monster two months ago? [[8295 旁白 neutral]]
She looked so pretty without makeup, so why did she put on such heavy makeup again! [[8296 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't understand, but when her eyes met Chi Xiaocheng's, she felt a strange shiver. [[8297 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she saw Chi Xiaocheng, with her back to Su Tao, pull a small pill out of her pocket. In an instant, Chen Qian's shock turned into a happy surprise. [[8298 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't forgotten that Chi Xiaocheng had promised two weeks ago to give her a high-tech, skin-beautifying pill if she performed well. [[8299 旁白 neutral]]
She had been thinking about the pill that gets rid of blackheads and acne for half a month! [[8300 旁白 happy]]
Giving Chi Xiaocheng a knowing look, Chen Qian asked Su Tao, who was still looking for the makeup remover, "What exactly happened?" [[8301 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao replied without turning her head, "Xiaocheng's roommates tricked her! They told her the makeup they gave her was full of harmful things that are bad for her skin!" [[8302 苏桃 angry]]
"Well..." Chen Qian hesitated for a moment, then scolded Su Tao, "You care about her so much, why didn't you keep a better eye on her? You know how naive she is." [[8303 陈倩 neutral]]
As she spoke, Chen Qian secretly gestured to the sleepy roommate who had just woken up. [[8304 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Wei was still a bit confused about the situation, but she played along with a mischievous look in her eyes, "Yeah, Taozi, this time it was your fault." [[8305 小唯 neutral]]
Su Tao paused for a moment, a hint of apology in her voice, "Yes, it's my fault. I was on my way to find Xiaocheng, but I got stopped by two people from the student council. Otherwise, this wouldn't have happened." [[8306 苏桃 sad]]
And this time, she was just lucky enough to see it. [[8307 旁白 neutral]]
Who knows what might have happened before? [[8308 旁白 neutral]]
"Found it." Su Tao breathed a sigh of relief and quickly went to Chi Xiaocheng's side, commanding, "Close your eyes first, I'll help you with this." [[8309 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng closed her eyes, but her trembling eyelashes showed how nervous she was. [[8310 旁白 neutral]]
As she felt the fingertips on her cheek, Chi Xiaocheng trusted Su Tao completely. [[8311 旁白 neutral]]
After all the makeup was removed, the delicate and fair face was revealed to Su Tao again, and she let out a sigh of relief. [[8312 旁白 neutral]]
But she also scolded her, "Xiaocheng, you too! Couldn't you tell they were tricking you? You're so pretty on your own, why would you do that to your face? It was obvious they had bad intentions. Why did you even get close to them?" [[8313 苏桃 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head, not daring to speak loudly, and just said weakly, "I'm sorry." [[8314 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao sighed and continued nagging like a mother, "I'm not trying to be annoying, but you need to learn to tell right from wrong, you know? If you keep this up, you'll get cheated... no, you've been cheated so many times before. Haven't you learned your lesson?" [[8315 苏桃 angry]]
As she continued, tears started to fall from Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[8316 旁白 neutral]]
Large teardrops rolled down her chin and dripped onto Su Tao's hand, which was resting on her leg. [[8317 旁白 neutral]]
The wet feeling surprised Su Tao. [[8318 旁白 neutral]]
She then saw Chi Xiaocheng look up with tears in her eyes, "But... but at that time, Tao-tao, you... you weren't talking to me. I had no other friends at school except for them." [[8319 池小橙 sad]]
The words caught in Su Tao's throat. [[8320 旁白 sad]]
During the summer break, she had argued with Chi Xiaocheng because of Ye Liang. [[8321 旁白 neutral]]
She was supposed to apologize, but she put it off because other things kept happening. [[8322 旁白 neutral]]
After that, Chi Xiaocheng became a completely different person, messing up all her plans with Ye Liang. [[8323 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps it was true that "sisters" like Zeng Xiuhua had taught her these things, but back then, without her, who else did Chi Xiaocheng have? [[8324 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng just looked up, crying pitifully. [[8325 旁白 sad]]
She tried her best to hide the sound of her sobs. [[8326 旁白 sad]]
As if realizing that crying wasn't good, she tried to wipe her tears with her fingers but couldn't, so she used her wrist to wipe and hide them more forcefully. [[8327 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's scolding tone completely softened. She pulled Chi Xiaocheng into her arms and said gently, "I'm sorry, Xiaocheng, my words were too harsh. You're just so innocent, and I'm just afraid you'll get hurt. It's my fault too." [[8328 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sniffled and just whimpered in response. [[8329 池小橙 sad]]
From an angle Su Tao couldn't see. [[8330 旁白 neutral]]
Her small hand quickly gestured to Chen Qian. [[8331 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian was already stunned by Chi Xiaocheng's performance. [[8332 旁白 neutral]]
She only snapped back to reality when she saw the gesture. [[8333 旁白 neutral]]
She walked over and patted Su Tao's shoulder. "Su Tao, it's rare for someone to stay so innocent. If you want Chi Xiaocheng to change, can you bear to expose her to the dark side of the world?" [[8334 陈倩 neutral]]
Their roommate, Xiao Wei, lay back down to sleep. "If you ask me, if you're worried about her, just keep an eye on her. It's that simple." [[8335 小唯 neutral]]
"Okay." [[8336 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and agreed, lost in her own thoughts. [[8337 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Chen Qian pulled her sleeping roommate up again. "Xiao Wei, what are you sleeping for? Let's go to the psychological evaluation. We can get 0.5 credits and skip an easy elective. Let's go, let's go." [[8338 陈倩 neutral]]
"Hey, wait, I haven't even changed out of my pajamas!" [[8339 小唯 neutral]]
"Why change? You were just sleeping there without reading the room. Let's go!" [[8340 陈倩 neutral]]
With a bit of pushing and pulling, Chen Qian quickly cleared the dorm room for the two of them. [[8341 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao gently pushed Chi Xiaocheng away from her embrace, took out a tissue to wipe her tears, and said softly, "Xiaocheng, don't hang out with those people anymore, okay?" [[8342 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay!" [[8343 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded obediently. Who would have thought that someone so cute could be a yandere with such an extreme side? [[8344 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao said, "Let's go get our credits from the psychologist, and then we'll go to Dongfang Yang's private hospital to have a doctor check your skin." [[8345 苏桃 neutral]]
Speaking of which, if she were in her usual yandere mode, Xiaocheng would have sided with her without any hesitation just now. [[8346 旁白 neutral]]
An image flashed through Su Tao's mind: Chi Xiaocheng hesitating with every step as she walked towards her when faced with a choice. [[8347 旁白 neutral]]
She then shook her head with a smile. [[8348 旁白 neutral]]
No, if it were that Xiaocheng, Zeng Xiuhua would probably already be in some kind of accident. [[8349 旁白 neutral]]
The yandere version of Chi Xiaocheng scared even Su Tao. [[8350 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't act out this time. Does that mean her treatment is actually working a little? [[8351 旁白 neutral]]
I'll wait for the report from this psychological evaluation and then decide what to do next. [[8352 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took Chi Xiaocheng's hand and smiled. "Let's go, Xiaocheng. The line might be long, but this evaluation is being done by Dongfang Yang and Si Chen together, so we can use our connections and skip the line." [[8353 苏桃 happy]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng narrowed her eyes. [[8354 旁白 neutral]]
This so-called "backdoor" test is the main event, isn't it? [[8355 旁白 neutral]]
Intermediate-level acting skills... I wonder if they'll be enough. [[8356 旁白 neutral]]
If the doctor really figures out that my yandere personality is just an act, things will get very difficult later on. [[8357 旁白 sad]]
