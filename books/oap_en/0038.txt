Chapter 38 Su Tao: Is Xiaocheng Really a Yandere? [[3231 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's execution was strong. Whenever she had an idea, as long as there were no other important matters hindering her, she would act on it. [[3232 旁白 neutral]]
Just like now. [[3233 旁白 neutral]]
After settling Chi Xiaocheng, she immediately took a bus. [[3234 旁白 neutral]]
The destination was her former high school. [[3235 旁白 neutral]]
More precisely, a house in a messy alley near the high school. [[3236 旁白 neutral]]
In the evening, Liu Guijia sat limping in her dilapidated small house, typing something on her phone, her face extremely grim. [[3237 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao... I'll make you pay sooner or later!" [[3238 刘桂嘉 angry]]
She gritted her teeth in hatred, then looked at the gloomy follower kneeling beside her. [[3239 旁白 neutral]]
She grabbed her hair, "You b*tch, why didn't you help me in the room just now?" [[3240 刘桂嘉 angry]]
The girl was forced to look up, her face covered in scars. She gritted her teeth, her body trembling, unable to speak. [[3241 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Liu Guijia angrily slapped her, cursing, "Useless!" [[3242 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"You're going to Qiu Li's place later, right? Remember to tell that guy to call everyone. I'm going to kill those two b*tches the day after tomorrow... no, tomorrow!" [[3243 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Her fists clenched, her knuckles cracking. [[3244 旁白 neutral]]
She had over a dozen delinquents under her, plus her two sisters. With forty or fifty people rushing over, no matter how strong Su Tao was, could she beat so many people? [[3245 旁白 neutral]]
After being slapped, the follower seemed to have gotten used to it and didn't get angry. Instead, she weakly said, "We can't beat Su Tao." [[3246 跟班 neutral]]
"Are you boosting their morale and dampening our own?" [[3247 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Liu Guijia's face twisted. She simply kicked the follower aside and stood up, angrily saying, "If Chi Xiaocheng hadn't gone crazy just now and scared me, I would have definitely fought her!" [[3248 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Just then, hurried footsteps suddenly sounded outside the door. [[3249 旁白 neutral]]
A delinquent girl in a tattered leather jacket burst in, "N-not good, boss, Su Tao's here!" [[3250 不良少女 sad]]
"What?!" [[3251 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Liu Guijia stood up with a "whoosh," but then gasped in pain as she twisted her leg. [[3252 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly asked her subordinate, "How did Su Tao get here? This place is at least an hour's drive from Jiuzhou University, right?" [[3253 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
"I don't know, sis!" The subordinate cried, "She... she seems to be here for revenge. We're all adults in college, why is she risking her life?!" [[3254 不良少女 sad]]
Liu Guijia swallowed. [[3255 旁白 neutral]]
Revenge. [[3256 旁白 neutral]]
She was here to avenge Chi Xiaocheng! [[3257 旁白 neutral]]
Run? [[3258 旁白 neutral]]
This was her home, her base. If she ran now, what would her two sisters think? [[3259 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia took a deep breath, her eyes turning fierce, "Go gather all the sisters. Su Tao is just one person. Can she really beat more than a dozen of us?" [[3260 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Today, I'm going to have a showdown with her!" [[3261 刘桂嘉 angry]]
As soon as she finished speaking, the door was gently pushed open, and a cold voice slowly sounded, "Oh? Is that so?" [[3262 苏桃 neutral]]
"Su Tao!" [[3263 报信小弟 sad]]
The subordinate who had brought the news exclaimed in surprise. After looking her up and down and seeing that she was completely unharmed, he closed his eyes and fainted. [[3264 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at the subordinate and said lightly, "Get out. I'm only here for Liu Guijia today." [[3265 苏桃 neutral]]
The fainted subordinate immediately opened his eyes wide, smiled awkwardly at Su Tao, and scrambled out the door. [[3266 旁白 neutral]]
Only Liu Guijia and her follower remained in the room. [[3267 旁白 neutral]]
The latter shrank into a corner, her bangs covering her eyes, curiously watching Su Tao. [[3268 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia, meanwhile, gritted her teeth and questioned Su Tao, "What do you mean?" [[3269 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"What, you hit Xiaocheng just now, and now you're pretending to be innocent?" [[3270 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao's face was cold. Her purpose in coming here was simple. [[3271 旁白 neutral]]
It was to get justice for Chi Xiaocheng. [[3272 旁白 neutral]]
Or, to put it more directly, revenge! [[3273 旁白 neutral]]
If it weren't for today's incident, she wouldn't even have known that Chi Xiaocheng had been bullied by this person for three years. [[3274 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems you haven't learned your lesson from high school, have you?" [[3275 苏桃 angry]]
Liu Guijia gritted her teeth, her voice resentful, "I just said, I didn't do anything to Chi Xiaocheng, at most I punched her once, I didn't do anything else!" [[3276 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Then, she pointed to her bandaged leg, "Even this, Chi Xiaocheng poked it!" [[3277 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Su Tao looked at her as if she were an idiot, "Do you think I'll believe that? I can tell at a glance that your injury was an accident when Xiaocheng resisted. Do you take me for a fool?" [[3278 苏桃 angry]]
Liu Guijia's eyes widened. [[3279 旁白 neutral]]
At the time, she was clearly the victim! [[3280 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia understood now. Su Tao didn't care about the so-called truth at all. She was here to seek revenge. [[3281 旁白 neutral]]
Could she run? [[3282 旁白 neutral]]
There was no chance! [[3283 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia took a deep breath, no longer afraid, and stood directly in front of Su Tao, saying in a deep voice, "Since that's the case, let's settle this. Don't think I'm really afraid of you!" [[3284 刘桂嘉 angry]]
After Liu Guijia finished speaking, she suddenly lowered her waist. [[3285 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't think I'm still that ignorant delinquent from high school. I've learned a few moves from my brother who's in the underworld. Su Tao, just die!" [[3286 刘桂嘉 angry]]
She immediately performed a set of military boxing in place. [[3287 旁白 neutral]]
It was truly powerful and imposing. [[3288 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, die for me!" [[3289 刘桂嘉 angry]]
She took a step forward! [[3290 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang—!" [[3291 旁白 neutral]]
Then she was knocked down by Su Tao's punch. [[3292 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia covered her face and squatted on the ground, her head buzzing. [[3293 旁白 neutral]]
"That's it?" [[3294 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao grabbed her sleeve and pulled her up, "You've been messing around for three years in high school, and you're still in this dilapidated place in college. If it weren't for today's incident, I wouldn't have known you've been bullying Xiaocheng for so long!" [[3295 苏桃 angry]]
Liu Guijia said aggrievedly, "Before, it was fine, but today she was clearly bullying me!" [[3296 刘桂嘉 sad]]
"Still stubborn?" [[3297 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao didn't hold back and immediately launched a combination of punches. [[3298 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia was completely beaten to tears. [[3299 旁白 neutral]]
Her yellow hair was already dirty. She cried out loudly, "I told you, you don't believe me. If I don't say anything, you'll think I'm stubborn. What can I do? At first, she asked me for money, and I didn't want to give it to her, so I punched her. Who knew she would suddenly go crazy!" [[3300 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Liu Guijia was also scared of being beaten. She said whatever came to mind, her voice choked with grievance, "She kept saying she was the victim, and then something about being a yandere. I felt like she was going to kill me at the time. Why don't you believe me?!" [[3301 刘桂嘉 sad]]
At this moment, where was her earlier spiritedness? [[3302 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao, indeed, stopped at these words. [[3303 旁白 neutral]]
She frowned deeply, her face puzzled, "You just said Xiaocheng mentioned something about a yandere?" [[3304 苏桃 neutral]]
Liu Guijia wiped away a tear and nodded, "She was on top of me, playing with that knife and talking to herself. You don't believe me when I tell you, and you keep beating me and telling me to tell the truth. Are you even human?!" [[3305 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Su Tao scratched her cheek, a hint of guilt instinctively flashing in her heart. [[3306 旁白 neutral]]
But then she thought, this person is utterly evil, she doesn't need to feel guilty at all. [[3307 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, there was something more important. [[3308 旁白 neutral]]
So she grabbed her by the collar and said fiercely, "Tell me everything that happened in that room, from beginning to end!" [[3309 苏桃 angry]]
Xiaocheng was a yandere, she knew that. [[3310 旁白 neutral]]
But what puzzled her was why Chi Xiaocheng would actively mention the word "yandere"? [[3311 旁白 neutral]]
If she herself was aware of what a yandere was, could she still be one? [[3312 旁白 neutral]]
She vaguely felt that what happened to Chi Xiaocheng was far more complicated than she had imagined. [[3313 旁白 neutral]]
