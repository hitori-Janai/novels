Chapter 98: Mild Schizophrenia [[8501 旁白 neutral]]
"Acting?" [[8502 苏桃 neutral]]
Everyone except Doctor Lin looked at Doctor Chen. [[8503 旁白 neutral]]
The latter pushed up her glasses, nodded, and said, "Of course, it's just a feeling. I can't make a final conclusion. Psychologists like Doctor Lin and me, who are quite specialized, have our own diagnostic methods." [[8504 陈医生 neutral]]
Doctor Chen said, "When I'm with a patient, I'm more used to guiding the conversation toward topics they care about most, chatting like a friend to get them to relax their subconscious self-protection. Then I analyze the patient based on their language, micro-expressions, and actions." [[8505 陈医生 neutral]]
Doctor Lin nodded. "Yes, I personally prefer a more aggressive approach of probing, using lies and indirect questions to bypass the patient's guarded answers in order to analyze their deepest thoughts." [[8506 林医生 neutral]]
Doctor Chen continued, "It's through this past hour of chatting that I feel Miss Chi is a very contradictory person, especially when Miss Su was mentioned." [[8507 陈医生 neutral]]
"I guided the conversation and mentioned something like, 'Miss Chi, you and Miss Su seem to have a really good relationship.' At that moment, she gave me three completely different, contradictory reactions." [[8508 陈医生 neutral]]
"The first was desire, or you could say admiration. A desire to become someone like Miss Su, or to have someone like Miss Su." [[8509 陈医生 neutral]]
"The second was a calmness she deliberately showed. I'm certain she was acting, playing the part of a normal friend to hide the first reaction of desire and admiration." [[8510 陈医生 neutral]]
"I'm not sure what the third, deeper emotion was. Her emotional state was a bit unstable, so I couldn't probe deeper. But if I were to explain it using three personalities..." [[8511 陈医生 neutral]]
"The first is the 'self' personality." [[8512 陈医生 neutral]]
"The second is the 'surface' personality." [[8513 陈医生 neutral]]
"And the third is the 'hidden' personality." [[8514 陈医生 neutral]]
"She uses the surface personality to hide her self personality, but she hasn't realized there's also a hidden personality." [[8515 陈医生 neutral]]
Doctor Chen pushed up her glasses. "Of course, this is just a hypothesis to help you all understand better. She doesn't really have three personalities. The reason I said she gives me a very contradictory feeling is because of this." [[8516 陈医生 neutral]]
"Her high stress comes from unease and anxiety. As for why she's uneasy and what she's anxious about, before getting to know her more deeply, some of you here might know more than I do." [[8517 陈医生 neutral]]
After she finished speaking, Doctor Chen took a small step back, indicating that she had finished presenting the main points of her diagnosis. [[8518 旁白 neutral]]
Any other noteworthy but less critical details would be included in the diagnostic report later. [[8519 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked completely confused. [[8520 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao and Si Chen could understand some of it. [[8521 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Chen and Dongfang Yang didn't know that Chi Xiaocheng was a yandere. [[8522 旁白 neutral]]
In Su Tao's eyes, Chi Xiaocheng's so-called 'hidden personality' was just her yandere side. [[8523 旁白 neutral]]
She herself didn't know she was a yandere and only showed a normal front to the world. Only when Su Tao was mentioned did her yandere side appear. [[8524 旁白 neutral]]
In her opinion, Doctor Chen's diagnosis was mostly correct. She only came up with the 'three personalities' theory due to a lack of information. [[8525 旁白 neutral]]
As for acting like someone else, that was just a misjudgment caused by the split between her normal and yandere states. [[8526 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at Si Chen beside her. [[8527 旁白 neutral]]
She noticed that the man, who also wore glasses and had studied psychology, was deep in thought. [[8528 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at Doctor Lin. "Doctor Lin, what do you think?" [[8529 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Lin turned to get her notes from the table, using the brief moment her back was to the others to glance at Si Chen. [[8530 旁白 neutral]]
After noticing Si Chen's gaze, she had an idea of what to say. [[8531 旁白 neutral]]
She turned back with her notes and began, "I don't entirely agree with Doctor Chen's view." [[8532 林医生 neutral]]
Both Dongfang Yang and Su Tao were a bit surprised. [[8533 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Lin flipped through her notes. "I did sense the contradiction Doctor Chen mentioned, but the conclusion that she is 'acting' as someone is too subjective and a result of Doctor Chen's diagnostic method." [[8534 林医生 neutral]]
"The source of Miss Chi's contradiction lies mainly with Miss Su." [[8535 林医生 neutral]]
"During the diagnosis, I asked her about her history with Miss Su. From childhood, to middle and high school, and now in college, Miss Chi has had no friends other than Miss Su." [[8536 林医生 neutral]]
"Combined with her past experiences of being bullied, this is the long-term source of her anxiety." [[8537 林医生 neutral]]
"And a while ago, their relationship became strained because of an argument. The contradiction appeared during this period." [[8538 林医生 neutral]]
"On one hand, she cares deeply for Miss Su, seeing her as family, or even more important than family. On the other hand, she's afraid that she'll do something too extreme that will make Miss Su unhappy and cause her to be abandoned." [[8539 林医生 neutral]]
"It's like how a child acts according to their parents' wishes to make them happy. On the surface, they pretend to be a good child to receive praise, but underneath, they are a completely different person." [[8540 林医生 neutral]]
Her words were met with approval from everyone present. [[8541 旁白 neutral]]
Even Doctor Chen nodded thoughtfully. "I indeed wasn't aware of the things that happened between them." [[8542 陈医生 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at Doctor Lin. "So, is that the reason Xiaocheng is acting so... contradictory?" [[8543 苏桃 neutral]]
Her question had a hidden meaning. [[8544 旁白 neutral]]
It was directed at Doctor Lin, who knew the inside story. [[8545 旁白 neutral]]
Could Xiaocheng have become a yandere just because of that? [[8546 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, Doctor Lin stated her theory, "I personally think that Miss Chi might have mild schizophrenia." [[8547 林医生 neutral]]
"Wait a minute..." Dongfang Yang was beyond confused. He held his forehead, trying to process it. "First it was three personalities, and now it's schizophrenia?" [[8548 东方阳 sad]]
Si Chen commented dryly from the side, "The 'three personalities' was a hypothesis to help you understand. The schizophrenia is 'mild'. If you're not going to use your brain, then don't interrupt." [[8549 司辰 angry]]
Dongfang Yang glared at Si Chen. "What, you understand it all?" [[8550 东方阳 angry]]
Si Chen calmly pushed up his glasses. "I also studied psychology, and Doctor Lin even mentored me for a while." [[8551 司辰 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was speechless for a moment and looked expectantly at Su Tao. "Su Tao, I..." [[8552 东方阳 sad]]
Su Tao's mind was completely focused on what Doctor Lin had said about schizophrenia. "Dongfang Yang, if you don't understand, why don't you go take a rest?" [[8553 苏桃 angry]]
Dongfang Yang's face froze. [[8554 旁白 neutral]]
He squatted in a corner, feeling wronged and drawing circles on the ground. [[8555 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Lin continued, "As Doctor Chen said, her mental state isn't stable. Society, family, and her environment are all putting constant pressure on her." [[8556 林医生 neutral]]
She then looked at Su Tao. "Has she experienced any major trauma recently?" [[8557 林医生 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded lightly. "Yes." [[8558 苏桃 sad]]
It was that time in the basement. [[8559 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Lin looked at everyone and gave a deep analysis based on this recent trauma. [[8560 旁白 neutral]]
Her words made even Doctor Chen nod in agreement. "Doctor Lin's analysis is reasonable." [[8561 陈医生 neutral]]
Doctor Lin added, "However, this also includes some of my own subjective guesses. If possible, it would be best to have a few more opportunities for us to interact with Miss Chi." [[8562 林医生 neutral]]
The initial treatment methods, therapy sessions, and medication support would all be detailed in the upcoming diagnostic report. [[8563 旁白 neutral]]
After saying goodbye, Su Tao immediately went to an office where she had arranged to meet Si Chen. [[8564 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Lin and he were already waiting for her. [[8565 旁白 neutral]]
They had to put on a show for Dongfang Yang, so Doctor Chen was handling the 'normal' psychological diagnosis. [[8566 旁白 neutral]]
But Doctor Lin's diagnosis was specifically focused on Chi Xiaocheng's yandere tendencies! [[8567 旁白 neutral]]
This was what Su Tao had arranged with them beforehand. [[8568 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as she entered, Su Tao anxiously asked, "Doctor Lin, how is she? Is the schizophrenia for real? Is Xiaocheng really a yandere? Is there still any hope for treatment?" [[8569 苏桃 sad]]
Her face was filled with anxiety. [[8570 旁白 neutral]]
