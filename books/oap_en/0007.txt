Chapter 7: Meeting the Male Lead [[556 旁白 neutral]]
Although the original owner was jealous, her jealousy was only directed at Su Tao. [[557 旁白 neutral]]
Among the first-year students and in her class, the original owner was actually quite popular. [[558 旁白 neutral]]
Basically, anyone who gave her a few compliments could easily become her friend. [[559 旁白 neutral]]
She had few female friends. [[560 旁白 neutral]]
But she had many male admirers. [[561 旁白 neutral]]
She posted a tired-looking, makeup-free photo with a long caption full of apologies. The repeated words made it seem like she must have gone through something terrible. [[562 旁白 neutral]]
Comments showing concern and confusion started to appear under her post. [[563 旁白 neutral]]
You Ge: "Xiaocheng, are you okay? Are you sick? Why do you keep apologizing? Did someone upset you?" [[564 佑哥 neutral]]
Huahua Junzi: "Who's in the picture you posted, Xiaocheng? So cute." [[565 花花君子 neutral]]
Wants to be Xiaocheng's dog: "This is your makeup-free photo, right, Xiaocheng? You look a bit pale, but so beautiful. Why do you even wear makeup? It just hides your real beauty!" [[566 想当小橙的狗 neutral]]
Xiu Hua replied to Wants to be Xiaocheng's dog: "What do you mean, 'makeup makes her look worse'? You stupid man, do you have any idea about the beauty of makeup on a girl? If you don't understand, you shouldn't be commenting here. And that username is disgusting." [[567 秀花 angry]]
Xiu Hua @Chi Xiaocheng: "Chengcheng, ignore them. A girl's confidence comes from beautiful makeup. You look so much worse now compared to when you're wearing it. Did something happen? You can tell me." [[568 秀花 neutral]]
Yang: "Heh, if that's Chi Xiaocheng, I'll eat my hat. It's obviously heavily edited with filters!" [[569 阳 angry]]
Seeing this skeptical comment, Chi Xiaocheng didn't get angry. [[570 旁白 neutral]]
Influenced by her friends, the original owner almost always wore makeup, whether she was posting on social media or going out in public. [[571 旁白 neutral]]
She looked like a different person without makeup, so it was natural for people to be skeptical. [[572 旁白 neutral]]
However, that person with the ID "Xiu Hua"... [[573 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's expression turned icy. [[574 旁白 neutral]]
This person was one of the original owner's three so-called best friends. They had known each other since high school and ended up as roommates after getting into Jiuzhou University together. [[575 旁白 neutral]]
She constantly praised and flattered the original owner, pretending to care while actually causing her all sorts of anxiety. This friend was a major reason the original owner was so hostile towards Su Tao. [[576 旁白 neutral]]
The key thing was that the original owner was foolish enough to believe these friends! [[577 旁白 neutral]]
"I just got here, but I'll settle these scores one by one." [[578 池小橙 angry]]
After resting, Chi Xiaocheng took out a piece of paper and began to map out her plan. [[579 旁白 neutral]]
First, she had to get on Su Tao's good side before the male leads came looking for her. [[580 旁白 neutral]]
That way, if she got into trouble, she could rely on Su Tao to help. [[581 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking from another perspective, if she were Su Tao, and her childhood friend, who she thought had turned dark and hated her for over two years, suddenly turned out to actually be in love with her... [[582 旁白 neutral]]
But that love had turned into hate. [[583 旁白 neutral]]
What would you do when you realized someone you always cared about had become a yandere because of you? [[584 旁白 neutral]]
"I'd ask the people around me for advice!" [[585 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wrote it down. [[586 旁白 neutral]]
Putting herself in Su Tao's shoes and considering her personality, she knew that Su Tao would definitely seek support when she felt lost. [[587 旁白 neutral]]
"And she wouldn't go to the male leads, because this is about me." [[588 池小橙 neutral]]
The male leads already hated her; asking them about it would only make things worse. [[589 旁白 neutral]]
Because of her actions, Su Tao hadn't despaired and lost all sympathy for "Chi Xiaocheng" as she did in the original story, where she let the male leads kick her out of the picture. [[590 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she was left feeling confused and uncertain! [[591 旁白 neutral]]
"So, according to the original story's plot, besides me, Su Tao's other good friends are..." [[592 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned, a little troubled. [[593 旁白 neutral]]
She had never actually read the book in her past life; she only knew about it because it was so popular. [[594 旁白 neutral]]
She had just come across some AI-narrated novel videos from time to time and heard bits and pieces. [[595 旁白 neutral]]
She only knew parts of the plot, not the detailed story. [[596 旁白 neutral]]
"System, do something useful. Don't be so useless." [[597 池小橙 angry]]
Helpless, she could only place her hopes on this snarky System. [[598 旁白 neutral]]
The System replied very professionally. [[599 旁白 neutral]]
[I recommend the host use Emotion Points to purchase the novel "From Sidekick to Center Stage: Winning Over the Male Leads." Each chapter costs 5 Emotion Points, which will allow you to understand the plot's direction.] [[600 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly typed a question mark. "I ask you for a tip, and you give me this hardcore solution?" [[601 池小橙 angry]]
"And it's 5 Emotion Points for one chapter? That's a ripoff!" [[602 池小橙 angry]]
She only had a dozen or so points left. Maybe because of her social media post, she had gained a few more during her hour of rest. [[603 旁白 neutral]]
"Can I see the novel's table of contents first?" [[604 池小橙 neutral]]
[Yes.] [[605 系统 neutral]]
Using the system panel, Chi Xiaocheng quickly scrolled to around Chapter 100 of the novel. [[606 旁白 neutral]]
Sure enough, in Chapter 150, she saw the chapter title—"The Death of Chi Xiaocheng." [[607 旁白 sad]]
"Survival is my top priority. And I need to insert myself into the later plot to make the other characters feel emotions towards me. I should buy as many of the later chapters as I can!" [[608 池小橙 neutral]]
But who could she get Emotion Points from now? [[609 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought about the novel's characters, and her eyes gradually settled on the user ID "Yang," who had just replied to her post. [[610 旁白 neutral]]
One of the novel's many male leads—Dongfang Yang. [[611 旁白 neutral]]
In the original owner's memory, this person was the male lead who had the least involvement with her so far. [[612 旁白 neutral]]
"He said he'd 'eat three pounds of sh*t' if it was my real face?" [[613 池小橙 neutral]]
"I wonder if a rich boy like him will keep his promise." [[614 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened WeChat and sent him a message: "Are you there?" [[615 池小橙 neutral]]
Watch and learn. This is a masterclass. [[616 旁白 neutral]]
Yang: "Chi Xiaocheng, you dare to contact me?" [[617 阳 angry]]
Apparently, he already knew that the original owner had imprisoned Su Tao. [[618 旁白 neutral]]
His location at that moment was a private hospital. [[619 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wanted to send a voice message to take advantage of her cute voice, but then she remembered his favorability toward her was negative, so even the best voice would only backfire. [[620 旁白 neutral]]
So she typed, "I'm sorry. I now understand that I was wrong! I already told Su Tao that I won't bother you anymore. I just wanted to apologize to you one last time." [[621 池小橙 sad]]
"I really realize I was wrong!" [[622 池小橙 sad]]
The yandere personality wouldn't work on these male leads. [[623 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang replied coldly: "Heh, so you're going to stop liking me and bothering me from today onwards, is that it?" [[624 阳 angry]]
Although it hadn't been many times, the original owner had confessed her feelings to Dongfang Yang a few times. [[625 旁白 neutral]]
Without exception. [[626 旁白 neutral]]
She was rejected every time. [[627 旁白 neutral]]
And because of her attitude towards Su Tao, Dongfang Yang disliked her more and more. [[628 旁白 neutral]]
Speaking of Dongfang Yang, among the many male leads, he was one of the less successful ones. [[629 旁白 neutral]]
At first, he treated the female lead like a younger sister, but he was gradually influenced by Su Tao's main character aura. With his white moonlight's powerful charm, he joined the fierce competition among the male leads. [[630 旁白 neutral]]
His affection for Su Tao hadn't yet reached the point of unwavering devotion, which was why Chi Xiaocheng chose to approach him first. [[631 旁白 neutral]]
She thought for a moment and then typed a green-tea-like message: "I'm really sorry. After Su Tao talked to me in the basement, I truly realized I was wrong. Besides, you would never like someone like me anyway. It was my fault for not knowing my place and bothering you." [[632 池小橙 sad]]
The word "basement" clearly piqued Dongfang Yang's interest. [[633 旁白 neutral]]
Two messages arrived one after another. [[634 旁白 neutral]]
"It's good that you understand. A person like you shouldn't be daydreaming. I could never fall for someone like you in my entire life." [[635 阳 angry]]
"Meet me at the Bamboo Cafe on campus. You have to tell me exactly what happened in the basement, every single detail!" [[636 阳 angry]]
