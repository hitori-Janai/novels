Chapter 7: Meeting the Male Lead [[2]]
The original owner was jealous, but only towards Su Tao. [[3]]
The original owner was actually quite popular with the freshmen and her classmates. [[4]]
It was easy to become her friend; you just had to give her a few compliments. [[5]]
She didn't have many female friends, [[6]]
but she had plenty of male admirers. [[7]]
She posted a tired-looking photo of herself without makeup. The long, apologetic caption made everyone think she must be going through something difficult. [[8]]
Comments showing concern and confusion started to appear under her post. [[9]]
You Ge: "Xiaocheng, are you okay? Are you sick? Why do you keep saying sorry? Did someone upset you?" [[10]]
Flowery Gentleman: "Who is in the picture Xiaocheng posted? So cute." [[11]]
Wannabe Xiaocheng's Dog: "This is a photo of Xiaocheng without makeup, right? She looks a little pale, but she's so beautiful. Why does she even wear makeup? It makes her less pretty!" [[12]]
Xiu Hua replied to Wannabe Xiaocheng's Dog: "What do you mean makeup makes her look worse? You silly man, you don't get why girls wear makeup. If you don't understand, you shouldn't be commenting. Besides, that username of yours is just gross." [[13]]
Xiu Hua tagged @Chi Xiaocheng: "Chengcheng, don't listen to them. Beautiful makeup gives a girl confidence. You look much worse now than you do with makeup on. Did something happen? You can tell me." [[14]]
Yang: "Yeah, right. If that's Chi Xiaocheng, I'll eat my shoe. It's obviously heavily photoshopped and filtered!" [[15]]
Seeing this comment, Chi Xiaocheng didn't get angry. [[16]]
Influenced by her "friends," the original owner almost always wore makeup, whether she was posting on social media or going out in public. [[17]]
Without it, she looked like a different person, so it was natural for people to doubt it was her. [[18]]
However, that person with the username "Xiu Hua"... [[19]]
Chi Xiaocheng's expression turned ice-cold. [[20]]
This person was one of the original owner's three main "friends." They had known each other since high school, got into Jiuzhou University together, and were even roommates. [[21]]
She was always praising the original owner, but she was actually creating anxiety for her. This "friend" was a big reason why the original owner was so hostile towards Su Tao. [[22]]
The worst part was that the original owner was naive enough to believe her "friends"! [[23]]
Now that I've taken over, I'll have to settle these scores one by one. [[24]]
After resting, Chi Xiaocheng took out a piece of paper and started to think about her next move. [[25]]
First, she had to get on Su Tao's good side before the male leads came after her. [[26]]
That way, if she got into trouble, she could rely on Su Tao for help. [[27]]
Thinking from another perspective, if I were Su Tao, and my childhood friend who had targeted me for two years suddenly revealed she was actually in love with me... [[28]]
But her love had turned into hate. [[29]]
What would you do when someone you always cared about became obsessive because of you? [[30]]
"Ask people around you for advice!" [[31]]
Chi Xiaocheng wrote it down. [[32]]
Putting herself in Su Tao's shoes, she realized Su Tao would definitely look for support when she felt lost. [[33]]
"And she won't go to the male leads, because this is about me." [[34]]
The male leads already hated her; asking them would only make things worse. [[35]]
Because of her actions, Su Tao didn't feel hopeless about "Chi Xiaocheng" like in the original story, letting the male leads kick her out of the competition. [[36]]
Instead, she was just confused! [[37]]
"So, according to the original story, besides me, Su Tao's other good friends are..." [[38]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned, a little troubled. [[39]]
She had never actually read the book in her past life; it was just so popular. [[40]]
She had only heard bits and pieces from AI-generated videos about the novel. [[41]]
She only knew the general plot, not the specific details. [[42]]
"System, do something useful. Don't be so useless." [[43]]
Helpless, she could only place her hopes on her snarky cheat system. [[44]]
The System replied very professionally. [[45]]
[Recommended: Host can use Emotion Points to purchase the novel "From Sidekick to Center Stage: Winning Over the Male Leads." 5 Emotion Points can buy 1 chapter, allowing you to understand the plot.] [[46]]
Chi Xiaocheng was speechless. "I ask you for a little help, and you give me this hardcore solution?" [[47]]
"And it costs 5 Emotion Points for one chapter? That's a ripoff!" [[48]]
She only had about a dozen points left, though she had gained a few in the last hour, probably from her social media post. [[49]]
"Can I see the table of contents for this novel first?" [[50]]
[Yes.] [[51]]
Using the System panel, Chi Xiaocheng quickly scrolled to around chapter 100. [[52]]
As expected, at chapter 150, she saw the title—"The Death of Chi Xiaocheng." [[53]]
"Surviving is my main goal. And I need to get into the later parts of the story and make other characters have emotional reactions to me. I need to buy as many of the later chapters as I can!" [[54]]
But who could she get Emotion Points from right now? [[55]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought about the characters in the novel, and her eyes landed on the username "Yang," who had just replied to her post. [[56]]
One of the many male leads in the novel—Dongfang Yang. [[57]]
In the original owner's memory, this person had the least connection to her among all the male leads introduced so far. [[58]]
"He'd eat three pounds of crap if that was me without makeup?" [[59]]
"I wonder if a rich boy like him will keep his promise." [[60]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened her chat and sent him a message, "Are you there?" [[61]]
Watch and learn. This is a masterclass. [[62]]
Yang: "Chi Xiaocheng, you have the nerve to contact me?" [[63]]
Apparently, he already knew that the original owner had trapped Su Tao. [[64]]
His location at that moment was a private hospital. [[65]]
Chi Xiaocheng wanted to use her cute, girly voice to her advantage, but then she remembered his favorability towards her was negative. A nice voice would only make it worse. [[66]]
So, she typed, "I'm sorry, I now understand that I was wrong! I already told Su Tao that I won't bother you anymore. I just wanted to apologize to you one last time." [[67]]
"I truly realize I was wrong!" [[68]]
The obsessive personality wouldn't work on these male leads. [[69]]
Dongfang Yang replied coldly, "Heh, so starting today you won't like me anymore, and you won't bother me again, is that it?" [[70]]
Although it hadn't been many times, the original owner had confessed her feelings to Dongfang Yang a few times. [[71]]
Without exception, [[72]]
she was rejected every time. [[73]]
And because of how she treated Su Tao, Dongfang Yang disliked her more and more. [[74]]
Speaking of Dongfang Yang, he was one of the less successful male leads. [[75]]
At first, he treated the female lead like a little sister. But influenced by Su Tao's charm, he eventually joined the intense competition for her. [[76]]
His feelings for Su Tao weren't at a die-hard level yet, which is why Chi Xiaocheng contacted him first. [[77]]
She thought for a moment and then typed a message with a hint of green tea bitterness, "I'm so sorry. After Su Tao talked to me in the basement, I realized I was wrong. Besides, you would never like someone like me anyway. I didn't know my place before, and I'm sorry for bothering you." [[78]]
The word "basement" clearly caught Dongfang Yang's interest. [[79]]
Two messages arrived one after the other. [[80]]
"It's good that you understand. Someone like you shouldn't be daydreaming. I would never be interested in a person like you." [[81]]
"Meet me at the Bamboo Cafe on campus. You have to tell me everything that happened in that basement!" [[82]]
