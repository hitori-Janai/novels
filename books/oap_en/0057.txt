Chapter 57 Chi Xiaocheng's Three-Step Plan [[5009 旁白 neutral]]
One finger. [[5010 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing this, not only Si Chen, but even the system felt it was a bit too much. [[5011 旁白 neutral]]
It couldn't help but ask worriedly. [[5012 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, Si Chen is still a young master. Even if he's down and out, his influence is not small to us. If he chooses to side with Ye Liang, wouldn't it backfire?] [[5013 系统 neutral]]
[You're a bit too impulsive.] [[5014 系统 neutral]]
"No, I'm very rational." The eerie red in Chi Xiaocheng's pupils did not diminish, "Si Chen is too dangerous. I'm testing whether he's trustworthy." [[5015 池小橙 neutral]]
"If he cuts off his finger without hesitation, it means he can do anything to achieve his goal, even harm himself. Such a person, for profit, will definitely betray me. Si Chen cannot be kept!" [[5016 池小橙 neutral]]
"If he gives up, it means Si Chen is weak and incompetent, unable to withstand tests. He will betray me with a little torture. Si Chen cannot be kept!" [[5017 池小橙 neutral]]
"If he uses someone else's hand to replace his own, it means he is cold-blooded and inhumane. Si Chen cannot be kept!" [[5018 池小橙 neutral]]
If such a person is placed next to Su Tao, will he be her inside man, or will he become someone else's inside man in the future? [[5019 旁白 neutral]]
The male leads in female-oriented novels are not to be trifled with. [[5020 旁白 neutral]]
If Si Chen found out that she wasn't a yandere, would he still choose to side with her instead of Su Tao? [[5021 旁白 neutral]]
Pressure must be applied! [[5022 旁白 neutral]]
And Si Chen also felt the pressure from Chi Xiaocheng. Holding his phone, he felt a chill rush to his head, and his scalp tingled! [[5023 旁白 neutral]]
He had witnessed the ruthlessness of a yandere. [[5024 旁白 neutral]]
He repeatedly warned himself to control the extent of his interaction with the yandere. [[5025 旁白 neutral]]
But he still didn't expect Chi Xiaocheng to be so vengeful! [[5026 旁白 neutral]]
His finger... he himself felt scared. [[5027 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao's mysterious old man was the only help he had found in years! [[5028 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen glanced at the fruit knife on the table, then took a deep breath. [[5029 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng, can I apologize in a different way?" [[5030 司辰 neutral]]
The scar on his face was already enough of a problem for him. He couldn't accept losing another finger. [[5031 旁白 neutral]]
So he said to Chi Xiaocheng, "I can carve words on my back with a knife, and I'll definitely keep my distance from Su Tao from now on. This is truly, truly the last time!" [[5032 司辰 neutral]]
It seemed that without shedding some blood, this yandere Chi Xiaocheng couldn't be appeased. [[5033 旁白 neutral]]
The little thought of controlling Chi Xiaocheng through Su Tao, which had just arisen, also vanished without a trace. [[5034 旁白 neutral]]
One accident could lead to losing everything! [[5035 旁白 neutral]]
The yandere's actions were too unpredictable. [[5036 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's suggestion was unexpected by Chi Xiaocheng, but she still agreed. She was weak and isolated, and the help of this male lead was indeed indispensable. [[5037 旁白 neutral]]
After hanging up the phone, Si Chen sat on the chair and let out a long sigh. [[5038 旁白 neutral]]
He knocked on the table, and a bodyguard entered, "Young Master, what are your orders?" [[5039 保镖 neutral]]
"Help me write a few words on my back." [[5040 司辰 neutral]]
The bodyguard was stunned for a moment, then turned to leave, "Okay, Young Master, I'll go get a pen." [[5041 保镖 neutral]]
"No need." Si Chen pointed to the small knife on the table, "Just carve it with a knife. You can use some force, I can bear it." [[5042 司辰 neutral]]
The bodyguard's face twitched, and he tremblingly picked up the small knife. [[5043 旁白 neutral]]
He wouldn't be thrown into the river for carving words, would he? [[5044 旁白 neutral]]
After much hesitation, the bodyguard still asked, "Young Master, do you really want to carve it? It will hurt a lot." [[5045 保镖 neutral]]
Si Chen unbuttoned his shirt and replied, "Don't worry, I won't blame you." [[5046 司辰 neutral]]
Bodyguard: "Then... serve the country faithfully?" [[5047 保镖 neutral]]
Si Chen: "..." [[5048 旁白 neutral]]
He glanced at the bodyguard faintly, and after a long silence, he said decisively, "Never love Tao. Just these four words." [[5049 司辰 neutral]]
He had been in contact with Su Tao for about three months, and he actually had a good impression of this cheerful and beautiful girl. [[5050 旁白 neutral]]
But for that position, this little affection could only be personally erased by him! [[5051 旁白 neutral]]
His resolve turned into determination. Si Chen grabbed the corner of the table and shouted to embolden himself, "Come on!" [[5052 司辰 neutral]]
Before long, a pig-like scream came from the office. [[5053 旁白 neutral]]
Later, a rumor spread from unknown sources—it was said that Young Master Si Chen was gay and had an office romance with a group of bodyguards in suits! [[5054 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, these were all later stories. [[5055 旁白 neutral]]
After dismissing Si Chen, Chi Xiaocheng looked at her room again. [[5056 旁白 neutral]]
Today was the last day. Tomorrow, Su Tao's leave from various places would end. [[5057 旁白 neutral]]
After disappearing for three days, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't let her stay at her house any longer, no matter what. [[5058 旁白 neutral]]
In the evening, it was time to end this beautiful time. [[5059 旁白 neutral]]
"Reluctant, somehow." [[5060 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked towards the room, sighing inwardly. [[5061 旁白 neutral]]
She thought, how wonderful it would be if it could always be like this, being confined in a small room with Su Tao, leaning on each other for a lifetime. [[5062 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, your goal hasn't been achieved yet, has it? Is half a day enough?] [[5063 系统 neutral]]
"Barely." [[5064 池小橙 neutral]]
In Chi Xiaocheng's plan, the first step was to change Su Tao's mindset. [[5065 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't have the idea of treating the yandere and turning her back into the good sister she was when she was little. If that idea persisted, that feeling would never turn into love. [[5066 旁白 neutral]]
Currently, this step was almost complete. [[5067 旁白 neutral]]
Once she, as Doctor Cheng, subtly guided her, treating the yandere would turn into enjoying the yandere. [[5068 旁白 neutral]]
And the second step, naturally, was to make Su Tao not resist her. [[5069 旁白 neutral]]
From the change in taste of food to her being the only one. [[5070 旁白 neutral]]
Undoubtedly, this step was the most successful. [[5071 旁白 neutral]]
The blurring of external time, the oppressive space, and the extremely distorted feeding. Two days outside probably felt like a week to Su Tao. [[5072 旁白 neutral]]
Everything she encountered was under Chi Xiaocheng's deliberate guidance. [[5073 旁白 neutral]]
The food looked fresh, but it was actually rotten, coupled with the oppression brought by her yandere transformation. [[5074 旁白 neutral]]
Nothing around her was normal. [[5075 旁白 neutral]]
Such a Tao Tao, when tense, would find it difficult to think, and would instinctively grasp Chi Xiaocheng as her last straw. [[5076 旁白 neutral]]
After three days, coupled with Chi Xiaocheng's active and forceful treatment, there had been dozens of sessions of varying lengths. [[5077 旁白 neutral]]
And after Su Tao stopped resisting her, it was time for the final step of the plan. [[5078 旁白 neutral]]
To make her develop romantic feelings for her! [[5079 旁白 neutral]]
Spending three days in torment to fall in love with someone was a wild fantasy, so Chi Xiaocheng set her goals very low. [[5080 旁白 neutral]]
As long as Su Tao was conflicted and had a good impression of her, that would be enough. [[5081 旁白 neutral]]
Now, it was time to carry out this step in the last half day. [[5082 旁白 neutral]]
Then, naturally, let her out. [[5083 旁白 neutral]]
As she planned this in her mind, Chi Xiaocheng opened the door, only to see Su Tao standing by the door, looking guilty and startled. [[5084 旁白 neutral]]
She was eavesdropping. [[5085 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, the room's soundproofing was excellent. [[5086 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled faintly, "Tao Tao, what are you doing?" [[5087 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly took a step back, guiltily shifting her gaze away, "N-nothing, I was just wondering when you'd be back." [[5088 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't expose her lie, but instead happily took her hand, "Tao Tao, do you like me that much? You were looking at me with such scared eyes just now." [[5089 池小橙 happy]]
"I..." [[5090 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao was speechless for a moment. She didn't know how to explain. [[5091 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, she still felt a little afraid of Chi Xiaocheng. [[5092 旁白 neutral]]
But beyond the fear, there was a complex mixture of various emotions. [[5093 旁白 neutral]]
Was there still a possibility for her to leave now, or would she be stuck here for the rest of her life? [[5094 旁白 neutral]]
