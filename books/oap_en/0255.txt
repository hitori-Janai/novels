Chapter 255: She Has Always Been the White Moonlight [[21709 旁白 neutral]]
It had been a week, and she was still a little lost, wondering whether to awaken Chi Xiaocheng's memories. [[21710 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng had mentioned it, Doctor Cheng had too, Dongfang Yang and Si Chen both had different ideas, and even Brother Chi Song and Brother Long had offered their opinions. [[21711 旁白 neutral]]
But the decision was all up to her. [[21712 旁白 neutral]]
Because she, Su Tao, had the best relationship with Xiaocheng; they were sisters, but in the eyes of some who knew the truth, they were not. [[21713 旁白 neutral]]
She was afraid that Xiaocheng would feel more pain after regaining her memories. [[21714 旁白 sad]]
She was also afraid that if Xiaocheng never regained her memories, she would stop liking her and fall for someone else. [[21715 旁白 sad]]
Fang Ning wasn't just an NPC in a game; she had a good relationship with Chi Xiaocheng. [[21716 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang didn't just see Xiaocheng as a sister; his bank card PIN was related to her. [[21717 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen always put his interests first, or so many people said. But Su Tao couldn't think of any benefit he could gain from Xiaocheng, and he wasn't as straightforward as Dongfang Yang. [[21718 旁白 neutral]]
Since he didn't see Xiaocheng as a sister, what was his attitude toward her? [[21719 旁白 neutral]]
There was a rumor that Si Chen had a tattoo on his back that said "Never Love Tao." Could this be for Xiaocheng to see, to show that he would never like Su Tao, only her? [[21720 旁白 neutral]]
Just among the people she knew, it seemed many had a relationship with Xiaocheng that was more than just friendship. What about strangers in places she didn't know about? Would they try to pursue Xiaocheng? [[21721 旁白 sad]]
Even a normal girl like Tang Tang had said that if Xiaocheng wasn't her girlfriend, she would want to try pursuing her. [[21722 旁白 neutral]]
But the truth was, Xiaocheng was not her girlfriend. [[21723 旁白 sad]]
At the very least, neither the her who had run away in the past nor the her of today had ever truly won Xiaocheng over. [[21724 旁白 sad]]
She was getting a little scared and anxious. [[21725 旁白 sad]]
She wanted to awaken Xiaocheng's memories so that Xiaocheng would go back to liking her as she did before. [[21726 旁白 neutral]]
She had made her decision before the banquet tonight and returned to the hospital to do it! [[21727 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Si Chen said, if she hesitated any longer, there would be no time left. [[21728 旁白 neutral]]
But everything that happened at the banquet changed her mind again. [[21729 旁白 neutral]]
Her relationship with Xiaocheng was getting better and better! [[21730 旁白 happy]]
From dislike at the beginning, to feeling a little uncomfortable, to calling her "Sister Su Tao" again, and now, even shopping together. [[21731 旁白 happy]]
Wasn't this a sign that things were improving? [[21732 旁白 happy]]
Would she start calling her "Taotao" next, and then say she liked her? [[21733 旁白 happy]]
Slowly, her image began to overlap with the old Xiaocheng, and with every "Sister Su Tao," the distance between them grew smaller. [[21734 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao had already figured all this out. She looked at Si Chen seriously and said, "I think the way things are going now is great." [[21735 苏桃 happy]]
"Don't let her remember the painful things, completely get rid of her yandere side, and then she'll continue to like me. Isn't that the ending that will happen next?" [[21736 苏桃 happy]]
A beautiful blueprint had already been drawn. [[21737 旁白 happy]]
Si Chen raised an eyebrow. This wasn't the answer he wanted. [[21738 旁白 neutral]]
So he asked, "But in a way, isn't that a bit selfish? You get to enjoy her good side but reject her yandere side." [[21739 司辰 neutral]]
Faced with Si Chen's question, Su Tao smiled with relief, "I used to struggle with whether I was being too selfish." [[21740 苏桃 neutral]]
"But now, I'm starting to see myself more clearly." [[21741 苏桃 neutral]]
Looking at Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao said with emotion, "No one is perfect. I have many flaws and bad habits too. I'm already a bad person, so what if I'm a little more selfish? As long as Xiaocheng is okay, that's all that matters." [[21742 苏桃 neutral]]
Even with amnesia. [[21743 旁白 neutral]]
But she was alive, had forgotten the painful things, and only had good things ahead of her. Wasn't this a new beginning in another form? [[21744 旁白 happy]]
She continued, "Actually, it doesn't matter if I'm selfish. I will love her more and more to make it up to her." [[21745 苏桃 neutral]]
So. [[21746 旁白 neutral]]
Things are good just the way they are now. [[21747 旁白 happy]]
From her words, Si Chen could feel her determination. "So, was slapping Lin Fangya at the banquet your decision?" [[21748 司辰 neutral]]
Drawing everyone's attention to herself to shield Chi Xiaocheng behind her, protecting her "doubly." [[21749 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded firmly but was a little embarrassed. "I was really angry at that moment. I even thought it would be better if that Lin Fangya died, so she would never be a threat to Xiaocheng. I must have caused a lot of trouble for you and Dongfang Yang, right?" [[21750 苏桃 sad]]
"It's nothing for me." Si Chen changed the subject. "Just don't be so impulsive next time. You drew all the fire to yourself. Have you ever thought about what would happen if you got into trouble?" [[21751 司辰 neutral]]
"That doesn't matter. If I can keep Xiaocheng safe by getting into trouble, I'm willing." [[21752 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes showed no fear as she said seriously, "Even if you and Dongfang Yang weren't there to back me up, even if everyone was my enemy, I would still have stood up in that situation." [[21753 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen was stunned. "Why? Acting without thinking is not your style." [[21754 司辰 neutral]]
"Because she is Xiaocheng, my one and only." [[21755 苏桃 happy]]
A short sentence, but it contained a thousand emotions. [[21756 旁白 happy]]
A thousand sweet words could not compare to the words "one and only." [[21757 旁白 happy]]
Si Chen could clearly feel that conviction. [[21758 旁白 neutral]]
Isn't this what makes Su Tao shine? [[21759 旁白 happy]]
She is very direct and has many flaws. [[21760 旁白 neutral]]
She could only run away from Chi Xiaocheng's intense and obsessive love, not daring to respond, which hurt her and almost led to her death. After realizing her mistake, she remained lost for a long time. [[21761 旁白 sad]]
Si Chen had once asked Doctor Lin to analyze their personalities and the possibility of them ending up together. [[21762 旁白 neutral]]
This was to confirm if investing in Chi Xiaocheng would allow him to control Su Tao and get help from her powerful father. [[21763 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, many of his advisors and confidants were present for the discussion. [[21764 旁白 neutral]]
As they talked, the topic somehow went astray. [[21765 旁白 neutral]]
One advisor said it wasn't worth investing everything. [[21766 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was not good enough for Su Tao. [[21767 旁白 neutral]]
A relationship driven by pressure can never be love. Her actions were too extreme for anyone to accept. [[21768 旁白 neutral]]
This advisor was a woman, and when she tried to see things from Su Tao's perspective, she felt overwhelmed by the pressure and wouldn't dare to get close to such a yandere. [[21769 旁白 neutral]]
Let alone fall in love with her. [[21770 旁白 neutral]]
But other advisors thought he should go all in, holding the opposite view. [[21771 旁白 neutral]]
It was Su Tao who was not good enough for Chi Xiaocheng. [[21772 旁白 neutral]]
Her already poor family raised one more person. Growing up together, Chi Xiaocheng was entrusted to her and brought to Jiuzhou City. Even if you don't consider love, she should repay the kindness of being raised and the complete trust placed in her. [[21773 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was extremely insecure, which was very obvious. She showed her love in such a way. If you don't like her, just reject her. Why get close and then run away, leading her on? [[21774 旁白 neutral]]
What started as an analysis of whether it was worth investing everything turned into a debate about who was not good enough for whom. [[21775 旁白 neutral]]
The result was that they found a lot of faults in both of their actions and personalities. [[21776 旁白 neutral]]
Both were at fault, and both needed to change. [[21777 旁白 neutral]]
Saying who was not good enough for whom was just something to say in hindsight after a breakup. [[21778 旁白 neutral]]
If they got together, loved each other, and gave their all, would anyone even say such a thing? [[21779 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, whether they could make it to the end and break the barrier between them was not for them to decide. [[21780 旁白 neutral]]
And after this discussion, Si Chen ultimately chose to be loyal to Cheng. [[21781 旁白 neutral]]
He chose to never love Tao. [[21782 旁白 neutral]]
The discussion itself was pointless because he had no other options. [[21783 旁白 neutral]]
Is Su Tao a bad person? [[21784 旁白 neutral]]
Not at all. [[21785 旁白 neutral]]
She has flaws, but how could she become a "white moonlight" for so many people without having her own good qualities? [[21786 旁白 happy]]
Just like now, Si Chen saw determination in Su Tao's eyes. [[21787 旁白 neutral]]
Many things had happened, but they also constantly made her face her own heart. [[21788 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could die for her. [[21789 旁白 neutral]]
And she had thought of dying for Chi Xiaocheng many times, and when conflict arose, she chose to stand by her Xiaocheng's side without hesitation. [[21790 旁白 happy]]
She has always been the white moonlight. [[21791 旁白 happy]]
But, she started to become selfish. [[21792 旁白 neutral]]
Her moonlight now shines only on the other her. [[21793 旁白 neutral]]
