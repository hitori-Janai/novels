第32章 昔日的"姐妹"
Chapter 32: The "Sisters" of the Past
    刘桂嘉和黄莉梅一样，是高中时期欺负原主的三巨头之一。
    Like 黄莉梅, 刘桂嘉 was one of the three main bullies who tormented the original host in high school.
    如今虽然只考了一个大专，但却也在九州市，记忆中这两个月刘桂嘉找了好几次原主麻烦。
    Now, she was only in a vocational college, but it was still in Jiuzhou City. In the original host's memories, 刘桂嘉 had caused her trouble several times over the past two months.
    每次都是语言上的侮辱，敢反抗就打一顿，然后逼她把钱交出来。
    It was always verbal abuse. If she dared to fight back, they would beat her up and force her to hand over her money.
    这已经可以定性为犯罪了，奈何原主不敢报警，也不敢反抗，压抑的环境使她变得扭曲，恰巧苏桃的事情又撞枪口上，于是被她以作发泄的源头。
    This could already be considered a crime, but the original host didn't dare to call the police or resist. The oppressive environment had twisted her personality, and unfortunately, the incident with 苏桃 became her outlet.
    然是这样，苏桃依旧温柔地对待原主，想感化她，可见白月光人设的魅力。
    Even so, 苏桃 continued to treat the original host with kindness, trying to win her over. It just shows the charm of a "white moonlight" character.
    本就和自己有矛盾，那应该怎么被欺负呢？
    Since they were already on bad terms, how should she go about getting bullied?
    池小橙看着自己发去的消息，玩味地笑了笑。
    池小橙 looked at the message she had sent and smiled playfully.
    果不其然，刘桂嘉发了消息过来，"可以啊，我在你家等你？"
    As expected, a message came from 刘桂嘉. "Sure, should I wait for you at your place?"
    "好。"
    "Okay."
    之前欺负自己还是在回家的路上，这下倒好，竟然敢直接跑到自己家里。
    Before, they had always bullied her on her way home. Now, they were bold enough to come directly to her house.
    池小橙不用猜就知道，对方已经被气笑了。
    池小橙 didn't have to guess to know that the other girl was probably laughing with rage.
    长期被欺负的家伙，忽然跟自己说要求还钱，第一反应自然是觉得可笑。
    When someone you've been bullying for a long time suddenly demands their money back, your first reaction is naturally to find it ridiculous.
    什么档次的小垃圾，竟然还敢反抗了？
    What kind of worthless trash dares to fight back?
    看来是还没教训够。
    It seemed she hadn't been taught a proper lesson yet.
    ——换位思考下，池小橙肯定也会这样想，但没关系，这次回家就是奔着被欺负去的。
    Putting herself in their shoes, 池小橙 knew she would have thought the same thing. But it didn't matter; she was heading home specifically to get bullied.
    但如果没人知道自己被欺负，这次计划效果就没那么强了。
    However, if no one knew she was being bullied, the plan wouldn't be as effective.
    池小橙稍微思考了一下，又看了眼吧台的憨厚汉子。
    池小橙 thought for a moment, then glanced at the honest-looking man behind the counter.
    缓缓道，"那我今天先回去准备准备，明天我来正式上岗？"
    Slowly, she said, "Well, I'll head back to get ready today. I can start my first official day tomorrow?"
    褚三点了点头，"好的。"
    褚三 nodded. "Alright."
    "嗯嗯，我回去学习一下这些相关的知识，我们加一下微信吧，有什么事情你可以联系我。"
    "Okay, I'll go home and study up on everything. Let's add each other on WeChat, so you can contact me if anything comes up."
    池小橙主动加了褚三的微信，而后又回到自己的座位收拾东西，笑吟吟地招手，"今天就麻烦褚三叔叔一个人看店啦，拜拜~"
    池小橙 took the initiative to add 褚三's WeChat, then returned to her seat to pack her things. Waving with a smile, she said, "I'll have to trouble Uncle 褚三 to watch the shop alone today. Bye-bye~"
    挥着小手，池小橙脚步轻快地出了店门。
    Waving her small hand, 池小橙 skipped lightly out of the shop.
    看得大叔一脸温柔，"我要是也有这么可爱的一个女儿就好了。"
    The uncle watched her go with a gentle expression. "If only I had such a cute daughter."
    可惜他现在35了，连老婆都没有。
    Too bad he was already 35 and didn't even have a wife.
    微信点击同意好友，褚三继续在吧台候着，眼尖的他，忽然在池小橙刚刚的桌上发现一块手帕。
    After accepting the friend request on WeChat, 褚三 returned to waiting at the counter. With his sharp eyes, he suddenly spotted a handkerchief on the table where 池小橙 had been sitting.
    粉橙相间，上面还印着一个个卡通的小橙子，好似残留独属于女孩子的淡香。
    It was pink and orange with little cartoon oranges printed on it, and it seemed to carry the faint, sweet scent unique to a young girl.
    疑惑着走了过去，褚三眨了眨眼，"刚刚那位小姐留下的吗，看来是忘记拿了。"
    He walked over, puzzled, and blinked. "Did the young lady leave this behind? Looks like she forgot it."
    "她明天也会过来，先放着吧。"
    "She's coming back tomorrow, so I'll just keep it here for now."
    伸手将手帕拿起，褚三忽然又皱了皱眉，"可万一这是什么比较重要的东西，要不还是知会她一声吧。"
    Reaching out to pick up the handkerchief, 褚三 suddenly frowned. "But what if this is something important? Maybe I should let her know."
    心中改变了想法，褚三给池小橙发去了消息。
    Having changed his mind, 褚三 sent a message to 池小橙.
    一直拖到十几分钟后，池小橙即将到家了，他才收到消息的回复。
    It took over ten minutes, just as 池小橙 was about to arrive home, before he received a reply.
    发来的是一条语音，语气很是着急，"呜呜呜我还以为这条手帕不见了呢，原来是落在了咖啡厅，太好了，真是太好了。"
    It was a voice message, and her tone was urgent. "Oh, no, I thought I'd lost that handkerchief! It was at the coffee shop... That's great, that's so great."
    她拍着小胸脯，一副松了口气的模样。
    She patted her chest, looking as if a great weight had been lifted.
    褚三拿着手帕，感到一丝异样，紧张询问道，"这个东西对你很重要吗？"
    Holding the handkerchief, 褚三 felt something was a little off and asked nervously, "Is this item very important to you?"
    "嗯嗯，这是我打算送给别人的礼物，现在的话...我忙不过来，褚三叔叔能麻烦你帮我送过来吗？"
    "Yes, it's a gift I plan to give someone. Right now... I'm a bit tied up. Uncle 褚三, could I trouble you to bring it to me?"
    这一条语音才发出去，池小橙又补了一句。
    Just after that voice message was sent, 池小橙 added another sentence.
    "这样也不行，太麻烦你了，我发地址给你，你帮我叫个闪送吧，钱我出就行，谢谢褚三叔叔！"
    "No, that won't work, it's too much trouble for you. I'll send you my address, and you can call a flash delivery for me. I'll pay for it. Thank you, Uncle 褚三!"
    说完，一个定位发了过来。
    After she spoke, a location pin was sent.
    并附上了楼层和房间。
    Including the floor and room number.
    褚三听着这几句话，心中暖意渐增。
    Hearing these words, a warm feeling grew in 褚三's heart.
    多懂事的小家伙，觉得自己送麻烦还叫闪送。
    What a considerate little one, thinking it would be a bother and asking for a delivery service instead.
    明明很可爱，少爷为什么总说他是小蠢货呢？
    She's so adorable, why does the Young Master always call her a little fool?
    褚三不懂，但看了眼毫无客人的咖啡厅，便回复道，"没事，我给你送过去吧，也不用再多叫个闪送，你稍微等我一会儿。"
    褚三 didn't understand, but he glanced at the empty coffee shop and replied, "It's alright, I'll bring it over to you. No need for a delivery service. Just wait for me for a little while."
    "好的好的，麻烦你了。"
    "Okay, okay, sorry to trouble you."
    话语结束，褚三拿着手帕就打算关门，却见苏桃从外面走了过来，"褚大叔，这是要出门吗？"
    Just as the conversation ended, 褚三 took the handkerchief and was about to close the shop when he saw 苏桃 approaching from outside. "Uncle 褚, are you heading out?"
    褚三比了个问候贵族小姐才会做的手势，恭敬道，"原来是苏小姐，池小橙小姐在我这里落了一条手帕，我正准备给她送回去呢。"
    褚三 made a gesture of greeting typically reserved for noble ladies and said respectfully, "Ah, it's Miss 苏. Miss 池小橙 left a handkerchief here, and I was just about to return it to her."
    "额...小橙不在这吗？"苏桃还以为池小橙在，想看看她之后上班的环境呢。
    "Oh... so 小橙 isn't here?" 苏桃 had thought 池小橙 would be here and wanted to see the place where she would be working.
    褚三耐心回答，"刚刚和少爷来这里看了下情况，刚离开不到半小时。"
    褚三 answered patiently, "She came by with the Young Master to check things out. She left less than half an hour ago."
    "这样啊，我正好要去找小橙，我帮你送过去吧。"
    "I see. Well, I was just on my way to find 小橙 anyway. I can take it to her for you."
    "这......"褚三犹豫了一下。
    "Well..." 褚三 hesitated.
    苏桃笑着说道，"叔你放心吧，我和小橙已经和解了，不然她也不会和东方阳一起是不？"
    苏桃 said with a smile, "Don't worry, Uncle. 小橙 and I have already made up. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been with 东方阳, right?"
    她以前经常在咖啡厅和东方阳倾诉池小橙的事情，长久下来，褚三也听了个大概。
    In the past, she had often vented to 东方阳 about 池小橙 at the coffee shop, so over time, 褚三 had heard the general story.
    听到苏桃那么说，也就放心了下来，"那麻烦苏小姐了。"
    Hearing 苏桃 say that, he felt relieved. "Then I'll have to trouble Miss 苏."
    接过手帕，苏桃心中有些微妙，舒适的布料让她好似在摩挲池小橙的细软小手。
    Taking the handkerchief, 苏桃 felt a strange sensation. The soft fabric felt as if she were caressing 池小橙's delicate little hands.
    她还是第一次感觉这么奇妙。
    It was the first time she had ever felt something so peculiar.
    殊不知，这都是手帕中"灰姑娘"的效果，拿到手的人会不由自主地联想到池小橙本人。
    Little did she know, this was all thanks to the "Cinderella" effect of the handkerchief. Whoever held it would instinctively think of 池小橙.
    而另一边，池小橙已经到了小区。
    Meanwhile, 池小橙 had already arrived at her apartment complex.
    安心地将手机放好。
    She put her phone away, feeling at ease.
    观众已经准备好了。
    The audience was now in place.
    她拍了拍小脸，走进电梯。
    She patted her cheeks and stepped into the elevator.
    将别着秀发两端浅马尾的发夹取下，又狠狠地挠了几下头发。
    She took off the clips holding her hair in low pigtails and messed it up with a few vigorous scratches.
    她啧了一声，不满嘟嘴，"有时候头发太柔顺，长得漂亮也不好，气质有点难降下来啊。"
    She clicked her tongue and pouted, "Sometimes being pretty with silky hair is a pain. It's hard to tone down my aura."
    出门前她为了以好的印象去拉东方阳好感，可是特意打理了一下。
    Before leaving, she had specially styled her hair to make a good impression on 东方阳.
    现在面对欺负原主的人，需要体现出软弱才能让她们得寸进尺。
    Now, facing the people who bullied the original host, she needed to appear weak to make them push their luck.
    没办法，池小橙把卫衣的帽子盖上，然后狠狠摩擦帽子产生静电，没一会儿头发就乱糟糟的。
    With no other choice, 池小橙 pulled up the hood of her sweatshirt and rubbed it hard to create static electricity. In no time, her hair was a mess.
    可即便如此，也掩盖不了自身的可爱。
    But even so, it couldn't hide her cuteness.
    但已经足够了。
    But it was enough.
    电梯门打开。
    The elevator doors opened.
    池小橙戴着卫帽，稍微佝偻了一下身子。
    Wearing her hood, 池小橙 hunched her body over slightly.
    演技，展开！
    Time to act!
    完全一副胆怯娇弱的无害女孩。
    She looked exactly like a timid, fragile, and harmless girl.
    走出电梯门，她便看到有两个女生在楼道这里等着了。
    As she stepped out of the elevator, she saw two girls waiting for her in the hallway.
    露着肚子和大腿的小尺度衣服，挑染一头黄毛，吸烟、唇钉、重重的眼影，此外还有不良少女特有的各种链子装饰。
    They wore revealing clothes that showed off their stomachs and thighs, had bleached-blonde highlights, and sported cigarettes, lip piercings, heavy eyeshadow, and all the chains and accessories typical of a delinquent girl.
    这才是经典的反派印象啊。
    Now *this* was the classic image of a villain.
    再看看自己，同样是反派，一点气势都没有。
    Compared to them, she was also a villain, but she had no intimidating presence at all.
    她走入楼道，布凡鞋踏出"哒哒"的声音吟唱清脆。
    She walked into the hallway, her cloth shoes making a clear "tap, tap" sound.
    为首的黄毛，刘桂嘉看向池小橙，高高地抬着脑袋，扬起讥讽的笑容，"哟，我们可爱的小橙回来了呀。"
    The blonde leader, 刘桂嘉, looked at 池小橙, tilting her head up high with a mocking smile. "Well, well, if it isn't our dear little 小橙, back home."
