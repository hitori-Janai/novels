Chapter 32: Former "Sisters" [[2719 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia, like Huang Limei, was one of the three main bullies who targeted the original owner in high school. [[2720 旁白 neutral]]
Although she only got into a vocational college, she was also in Jiuzhou City. In the original owner's memory, Liu Guijia had troubled her several times in the past two months. [[2721 旁白 neutral]]
It was always verbal insults, and if she dared to resist, they would beat her up and force her to hand over her money. [[2722 旁白 neutral]]
This could already be considered a crime, but the original owner didn't dare to call the police or fight back. The oppressive environment had twisted her, and Su Tao's situation just happened to be the final straw, becoming an outlet for her frustration. [[2723 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, Su Tao still treated the original owner gently, trying to change her for the better, which shows the charm of the "white moonlight" character. [[2724 旁白 neutral]]
*Since I already have a conflict with them, how should I get bullied?* [[2725 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the message she had sent and smiled playfully. [[2726 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, Liu Guijia sent a message back, "Sure, I'll wait for you at your place?" [[2727 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
"Okay." [[2728 池小橙 neutral]]
*They used to bully me on the way home, but now they dare to come directly to my house.* [[2729 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't have to guess to know that the other person was laughing out of anger. [[2730 旁白 neutral]]
For someone who had been bullied for so long to suddenly ask for money back, the first reaction would naturally be to find it ridiculous. [[2731 旁白 neutral]]
*"What kind of trash are you to dare to fight back?"* [[2732 旁白 neutral]]
*"It seems you haven't been taught enough of a lesson."* [[2733 旁白 neutral]]
—If she were in their shoes, Chi Xiaocheng would have thought the same thing. But it didn't matter; she was going home this time specifically to *be* bullied. [[2734 旁白 neutral]]
*But if no one knew I was being bullied, the plan wouldn't be as effective.* [[2735 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought for a moment, then glanced at the simple-looking man behind the counter. [[2736 旁白 neutral]]
She said slowly, "Well, I'll go home and prepare today. I'll come for my first official shift tomorrow?" [[2737 池小橙 neutral]]
Chu San nodded, "Okay." [[2738 褚三 neutral]]
"Mhm, I'll go back and study up on the relevant information. Let's add each other on WeChat, so you can contact me if anything comes up." [[2739 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng took the initiative to add Chu San on WeChat, then returned to her seat to pack her things. She waved with a smile, "I'll have to trouble Uncle Chu San to watch the store alone today. Bye-bye~" [[2740 池小橙 happy]]
Waving her small hand, Chi Xiaocheng left the shop with a light spring in her step. [[2741 旁白 neutral]]
The uncle watched her with a gentle expression, "I wish I had such a cute daughter too." [[2742 褚三 happy]]
Unfortunately, he was 35 now and didn't even have a wife. [[2743 旁白 neutral]]
After accepting the friend request on WeChat, Chu San continued to wait at the counter. With his sharp eyes, he suddenly spotted a handkerchief on the table Chi Xiaocheng had just left. [[2744 旁白 neutral]]
It was pink and orange, with little cartoon oranges printed on it, and seemed to carry the faint, sweet scent of a young girl. [[2745 旁白 neutral]]
He walked over, puzzled, and blinked. "Did the young lady from just now leave this? It seems she forgot to take it." [[2746 褚三 neutral]]
"She's coming again tomorrow, so I'll just leave it here for now." [[2747 褚三 neutral]]
Reaching out to pick up the handkerchief, Chu San suddenly frowned again. "But what if this is something important? Maybe I should let her know." [[2748 褚三 neutral]]
Changing his mind, Chu San sent a message to Chi Xiaocheng. [[2749 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until more than ten minutes later, when Chi Xiaocheng was almost home, that he received a reply. [[2750 旁白 neutral]]
The reply was a voice message, her tone anxious. "Sob... I thought I lost this handkerchief. It was left at the cafe, that's great, that's really great." [[2751 池小橙 sad]]
She patted her chest, looking relieved. [[2752 旁白 neutral]]
Holding the handkerchief, Chu San felt something was a bit off and asked nervously, "Is this item very important to you?" [[2753 褚三 neutral]]
"Yes, it's a gift I plan to give to someone. Right now... I'm too busy. Uncle Chu San, could I trouble you to bring it to me?" [[2754 池小橙 neutral]]
Just after sending that voice message, Chi Xiaocheng added another sentence. [[2755 旁白 neutral]]
"Actually, that's no good, it would be too much trouble for you. I'll send you the address, could you call a flash delivery for me? I'll pay for it. Thank you, Uncle Chu San!" [[2756 池小橙 happy]]
After saying that, she sent a location pin. [[2757 旁白 neutral]]
It included the floor and room number. [[2758 旁白 neutral]]
Listening to her words, a warm feeling grew in Chu San's heart. [[2759 旁白 neutral]]
*What a considerate little girl, thinking it would be a bother for him to deliver it and asking for a flash delivery instead.* [[2760 褚三 happy]]
*She's so cute, why does the young master always call her a little fool?* [[2761 褚三 neutral]]
Chu San didn't understand, but he glanced at the empty cafe and replied, "It's alright, I'll bring it over to you. No need to call a delivery service. Just wait for me for a little bit." [[2762 褚三 happy]]
"Okay, okay, sorry to trouble you." [[2763 池小橙 happy]]
After the exchange, Chu San took the handkerchief and was about to close the shop when he saw Su Tao walking in from outside. "Uncle Chu, are you heading out?" [[2764 苏桃 neutral]]
Chu San made a gesture of greeting typically used for noble ladies and said respectfully, "Ah, Miss Su. Miss Chi Xiaocheng left a handkerchief here, and I was just about to return it to her." [[2765 褚三 neutral]]
"Oh... Xiaocheng isn't here?" Su Tao had thought Chi Xiaocheng was there and wanted to see the environment where she would be working. [[2766 苏桃 neutral]]
Chu San answered patiently, "She just came here with the young master to check things out. They left less than half an hour ago." [[2767 褚三 neutral]]
"I see. I was just on my way to find Xiaocheng anyway. I can deliver it for you." [[2768 苏桃 happy]]
"Well..." Chu San hesitated. [[2769 褚三 neutral]]
Su Tao said with a smile, "Don't worry, Uncle. Xiaocheng and I have already reconciled. Otherwise, she wouldn't be with Dongfang Yang, right?" [[2770 苏桃 happy]]
She used to often vent to Dongfang Yang about Chi Xiaocheng at the cafe, so over time, Chu San had heard the general story. [[2771 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Su Tao say that, he felt relieved. "Then I'll have to trouble you, Miss Su." [[2772 褚三 neutral]]
Taking the handkerchief, Su Tao felt a strange sensation. The comfortable fabric felt as if she were stroking Chi Xiaocheng's soft little hands. [[2773 旁白 neutral]]
It was the first time she had ever felt something so peculiar. [[2774 旁白 neutral]]
Little did she know, this was all due to the "Cinderella" effect of the handkerchief. Whoever held it would involuntarily think of Chi Xiaocheng herself. [[2775 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng had already arrived at her apartment complex. [[2776 旁白 neutral]]
She put her phone away with peace of mind. [[2777 旁白 neutral]]
*The audience is ready.* [[2778 池小橙 happy]]
She patted her cheeks and stepped into the elevator. [[2779 旁白 neutral]]
She took off the hairpin that held her hair in low pigtails and messed up her hair by scratching it vigorously. [[2780 旁白 neutral]]
She clicked her tongue and pouted with dissatisfaction. "Sometimes having hair that's too smooth and being pretty isn't a good thing. It's hard to tone down my aura." [[2781 池小橙 neutral]]
Before going out, she had specially styled her hair to make a good impression on Dongfang Yang. [[2782 旁白 neutral]]
Now, facing the people who bullied the original owner, she needed to appear weak to make them push their luck. [[2783 旁白 neutral]]
Having no other choice, Chi Xiaocheng put on her hoodie, then rubbed the hood vigorously to create static electricity. In no time, her hair was a mess. [[2784 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, it couldn't hide her cuteness. [[2785 旁白 neutral]]
But it was enough. [[2786 旁白 neutral]]
The elevator doors opened. [[2787 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, wearing her hood, slouched her body slightly. [[2788 旁白 neutral]]
*Acting, begin!* [[2789 池小橙 happy]]
She looked completely like a timid, delicate, and harmless girl. [[2790 旁白 neutral]]
As she stepped out of the elevator, she saw two girls waiting in the hallway. [[2791 旁白 neutral]]
They wore revealing clothes that showed their stomachs and thighs, had bleached-blond highlights, smoked, had lip piercings, heavy eyeshadow, and various chains characteristic of delinquent girls. [[2792 旁白 neutral]]
*Now that's the classic image of a villain.* [[2793 池小橙 neutral]]
*Looking at myself, also a villain, I have no presence at all.* [[2794 池小橙 neutral]]
She walked into the hallway, the "da da" sound of her canvas shoes echoing crisply. [[2795 旁白 neutral]]
The blonde leader, Liu Guijia, looked at Chi Xiaocheng, her head held high with a mocking smile. "Well, well, if it isn't our dear little Xiaocheng, back home." [[2796 刘桂嘉 angry]]
