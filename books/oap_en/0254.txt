Chapter 254: The distance gets closer and closer [[21626 旁白 neutral]]
The small balloon was hit, and the Big Big Wolf doll, the grand prize, was won. Some were happy, some were sad. [[21627 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao cheered happily on the side. Even though it cost a lot of money, she wanted to maintain her image as an "older sister." She held back tears at the thought of her future budget meals and called for the owner to give her the doll. [[21628 苏桃 happy]]
At that moment, she even wanted to reach out and hug Chi Xiaocheng. [[21629 苏桃 happy]]
But their relationship had just started to improve, so she felt a little timid. [[21630 苏桃 neutral]]
In the past, she probably would have leaned on her naturally. [[21631 苏桃 neutral]]
As for Chi Xiaocheng, she was, of course, clapping on the side, showing her small, expectant canine teeth. [[21632 池小橙 happy]]
She couldn't help but think to herself that the female lead was truly the female lead. [[21633 池小橙 neutral]]
Her luck was maxed out. [[21634 池小橙 neutral]]
Usually, at these kinds of stalls, the toy guns are rigged to make more money from customers. But this owner seemed to be a step ahead, hiding a remote or something in his hand, making it almost impossible to win by luck. [[21635 旁白 neutral]]
After she pretended to be a yandere to scare him, he dropped his little remote. Su Tao was so flustered she couldn't even aim properly, yet she managed to hit the smallest balloon with one shot. [[21636 旁白 neutral]]
You have to know, in the previous 50 shots, she hadn't hit any of the three middle balloons, whether they were medium or tiny. [[21637 旁白 neutral]]
If the owner hadn't been cheating, Chi Xiaocheng felt that with Su Tao's female lead luck, she could have won the grand prize with a single shot. [[21638 池小橙 neutral]]
But well... [[21639 池小橙 neutral]]
Watching Su Tao proudly hand her the Big Big Wolf doll, Chi Xiaocheng smiled and hugged the big, soft, one-meter-tall doll. [[21640 池小橙 happy]]
She said sweetly, "Thank you, Sister Su Tao~" [[21641 池小橙 happy]]
Her voice was soft and cute, full of affection. [[21642 旁白 neutral]]
There was no need to tell Tao Tao about these things. She won the doll for me through her own effort. [[21643 池小橙 neutral]]
This result would give her great emotional satisfaction and make her happy. [[21644 池小橙 neutral]]
That was enough. [[21645 池小橙 neutral]]
Only the owner would never figure out how he had fumbled the remote and let them win the grand prize. [[21646 旁白 neutral]]
After stuffing the doll into Chi Xiaocheng's arms, Su Tao couldn't help but complain, feeling the pinch, "That was 520 yuan! I almost lost money on that." [[21647 苏桃 sad]]
"It's not a loss~" Chi Xiaocheng hugged the doll and moved closer to Su Tao. She made one of the doll's hands touch Su Tao and rub against her gently. [[21648 池小橙 happy]]
"I like the number 520." [[21649 池小橙 happy]]
Besides, who said the money was really spent? [[21650 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked over to the owner and said softly, "Sir, we don't want the small prizes for the balloons we popped. Can you refund us 300 yuan?" [[21651 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing this, the owner's dazed expression instantly turned serious. "Little girl, are you trying to kill me? If you don't want the prizes, I can give you 10 yuan back for each one at most." [[21652 老板 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng innocently waved her phone. "I was recording a video just now. Sir, it looked like you dropped... a piece of chewing gum from your hand?" [[21653 池小橙 neutral]]
At these words, the owner's expression froze. [[21654 旁白 neutral]]
He subconsciously stuck out his foot to cover the small remote control. [[21655 旁白 neutral]]
He looked again at this sweet and lovely little girl. [[21656 旁白 neutral]]
He thought to himself that the scary sight he saw earlier wasn't a hallucination. [[21657 老板 sad]]
This little girl was definitely not as innocent as she appeared! [[21658 老板 neutral]]
The owner was experienced. He took out his phone. "Alright, since you're so cute, I'll refund you 300." [[21659 老板 neutral]]
This area was already the "rich district" of Jiuzhou City. No one knew if such a pretty girl was the young miss of some powerful family. [[21660 旁白 neutral]]
She had given him a way out without him losing too much money. He had no reason to refuse. [[21661 旁白 neutral]]
He scanned the code and sent the refund. Only Su Tao stood there, clueless about what had just happened. [[21662 旁白 neutral]]
They could get 300 yuan back just by not taking the small prizes? [[21663 苏桃 neutral]]
Maybe the owner was really won over by Xiaocheng's cuteness? [[21664 苏桃 neutral]]
She didn't quite get it, but she remembered one thing. [[21665 苏桃 neutral]]
"I like the number 520." [[21666 苏桃 neutral]]
Xiaocheng said that to me. Does that mean she's changing back to how she was before and starting to like me a little? [[21667 苏桃 happy]]
Without awakening those painful memories, just being innocent and cute like this, breaking down the barrier, getting closer and closer, and finally starting to like me again. [[21668 苏桃 happy]]
Becoming just like she used to be. [[21669 苏桃 happy]]
The shooting game was just a small episode. The two continued towards the arcade. [[21670 旁白 neutral]]
With their stunning looks, the two of them already turned heads. Now, carrying this big wolf, passersby couldn't help but take out their phones to capture the scene. [[21671 旁白 neutral]]
It was unclear if they were photographing the wolf... [[21672 旁白 neutral]]
Or the cute little girl holding it. [[21673 旁白 neutral]]
Arriving at the arcade, Chi Xiaocheng took a turn into the children's area. [[21674 旁白 neutral]]
Once inside, she instantly became the center of attention. [[21675 旁白 neutral]]
A crowd of children saw the big wolf and ran over, surprised and joyful. [[21676 旁白 neutral]]
They called her "sister" and wanted to hug the wolf and take pictures with it. [[21677 旁白 neutral]]
"Be jealous. This is a gift from Tao Tao to me." [[21678 池小橙 happy]]
"You want a photo?" [[21679 池小橙 neutral]]
"No way!" [[21680 池小橙 angry]]
—If this were the yandere Xiaocheng, this is how she would have acted. [[21681 旁白 neutral]]
But this was the normal Xiaocheng. If everyone likes the wolf, of course that's fine. [[21682 池小橙 happy]]
"Let's take a picture together!" [[21683 池小橙 happy]]
In Su Tao's eyes, this scene became Chi Xiaocheng letting others take pictures with the wolf she had worked so hard to win. [[21684 苏桃 sad]]
Even if they were just a group of children. [[21685 苏桃 sad]]
But that was my gift to you. I spent money and effort on a gift meant only for you. [[21686 苏桃 sad]]
Sharing it with others like this... [[21687 苏桃 sad]]
It was a bit upsetting. [[21688 苏桃 sad]]
But even with these thoughts, Su Tao wouldn't say it out loud. As she watched Chi Xiaocheng, someone tapped her on the shoulder. [[21689 旁白 neutral]]
"What are you two doing here?" [[21690 司辰 neutral]]
She turned to see it was Si Chen. [[21691 旁白 neutral]]
"Aren't you supposed to be at the banquet dealing with things?" [[21692 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao was surprised to see Si Chen here. He shouldn't be interested in arcades, especially not the children's section. [[21693 苏桃 neutral]]
Faced with the question, Si Chen was at a loss for words. He patted the chubby boy next to him, "Dongfang Yang took over at the banquet. My little brother is feeling childish and wanted to come play here." [[21694 司辰 neutral]]
"Second brother, I did not! I hate kids the most!" [[21695 司赖 angry]]
Si Lai immediately retorted. Then he saw Si Chen turn and give him a threatening look. [[21696 旁白 neutral]]
Cold sweat broke out on his forehead. "Haha, just kidding. I have a buddy who hangs out here, a 'kidult'. Haven't seen him in a while, so I just dropped by." [[21697 司赖 neutral]]
"Ahem, you guys chat. I'm going to find my buddy." [[21698 司赖 neutral]]
He scurried away, leaving Si Chen and Su Tao alone, while Chi Xiaocheng was surrounded by a group of little girls who loved the doll. [[21699 旁白 neutral]]
Both of them instinctively looked towards the little girl who was the center of attention. [[21700 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen put his hands in his pockets and asked in a voice only they could hear, "Have you decided yet? Are you going to awaken Chi Xiaocheng's memories? She's only a little tired after playing all day. Her condition is good. She should be able to leave the hospital this week." [[21701 司辰 neutral]]
"If you don't decide soon, it will be troublesome later." [[21702 司辰 neutral]]
Right now, they could still use her "illness" as a reason to try and awaken her memories openly. [[21703 旁白 neutral]]
Once she leaves the hospital, it will be hard to find a reason. [[21704 旁白 neutral]]
Forcing it would make Chi Xiaocheng suspicious. [[21705 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao understood all of this, and she knew what Si Chen meant. [[21706 苏桃 neutral]]
But this time, she didn't hesitate. Her gaze was calm and confident. "I've decided. I won't awaken her memories. Let's let things happen naturally." [[21707 苏桃 neutral]]
