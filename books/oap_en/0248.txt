Chapter 248: impulse for her [[21147 旁白 neutral]]
One was a yandere, and the other seemed to be on the verge of becoming unhinged. At the same time, they both showed hostility toward Lin Fangya. [[21148 旁白 neutral]]
If you had to say whose hostility was stronger. [[21149 旁白 neutral]]
Without a doubt, it was Su Tao! [[21150 旁白 neutral]]
You have to understand, in that accident, she almost, almost lost Xiaocheng forever! [[21151 旁白 sad]]
She had countless nightmares where Xiaocheng left her each time. Of the three people responsible, Ye Liang was already dead. [[21152 旁白 neutral]]
Now, besides Xiao Ming, there was this Lin Fangya! [[21153 旁白 angry]]
It was bad enough when she targeted Su Tao before, but she had almost killed Xiaocheng! [[21154 旁白 angry]]
They hadn't been able to find her, and now she dared to speak about her Xiaocheng like this! [[21155 旁白 angry]]
Her expression turned gloomy, all her usual coolness gone. [[21156 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, she didn't even care about the Young Master Du who wanted to give Chi Xiaocheng roses. Her eyes were fixed on Lin Fangya. [[21157 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng took advantage of everyone's attention being drawn to Su Tao by Lin Fangya, and secretly took an emotion-numbing pill. [[21158 旁白 neutral]]
She also used an acting card to boost her acting skills to the ultimate level. [[21159 旁白 neutral]]
Only then could she barely stop herself from wanting to kill this person on the spot. [[21160 池小橙 angry]]
With so many guests around, Chi Xiaocheng kept telling herself not to be impulsive, almost trying to hypnotize herself. [[21161 池小橙 neutral]]
Even the System couldn't hold back and was screaming frantically in Chi Xiaocheng's mind. [[21162 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, don't be impulsive! Impulsiveness is the devil!] [[21163 系统 sad]]
[There are so many people here, and security too. Whether you can even succeed is one thing, but the consequences will be endless!] [[21164 系统 sad]]
[It won't just affect you, it will affect Su Tao even more.] [[21165 系统 sad]]
[Lin Fangya is a named minor character. She got close to Ye Liang and has a murky relationship with Xiao Ming. After Ye Liang died, she predictably gained some plot relevance, taking his place as a lower-tier villain.] [[21166 系统 neutral]]
[If you kill her, you'll likely be targeted by the world's will again, and faking your death won't work anymore!] [[21167 系统 sad]]
"But System, she dared to call my Taotao a cheap woman!" [[21168 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's pupils started to turn red and cat-like again. [[21169 旁白 neutral]]
[Hiss— She's just running her mouth. Dongfang Yang and Si Chen are here too. This minor character definitely won't get away!] [[21170 系统 sad]]
[So don't be impulsive for now. Take a deep breath... a deep breath, okay?] [[21171 系统 sad]]
No one present knew what Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao were thinking, and no one thought these two seemingly weak girls could cause any trouble. [[21172 旁白 neutral]]
They just followed Lin Fangya's gaze and saw the two girls' expressions turn dark. [[21173 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if some lie had been exposed. [[21174 旁白 neutral]]
If this were a bustling market, some people might have followed Lin Fangya's lead and started pointing fingers at Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao without knowing the facts. [[21175 旁白 neutral]]
However, the young masters and ladies present had all received strict upbringings. [[21176 旁白 neutral]]
Not only did they not join in the commotion, but they all retreated to a safe distance, with expressions of people ready to watch a show. [[21177 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya seemed to have her own confidence and wasn't scared at all. Seeing Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao's mild reaction, she became even more arrogant, "Everyone, look at their faces. Aren't they speechless because I exposed their lies?" [[21178 林芳雅 angry]]
"In the end, they're just two low-class peasants from the countryside. Do they really think they can come here and find a rich husband?" [[21179 林芳雅 angry]]
Lin Fangya opened a folding fan and walked toward Chi Xiaocheng, her eyes full of disgust. [[21180 旁白 neutral]]
Once, she had been so close to successfully latching onto Ye Liang. [[21181 旁白 neutral]]
She was about to transform into a phoenix and soar, but this girl had shattered her dream of flying. [[21182 旁白 sad]]
Ye Liang was dead, so didn't that make all her previous efforts a joke? [[21183 旁白 sad]]
And now, she finally had her chance. [[21184 旁白 happy]]
However, before she could reach Chi Xiaocheng, Si Chen stepped out from the crowd, even faster than Su Tao. [[21185 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the Si family's home. Are you trying to bring disaster to the Lin family by twisting the truth like this?" [[21186 司辰 angry]]
The 1.9-meter-tall young man stood beside Chi Xiaocheng, and his words made the other people with the surname Lin turn pale. [[21187 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya snorted lightly, "Young Master Si Chen, you're not really going to take her side, are you? I'm not representing the Lin family right now, you know~" [[21188 林芳雅 neutral]]
She took out a token. It was dark green, small and exquisite, and more importantly, it had the character "Ye" clearly written on it. [[21189 旁白 neutral]]
When Si Chen saw the token, he couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. [[21190 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya chuckled, "I'm with Second Young Master Ye now. I don't need to tell you how influential he is in the capital, do I, Young Master Si Chen? Are you planning to stay in Jiuzhou City forever?" [[21191 林芳雅 angry]]
She was borrowing power from someone else to bully others. [[21192 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen finally understood why Lin Fangya was being so bold. It turned out she had latched onto Second Young Master Ye. [[21193 旁白 neutral]]
And this guest from far away hadn't even appeared at the banquet yet. [[21194 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen hesitated for a moment. [[21195 旁白 neutral]]
He seemed to be weighing the benefits between Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao versus the situation with the capital. [[21196 旁白 neutral]]
He wasn't an impulsive person to begin with, and he also doubted the truth of her words. [[21197 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, it wasn't like he was well-liked in the capital anyway, right? [[21198 旁白 neutral]]
Furthermore, he didn't think Second Young Master Ye would become his enemy over a woman like this. [[21199 旁白 neutral]]
Siding with Chi Xiaocheng was the right choice! [[21200 旁白 happy]]
After three seconds of thought, he made his decision. Si Chen looked up again, about to say something. [[21201 旁白 neutral]]
But somehow, Lin Fangya had already moved in front of him. [[21202 旁白 neutral]]
She raised a hand high, aiming to slap Chi Xiaocheng across the face. [[21203 旁白 angry]]
Her hand was already halfway through the motion. [[21204 旁白 neutral]]
However, before her hand could land, Si Chen quickly grabbed her wrist. [[21205 旁白 neutral]]
His face darkened. [[21206 旁白 angry]]
Before he could speak, he suddenly heard a painful cry from beside him. [[21207 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah—it hurts!" [[21208 池小橙 sad]]
At the same time, the sound of a slap echoed through the hall, but it was a bit too loud. It didn't sound like it hit a face, more like it hit the flesh of a leg. [[21209 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, not just Si Chen, but even Lin Fangya was stunned. [[21210 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen was holding her hand, so where did that sound come from? [[21211 林芳雅 neutral]]
I didn't even hit you! [[21212 林芳雅 angry]]
But in reality, Chi Xiaocheng had already fallen from the sofa to the ground. She was clutching her face with tears in her eyes, spitting out something that looked like ketchup. The collar of her pure white dress was stained with a bit of color. [[21213 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen knew exactly what Chi Xiaocheng was up to. [[21214 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment of shock, he exploded with rage. [[21215 司辰 angry]]
"What are you doing!" [[21216 司辰 angry]]
Before he could put on an exaggerated performance, a cool figure rushed past him. [[21217 旁白 neutral]]
With a trace of anxiety and panic, she knelt down to check on Chi Xiaocheng. [[21218 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng, you..." [[21219 苏桃 sad]]
Before she could finish, her eyes landed on the red liquid trickling from the corner of Chi Xiaocheng's mouth. [[21220 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao with teary eyes, her face full of grievance, "Sister Su Tao... it hurts... it hurts so much..." [[21221 池小橙 sad]]
That fragile and pitiful voice instantly made Su Tao burn with anger. [[21222 旁白 angry]]
Her once calm eyes, which held a gentle coldness, softened for a moment, "Xiaocheng, just wait a second." [[21223 苏桃 sad]]
With that, she turned around. [[21224 旁白 neutral]]
She looked up at Lin Fangya, the gentleness in her eyes vanishing in an instant. [[21225 旁白 angry]]
Although Lin Fangya didn't know how Chi Xiaocheng got hurt, she didn't show any fear in front of Su Tao and gave a cold smile, "What, are you angry? Come and hit me!" [[21226 林芳雅 angry]]
"If you dare to hit me, then..." [[21227 林芳雅 angry]]
"Slap—!" [[21228 旁白 neutral]]
A loud slap echoed through the hall before she could finish her sentence. [[21229 旁白 neutral]]
