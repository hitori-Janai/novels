Chapter 158: Since she left, there is only darkness ahead [[13883 旁白 neutral]]
"Huh... huh?" [[13884 苏桃 sad]]
"No... that can't be right. Xiaocheng... Xiaocheng is dead?" [[13885 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao lowered her head, looking at her trembling hands, and subconsciously murmured Chi Xiaocheng's name. [[13886 旁白 sad]]
Her gaze swept restlessly around the hospital, like a mental patient with strange eyes. She held her head tightly with both hands, her dark pupils darting up and down. [[13887 旁白 sad]]
It was as if she was afraid of something, yet also searching for something. [[13888 旁白 sad]]
Images in her mind flickered between Chi Xiaocheng's smile and her face after death. [[13889 旁白 sad]]
Because of the pain, she had chosen to forget. [[13890 旁白 neutral]]
But now, the memories were forced back into her mind. [[13891 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng had been very quiet after her suicide attempt. Su Tao only felt relief for her survival, but she never considered that if Chi Xiaocheng had written such a suicide note, she wouldn't have acted as normal as before. [[13892 旁白 sad]]
The three days in the "dark room," she had treated it as a simple game, thinking that just by being there, things would return to normal. [[13893 旁白 sad]]
But she never thought that since Chi Xiaocheng could say the words "dark room" so calmly, her mental state was already not quite right. [[13894 旁白 sad]]
Having to say "I like you" every day was a reflection of her obsession. Su Tao only saw it as the source of her own pain, not realizing it was Chi Xiaocheng's way of trying to keep her. [[13895 旁白 sad]]
One dream after another had told her that forcing a different ending with Xiaocheng would lead to a "bad ending," but she still didn't care. [[13896 旁白 sad]]
Si Chen and Dongfang Yang had both told her to accept her, to force herself to love her. [[13897 旁白 neutral]]
But what she did instead was run away. [[13898 旁白 sad]]
In the end, she didn't want to run anymore, but she... would never hear it. [[13899 旁白 sad]]
The scene froze on the final moment, with Chi Xiaocheng resting in her arms, lying in a pool of bright red orange juice, like a long river woven from spider lily petals. [[13900 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao was on one side of the river, while Chi Xiaocheng had already stepped onto the Bridge of Helplessness, which was covered in flowers. [[13901 旁白 sad]]
No matter how she called out, even with the long-awaited confession, the person she cared for so much did not turn back. [[13902 旁白 sad]]
Only her tea-brown hair fluttered in the wind. [[13903 旁白 sad]]
Memories turned into petals, gently brushing past Chi Xiaocheng's hair, carrying the beauty of the past as they fell upon Su Tao. [[13904 旁白 sad]]
As Chi Xiaocheng walked step by step towards the other side of the bridge, the bright red spider lily petals gradually dimmed and withered. [[13905 旁白 sad]]
Since she left, there was only darkness ahead. [[13906 旁白 sad]]
After regret and collapse came the inability to accept this reality. [[13907 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao looked up at Professor Su, and tears streamed down her face again. [[13908 旁白 sad]]
As she cried, she started to laugh. "Professor Su, Xiaocheng said she would never leave me, right?" [[13909 苏桃 sad]]
Professor Su was silent. [[13910 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao walked closer and punched Professor Su on the shoulder, but she was too weak to use any force. Her soft fist fell, and her body couldn't help but lean against the professor. [[13911 旁白 sad]]
She sobbed continuously, "Please, Professor Su... tell me this is all fake. Tell me it's just a joke, a prank by you and Xiaocheng... please... I'm begging you..." [[13912 苏桃 sad]]
Her mind hadn't collapsed from the overwhelming information, but the emotions she instinctively protected couldn't face such terrible news. [[13913 旁白 neutral]]
"Where is Xiaocheng?" [[13914 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao pushed Professor Su away and walked towards the door. [[13915 旁白 neutral]]
"Professor Su, tell me where Xiaocheng is!" [[13916 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao reached the doorway, stumbling and holding onto the frame. "I have to find her. I have to find her. I can't be gone when she wakes up. I must be with her..." [[13917 苏桃 sad]]
However, as soon as she stepped out, Su Tao saw Dongfang Yang standing in front of her. [[13918 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she was about to grasp at this last straw, Dongfang Yang shouted at her, "Su Tao, can you get a grip!" [[13919 东方阳 angry]]
"Chi Xiaocheng died to protect you! She wanted you to live a good life, and what are you doing?" [[13920 东方阳 angry]]
"You ran from her when she was alive, and now you can't accept her death. Look at yourself. How are you any different from those crazy women outside?" [[13921 东方阳 angry]]
Dongfang Yang suddenly grabbed Su Tao's shoulders forcefully and yelled, "What are you trying to do now? Kill yourself to find Chi Xiaocheng? You can't even take care of yourself. What right do you have to face her in the afterlife?" [[13922 东方阳 angry]]
"The person who killed Chi Xiaocheng is still out there, probably enjoying wine and women somewhere. Shouldn't you be getting revenge for her?" [[13923 东方阳 angry]]
Perhaps Dongfang Yang's words struck a chord with Su Tao. For Chi Xiaocheng's sake, she had to live on. [[13924 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe it was the word "revenge" that got to her. [[13925 旁白 neutral]]
The girl, who had been on the verge of collapsing, gradually quieted down. [[13926 旁白 neutral]]
Her arms fell limply to her sides, and she remained silent for a long time. [[13927 旁白 sad]]
After confirming that Su Tao's emotions had stabilized, Dongfang Yang let her go. "Are you still going to run from reality? Chi Xiaocheng is dead. She died to protect you. Running away will only make it impossible for her to rest in peace. What good will it do?" [[13928 东方阳 angry]]
Su Tao lowered her head and asked in a hoarse voice, "Where is Xiaocheng?" [[13929 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang let out a breath, turned, and pointed ahead. "First room around the corner at the end of the hall." [[13930 东方阳 neutral]]
That was where her body was being kept. [[13931 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao finally stopped making a scene and just limped in the direction Dongfang Yang had pointed. [[13932 旁白 sad]]
It seemed her "soul" had still not returned. [[13933 旁白 sad]]
Professor Su came out of the room and sighed. "It will be very difficult for her to recover. The one who tied the bell must be the one to untie it, but the one who tied it is gone." [[13934 苏教授 sad]]
Dongfang Yang looked helpless and pained. "Look at her condition. How can I become her emotional support as you suggested before? Right now, we can only hope that hatred will restore some of her spirit." [[13935 东方阳 sad]]
"At the very least, she needs to get her health back first." [[13936 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su was silent for a moment. "Actually, when Miss Su woke up, she had selective amnesia and had forgotten about Miss Chi's death. But I told her directly. Would it have been better to hide it from her for a while?" [[13937 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at Professor Su. "You're the doctor. Aren't you sure?" [[13938 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su had a complicated expression. "Whether it's bitterness before sweetness or sweetness before bitterness, as long as there is still sweetness, there's a choice. But for Miss Su, there is only bitterness left. I was thinking, why leave this pain for the future?" [[13939 苏教授 sad]]
Reality has to be faced sooner or later. [[13940 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Su Tao stood stunned in front of a hospital room door, staring blankly at Chi Xiaocheng, who was lying in bed, almost covered with various medical instruments. [[13941 旁白 sad]]
She glanced at the monitor on the side. The electrocardiogram showed a flat line. [[13942 旁白 sad]]
But the doctors, whether to comfort her or because they hadn't truly given up, still had some life-support machines attached to Chi Xiaocheng. [[13943 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if to tell her that although the flat line indicated death, there was still a chance to save her. [[13944 旁白 sad]]
What an absurd, ridiculous joke. [[13945 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao brought a small stool and sat by Chi Xiaocheng's bedside. [[13946 旁白 sad]]
With trembling hands, she couldn't help but hold that delicate little hand. [[13947 旁白 sad]]
It was cold, almost without any warmth. [[13948 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao held it very tightly, with a lot of force. [[13949 旁白 sad]]
She wanted to transfer a trace of warmth to her. [[13950 旁白 sad]]
But no matter what she did, the person on the bed showed no reaction. [[13951 旁白 sad]]
In the end, only tears fell drop by drop onto the back of that delicate hand. [[13952 旁白 sad]]
And then slid to the floor. [[13953 旁白 sad]]
"Xiaocheng..." Su Tao reached out and kissed the back of her hand, sobbing again. "I miss you. Please wake up, okay?" [[13954 苏桃 sad]]
She, too, had to face this reality. [[13955 旁白 sad]]
