Chapter 107: She is cute and warm when she is well-behaved. [[9293 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Chi Xiaocheng looked over. [[9294 旁白 neutral]]
A dark version of Chi Xiaocheng sat on the sofa, her hands folded on her lap. She leaned back gracefully, wearing a black formal dress that made her look like a young noble lady. [[9295 旁白 neutral]]
However, the playful smile on her face slowly turned into a mocking one. [[9296 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng spacing out, Su Tao followed her gaze toward the sofa and asked, "Xiaocheng, what are you looking at?" [[9297 苏桃 neutral]]
Meeting Su Tao's gaze, the dark Chi Xiaocheng smiled and waved. [[9298 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng swallowed and asked slowly, "Taotao, I think I see a figure on the sofa. Do you see it?" [[9299 池小橙 sad]]
"A figure?" [[9300 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao frowned and looked again. "There's no one there." [[9301 苏桃 neutral]]
She looked at Chi Xiaocheng again, a hint of worry in her eyes. [[9302 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked, and the dark Chi Xiaocheng, who had just waved at Su Tao, was gone. [[9303 旁白 neutral]]
She let out a breath and rubbed her forehead. "I probably just didn't sleep well because of a nightmare last night. I'm fine." [[9304 池小橙 neutral]]
"That's good." [[9305 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao added, "Remember to take your medicine after breakfast. We don't want any side effects from that makeup they put on your face last time." [[9306 苏桃 neutral]]
"No problem~" [[9307 池小橙 happy]]
Seeing her response, Su Tao started to eat her porridge with a sense of relief. [[9308 旁白 neutral]]
Taking Chi Xiaocheng to get a prescription was partly to prevent her skin from getting worse, but the medicine also contained supplements to help calm her emotions and mind. [[9309 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't tell her the details, but the treatment could not be delayed. [[9310 旁白 neutral]]
After a simple breakfast, Su Tao received a message from Chen Qian, just as she expected. [[9311 旁白 neutral]]
The strict professor for the 8 AM class had called roll, and their friends' attempt to cover for them had failed. The professor had written their names down. [[9312 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed helplessly. [[9313 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up. "Taotao, what's wrong?" [[9314 池小橙 neutral]]
"It's nothing. I just got marked down for skipping class." [[9315 苏桃 sad]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng lowered her small head. "I'm sorry." [[9316 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao didn't blame her. Instead, she asked, "By the way, Xiaocheng, you haven't been to class for many days. Aren't you worried you'll fail many subjects in the final exams?" [[9317 苏桃 neutral]]
It was early December, and the semester was already halfway over. [[9318 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's expression froze for a moment, and she guiltily turned her head away. "I don't want to go to class." [[9319 池小橙 sad]]
In her past life, classes were boring, and she didn't make any friends. She wanted to go even less in this life. [[9320 旁白 neutral]]
It was a waste of time. [[9321 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao rested her chin on her hand and asked, "So what do you do when you're not in class?" [[9322 苏桃 neutral]]
"I help Dongfang Yang at the cafe." [[9323 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao raised an eyebrow. "What else?" [[9324 苏桃 neutral]]
"I also read sometimes." [[9325 池小橙 neutral]]
They were all books about psychology. [[9326 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao noticed Chi Xiaocheng was being secretive and pressed on, "You must have a lot of free time if you don't go to class. Dongfang Yang doesn't say much even if you don't go to his cafe." [[9327 苏桃 neutral]]
Being questioned like this, Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head even more. "The rest of the time... I was either in the hospital or figuring out how to make money." [[9328 池小橙 sad]]
In the hospital. [[9329 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing those words, Su Tao stopped her questioning. [[9330 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking back, she realized that Chi Xiaocheng spent as much time in the hospital as she did out of it. [[9331 旁白 neutral]]
Frequent follow-up visits were also normal for her. [[9332 旁白 neutral]]
She pressed her lips together and changed the subject. "Alright, let's not talk about this. The snow outside doesn't seem too heavy. Let's go for a walk." [[9333 苏桃 neutral]]
"Don't you have to go to class?" [[9334 池小橙 neutral]]
"I've already skipped. Class isn't as important as you are." [[9335 苏桃 happy]]
Hearing this, a sweet feeling spread through Chi Xiaocheng's heart, and she immediately ran to her room. "I'll go change my clothes." [[9336 池小橙 happy]]
A sweet feeling also grew in Su Tao's heart. [[9337 旁白 happy]]
This was what she wanted: a cute and obedient Xiaocheng. [[9338 旁白 happy]]
If only she could stay this cute and innocent forever, without turning into a yandere. [[9339 旁白 sad]]
Going out for a walk to relax was also a form of therapy. [[9340 旁白 neutral]]
The most important thing was to be with her. [[9341 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, Chi Xiaocheng came out of her room. Her small frame was hidden inside a fluffy white coat, with soft fox fur trimming the collar and cuffs, making it look both fluffy and a little luxurious. [[9342 旁白 neutral]]
She wore thick cotton socks and a pair of brown snow boots, which had decorative bows tied at the ankles, a detail designed for girls. [[9343 旁白 neutral]]
A light blue scarf was wrapped gently around her neck, and she wore a knit hat with a pom-pom on top. The tassels of the hat swayed gently, and along with the scarf, seemed to try to hide her cute face. [[9344 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes lit up. "Xiaocheng, did you buy new clothes?" [[9345 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled shyly. "My brother bought them for me. The coat is a little big, though." [[9346 池小橙 happy]]
The large coat made Chi Xiaocheng look even smaller. [[9347 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't help but reach out and pat her head, praising her, "Cute." [[9348 苏桃 happy]]
"But why aren't you wearing gloves? It's very cold outside." [[9349 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng held out her small, fair hand and spread her fingers. "I don't need them. Holding Taotao's hand will keep me warm too." [[9350 池小橙 happy]]
"I really can't win with you." [[9351 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao took a glove out of her pocket. "Wear one of mine." [[9352 苏桃 neutral]]
"What about the other one?" [[9353 池小橙 neutral]]
"I'll hold your other hand." [[9354 苏桃 happy]]
Her intention was obvious, but Su Tao didn't mind. [[9355 旁白 happy]]
Ever since Chi Xiaocheng ate the special soft candy, her skin had become better and better. [[9356 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao never wanted to let go of her smooth little hand whenever she held it. [[9357 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao opened an umbrella, and the two of them walked out. [[9358 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but ask, "Taotao, where are we going?" [[9359 池小橙 neutral]]
"Let's go to that cat cafe we talked about last time." [[9360 苏桃 happy]]
They were continuing their date that had been interrupted by Ye Liang. [[9361 旁白 neutral]]
This time, their outing went smoothly. [[9362 旁白 neutral]]
The two walked for a while and soon arrived at the cat cafe. [[9363 旁白 neutral]]
As Su Tao closed the umbrella, Chi Xiaocheng breathed out a puff of warm air. She was about to shake off the snow on her clothes but realized she didn't have a single flake on her. [[9364 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Su Tao, after closing the umbrella, patted the light snow off her shoulder and stepped forward to push the door open. "Come in, Xiaocheng. It's still really cold out here." [[9365 苏桃 happy]]
She leaned against the door, holding it open like a maid waiting on her young mistress. [[9366 旁白 neutral]]
You can often tell a person's character from the small details. [[9367 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's thoughtfulness was never obvious. [[9368 旁白 neutral]]
The longer they were together, the more Chi Xiaocheng felt that care in every aspect of her life. [[9369 旁白 happy]]
She squinted her eyes happily and walked into the cat cafe. [[9370 池小橙 happy]]
With a jingle of a bell and a wave of warm air, a girl's voice came from inside, "Welcome to Yangyang Cat Cafe~" [[9371 陌生女1 happy]]
Looking up, she saw three girls, each holding a different breed of cat while reading and doing problems. [[9372 旁白 neutral]]
"Not many people come here in this weather." [[9373 陌生女1 neutral]]
One of the girls commented, then walked over to Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao while holding a cat. "What would you two like to drink? If you're just stopping by to rest, you can have a free cup of coffee." [[9374 陌生女1 happy]]
Su Tao looked at the price list on the side. [[9375 旁白 neutral]]
It was 30 yuan to play with the cats for an hour. [[9376 旁白 neutral]]
For 100 yuan, you could stay all day, with free perks like power outlets, snacks, and coffee. [[9377 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pointed to a nearby sign curiously. "This place is quite remote. Can you really make a profit with these prices?" [[9378 苏桃 neutral]]
The girl holding the cat smiled. "The young master said he opened this cafe for fun, so it doesn't matter if it makes money. If you two like cats, you can adopt any of the cats here for free." [[9379 陌生女1 happy]]
Essentially, this place was a rescue shelter for stray cats. [[9380 旁白 neutral]]
After the stray cats were tamed and cared for, they were given to true cat lovers, giving the kittens a home. [[9381 旁白 neutral]]
Yangyang Cat Cafe. That guy Dongfang Yang really is bad at naming things. [[9382 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had always wanted to have a cat, but her dorm didn't allow it. [[9383 旁白 neutral]]
She was tempted and looked at Chi Xiaocheng. "What do you think, Xiaocheng?" [[9384 苏桃 neutral]]
She turned to her side and saw Chi Xiaocheng looking around. She waved a hand in front of her eyes. "Xiaocheng?" [[9385 苏桃 neutral]]
"Huh?" Chi Xiaocheng came back to her senses. "What did you say, Taotao?" [[9386 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao asked, puzzled, "You really weren't listening to me. What are you looking for?" [[9387 苏桃 neutral]]
What was she looking for? [[9388 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, it was the dark version of herself in the black dress who would occasionally appear somewhere nearby. [[9389 旁白 sad]]
