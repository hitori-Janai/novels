Chapter 229: The Choice You Made, Was It the Right One? [[19715 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, to make Xiaocheng no longer a yandere, to make her a normal person, and thus live a normal life with her. [[19716 旁白 neutral]]
Isn't this what I've always hoped for? [[19717 苏桃 neutral]]
From the time after the dark room incident until Xiaocheng was shot and died, Su Tao felt that she had taken the wrong path again and again. [[19718 旁白 neutral]]
This wrong path was to escape Xiaocheng's yandere nature, while comforting herself by saying that everything was for the sake of curing her, and in doing so, doing various things that hurt her. [[19719 旁白 neutral]]
It was only in the last two weeks that she truly understood that Xiaocheng had a yandere side, but also a cute side. [[19720 旁白 neutral]]
Since she enjoyed her cuteness, she shouldn't run away from her yandere side. [[19721 旁白 neutral]]
Curing her? Su Tao hadn't even thought about it recently. [[19722 旁白 neutral]]
But now, the chance to cure her was right in front of her. [[19723 旁白 neutral]]
Within her grasp! [[19724 旁白 neutral]]
This might even be the only chance in her lifetime! [[19725 旁白 neutral]]
Her breathing quickened. The metal phone case was incredibly cold, yet Su Tao felt as if hot blood was surging out with the words on her phone, and into her body. [[19726 旁白 neutral]]
If it's really as Chengcheng said, what will the future be like? [[19727 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao wasn't the type with a vivid imagination. [[19728 旁白 neutral]]
If she was asked to imagine a future where Xiaocheng was no longer a yandere, what came to mind were memories from her childhood. [[19729 旁白 neutral]]
Memories from middle and high school, before their falling out. [[19730 旁白 neutral]]
I didn't understand Xiaocheng's feelings, but maybe she already liked me a little back then? [[19731 苏桃 neutral]]
If her yandere side is gone, will she return to her old self? [[19732 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao just held her phone like that, letting the cold wind redden her ears. [[19733 旁白 neutral]]
She stood still, like an ice sculpture. [[19734 旁白 neutral]]
Her beautiful eyes seemed to lose focus as she stared at the words on the screen, lost in thought. [[19735 旁白 neutral]]
Many of Chi Xiaocheng's smiles flashed through her mind. [[19736 旁白 neutral]]
After the smiles came the blood dripping from the corner of her lips, a series of terrifying, suffocating images. [[19737 旁白 neutral]]
The basement. [[19738 旁白 neutral]]
The rooftop. [[19739 旁白 neutral]]
The dark room. [[19740 旁白 neutral]]
The snowy road when she broke up with Ye Liang. [[19741 旁白 neutral]]
The images flashed by like an old film reel with a "click-clack" sound, finally freezing on the moment before her death. [[19742 旁白 neutral]]
Not the look of satisfaction when she was shot. [[19743 旁白 neutral]]
But... the things she said during their last argument. [[19744 旁白 neutral]]
She hurt Sister Long, caused a scene at school, and stood up for me in front of my advisor. [[19745 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, she was disrupting my life, creating one scary scene after another. Such a person was undoubtedly a yandere. [[19746 旁白 neutral]]
But everything she did, all her yandere actions, wasn't it all for me? [[19747 旁白 neutral]]
"Without that suffocating love, would she still be the Xiaocheng I know?" [[19748 苏桃 sad]]
When Su Tao came back to her senses, she heard herself whisper these words. [[19749 旁白 neutral]]
The evening wind still blew from behind, messing up her ponytail. The cold felt like it could blow away the fog in her mind. [[19750 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, an old man's voice came from beside her. "Child, what are you thinking about?" [[19751 老大爷 neutral]]
Hearing the voice, Su Tao realized that while she was lost in thought, a patient from the next room seemed to have come out. [[19752 旁白 neutral]]
It was an old man. Su Tao noticed his bandaged eyes and the white cane in his hand. [[19753 旁白 neutral]]
The old man was blind. [[19754 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao put away her phone for a moment and smiled at the old man. "Oh, nothing much. Just chatting with a friend." [[19755 苏桃 neutral]]
The old man was blind, but his hearing was sharp. He had come out to enjoy the evening breeze, but he was startled by the whisper he had just heard, and he had heard it clearly. [[19756 旁白 neutral]]
Wanting to find someone to talk to, the old man said, "If something is bothering you, you can tell me about it. It's a bit lonely to be out here in the wind by myself." [[19757 老大爷 neutral]]
Su Tao was a little confused, the thoughts that had just surfaced were still conflicting with her memories of the old Xiaocheng. [[19758 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but say, "My story might be a bit long, Grandpa. Do you want to hear it?" [[19759 苏桃 neutral]]
The old man tapped the floor with his white cane and nodded gently. [[19760 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment of thought, Su Tao told him the story of her and Chi Xiaocheng. [[19761 旁白 neutral]]
Only in her version, her and Chi Xiaocheng's love story became a story of family affection. [[19762 旁白 neutral]]
Her yandere nature became a mental illness. [[19763 旁白 neutral]]
Her extreme actions were only because she was too dependent on her "older sister," not because she loved her to the point of madness. [[19764 旁白 neutral]]
She had to consider the old man's ability to understand. [[19765 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, she voiced her confusion. "The doctor told me that if my friend keeps her amnesia, her mental illness will be gone. But if I wake up her past memories, her mental illness might never be cured." [[19766 苏桃 sad]]
The old man didn't make a sound to interrupt Su Tao. After she finished, he asked softly, "The 'doctor' you mentioned, is he really a doctor?" [[19767 老大爷 neutral]]
Su Tao was at a loss for words, she shyly twirled a lock of her hair with her index finger. "Well... actually, a friend of mine told me that." [[19768 苏桃 neutral]]
The old man smiled kindly. "Then your friend is actually wrong." [[19769 老大爷 neutral]]
"Wrong?" [[19770 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes." The old man replied. "Memory is not something you can control. Even if you don't help her regain her memories, maybe one day she'll have a dream, or experience something very shocking." [[19771 老大爷 neutral]]
"And then she might remember things from the past. It's not impossible." [[19772 老大爷 neutral]]
"To put it more directly, unless your sister moves to a new environment and has no contact with anyone she knew before, she will regain her memory sooner or later." [[19773 老大爷 neutral]]
"If she encounters any major event that could shock her mentally, she might recover her memory." [[19774 老大爷 neutral]]
The old man said, "If you're not in a hurry, why don't you listen to my son's story?" [[19775 老大爷 neutral]]
His son was a firefighter. On a mission when he was 20, he saved a girl from a sea of fire. [[19776 旁白 neutral]]
The fire was started by a desperate criminal who had broken into her house to rob it. After killing her parents in front of her, the police arrived, and knowing he couldn't escape, he set the house on fire. [[19777 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to die and take the girl with him. [[19778 旁白 neutral]]
The fire was fierce. By the time his son found the girl, her head had been hit by a burning beam, and she had already passed out. [[19779 旁白 neutral]]
When she was rescued and woke up, perhaps because the events before she fainted were too painful, or because she was hit on the head by the beam, the girl had amnesia. Except for a vague impression of "home," she didn't remember anything from her past. [[19780 旁白 neutral]]
The girl was cheerful and strong. She actively cooperated with the treatment, hoping to go home one day. [[19781 旁白 neutral]]
But many things couldn't be hidden. After six months of treatment, she hadn't made a single phone call home, and her parents hadn't come to see her. All the information she got was from the doctor and his son. [[19782 旁白 neutral]]
She had amnesia, but she wasn't stupid. Realizing that something might have happened to her family, and with only a vague impression of home in her mind, she kept asking what had happened. [[19783 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, his son was faced with two choices. [[19784 旁白 neutral]]
Wake up her past memories. [[19785 旁白 neutral]]
Or create a fictional home for her. His son, a firefighter, even wanted to marry her and take care of her for the rest of his life to prevent her from remembering her painful past. [[19786 旁白 neutral]]
At this point, the old man turned towards the direction where Su Tao's voice had come from. [[19787 旁白 neutral]]
Even though his eyes were covered with a black cloth, it was as if he was looking at her. [[19788 旁白 neutral]]
"Child, if it were you, which one would you choose?" [[19789 老大爷 neutral]]
