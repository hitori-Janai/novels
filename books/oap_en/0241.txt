Chapter 241: She's Turning Abnormal [[20641 旁白 neutral]]
It was a new day, with only four days left until the New Year. [[20642 旁白 neutral]]
Although Chi Xiaocheng's memory confusion hadn't been resolved, Su Tao had noticed another problem with herself in the past few days. [[20643 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't hide her emotions. [[20644 旁白 neutral]]
Especially in front of Chi Xiaocheng, she couldn't control her expressions at all. When she felt down, it showed clearly on her face. [[20645 旁白 neutral]]
That was a bit too embarrassing. [[20646 旁白 neutral]]
So, she went to find Dongfang Yang early in the morning. [[20647 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Su Tao's question, Dongfang Yang asked in surprise, "You're saying you want to learn acting?" [[20648 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded seriously, "To be precise, I want to improve my acting skills. With Xiaocheng's memory loss, I always show my emotions because of things related to her." [[20649 苏桃 neutral]]
"Like when she's with Fang Ning, I know I shouldn't show any particular expression, but she feels distant from me now, right? When I see that, I always feel... a little jealous." [[20650 苏桃 sad]]
"I think, at the very least, I can't show this in front of Xiaocheng." [[20651 苏桃 sad]]
That's why it's necessary to improve my acting skills. I don't need to be amazing, just good enough that my facial expressions don't make Xiaocheng feel something is wrong and worry. [[20652 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang rubbed his chin, "It's not hard to hire someone to teach you, but this kind of thing really depends on talent. If you don't have a talent for acting, you might never learn it no matter how hard you try." [[20653 东方阳 neutral]]
"I want to try!" [[20654 苏桃 neutral]]
His serious expression let Dongfang Yang know that Su Tao wasn't joking, so he nodded, "Let's do it after the New Year then. I'll arrange a teacher for you. Do you want a crash course or to slowly learn the exquisite skills of a master?" [[20655 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao thought for a moment, "A crash course will be fine. I don't plan to pursue this in the future, so learning a part of it should be enough." [[20656 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay!" [[20657 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang nodded lightly and changed the subject, "By the way, are you two going home for the New Year? There are only four days left, have you decided?" [[20658 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips, "Actually... we haven't decided yet. I'm not sure about Xiaocheng's physical condition. Professor Su said that even with IV drips at the hospital, it would take a long time, right?" [[20659 苏桃 sad]]
"There's no other way. Her body has been weak for almost half a month. It's impossible to get high-speed rail tickets now. Even if I lent you a car, I'm afraid you'd be stuck in traffic for three days and two nights." [[20660 东方阳 neutral]]
News about traffic jams on the highway was everywhere. [[20661 旁白 neutral]]
As the New Year approached, everyone wanted to go home. This time of year was always a frenzy of traffic jams. [[20662 旁白 neutral]]
"Unless I fly you back myself." [[20663 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's suggestion made Su Tao sweat a little. "Well, we... let's see." [[20664 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang: "If you don't plan on going back so soon, how about attending a banquet with us the day after tomorrow?" [[20665 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao was taken aback for a moment, "Us?" [[20666 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes, I plan to have Chi Xiaocheng attend as well." [[20667 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang explained the nature of the banquet to her, "This banquet is actually for the upper class of Jiuzhou City. It's held once a year to determine who will remain in Jiuzhou City next year." [[20668 东方阳 neutral]]
"For those who want to enter the circle, leave it, or confirm the top positions. It's different from last time. The people attending this time are all of my status, only about thirty to fifty people at most." [[20669 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao was still confused, "But even if I go, why should Xiaocheng go too? She hasn't even recovered." [[20670 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's the same idea as last time," Dongfang Yang explained. "As my sister, you will receive my protection, and Chi Xiaocheng can stand on stage with Si Chen." [[20671 东方阳 neutral]]
"Those who still want to cause trouble will have to reconsider, facing the combined power of my Dongfang family and the Si family." [[20672 东方阳 neutral]]
He had thought a lot about how to better protect Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng. [[20673 旁白 neutral]]
How could they eliminate assassinations like the last one? [[20674 旁白 neutral]]
The best way was to get rid of all the enemies! [[20675 旁白 neutral]]
But right now, there was still no news about Xiao Ming and Lin Fangya. Their situation was uncertain, and it was unknown if there were still others targeting the two of them. [[20676 旁白 neutral]]
In that case, let the most powerful forces in Jiuzhou City back them up! [[20677 旁白 neutral]]
Moreover, their joint appearance might lure out some big fish who were hiding in the shadows. [[20678 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao thinking, Dongfang Yang added, "Of course, it still depends on Chi Xiaocheng's physical condition. If you don't agree, I won't force you. But after the banquet, I have to go back to the capital." [[20679 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao was startled, "You're going back?" [[20680 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes, I'm the only young master of the Dongfang family after all. How can I not go back for the New Year? I probably won't be back until after the seventh day of the New Year. If you're not planning to go back to your hometown, it's best to attend this banquet." [[20681 东方阳 neutral]]
He would leave people behind to protect them, but he wouldn't be able to handle things immediately as before. [[20682 旁白 neutral]]
He even had the idea of taking both of them to the capital with him. [[20683 旁白 neutral]]
But then he remembered that it was Ye Liang's home base. Although the person was dead, the Ye family would not let them go. [[20684 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao thought for a long time and replied, "I'll ask Xiaocheng what she thinks. After all, right now, she can't even eat anything with strong flavors." [[20685 苏桃 neutral]]
Another banquet... [[20686 旁白 neutral]]
She had no thoughts on it; her mind was completely filled with things related to Chi Xiaocheng. [[20687 旁白 neutral]]
She had even been neglecting her recent studies and exercise. [[20688 旁白 neutral]]
In the evening, Su Tao got herself a copy of "An Actor Prepares" and began to study it systematically. [[20689 旁白 neutral]]
She thought that if acting skills were divided into four levels—beginner, intermediate, advanced, and master—it should be enough for her to learn a little and reach an intermediate level. [[20690 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she wouldn't always show that annoyingly disappointed expression in front of Xiaocheng. [[20691 旁白 neutral]]
After meeting with two psychologists and asking about Chi Xiaocheng's condition, she went back to her room to sleep. [[20692 旁白 neutral]]
Watching her leave, Dr. Chen and Dr. Lin looked at each other, both showing a hint of worry. [[20693 旁白 neutral]]
"This girl is having some small problems too." Dr. Chen took off his white gloves, his eyes revealing a sense of helplessness. [[20694 陈医生 sad]]
Dr. Lin nodded, "It's been almost a week since we let her decide whether to wake up Miss Chi. This can't be explained by just being slow." [[20695 林医生 neutral]]
Dr. Chen: "Actually, you and I both know. I'm wondering if I should tell Miss Su about her own situation." [[20696 陈医生 neutral]]
Dr. Lin naturally knew Su Tao's current state. The Su Tao she first met was confident and decisive. After experiencing Chi Xiaocheng's "death," she seemed to have lost her confidence. [[20697 旁白 neutral]]
She started to dislike herself and became hesitant in many things, torn between not wanting Chi Xiaocheng to get hurt and wanting to return to their former relationship. [[20698 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know how to achieve the outcome she hoped for. [[20699 旁白 neutral]]
They were psychologists; it was certainly no problem to guide Su Tao a little. [[20700 旁白 neutral]]
But according to Young Master Si Chen's plan... [[20701 旁白 neutral]]
Let her continue to struggle. [[20702 旁白 neutral]]
Like an inflating balloon, a growing prize pool—the more it expands, the better. [[20703 旁白 neutral]]
So she turned her gaze and said faintly to Dr. Chen, "Let's not get too involved. Let's just do our part. If it backfires, we'll just cause more trouble for the young masters, and we can't be fully responsible for this matter anyway." [[20704 林医生 neutral]]
Dr. Chen pursed his lips and sighed, "You're right." [[20705 陈医生 sad]]
But the worry in his brow did not lessen. [[20706 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was already a very troublesome patient. He had a faint feeling that this Miss Su Tao was also about to become abnormal. [[20707 旁白 neutral]]
