Chapter 47 Since You're Already Here (Bonus Chapter) [[4044 旁白 neutral]]
Cold wind silently swept through the winter campus. Dry branches swayed in the wind, making faint rustling sounds. [[4045 旁白 neutral]]
Stepping out of the dormitory, Su Tao clearly felt that the sky was even gloomier than she had imagined. [[4046 旁白 neutral]]
Beneath her thick gray tights, her boots crunched on the accumulated snow. Su Tao's gaze swept over the passersby, occasionally meeting the admiring glances of some girls. [[4047 旁白 neutral]]
Popular with both genders. [[4048 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't help but recall what Si Chen had told her. [[4049 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, she would never have misunderstood these glances. [[4050 旁白 neutral]]
But now, she couldn't ignore them. [[4051 旁白 neutral]]
Because one of those girls was Chi Xiaocheng. [[4052 旁白 neutral]]
Was it her acting as a yandere? [[4053 旁白 neutral]]
Or was it truly as Si Chen said, that the misunderstanding between her and me caused her to become a real yandere? [[4054 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't figure it out. [[4055 旁白 neutral]]
But the answer should be revealed today. [[4056 旁白 neutral]]
She first went to see her counselor, took three days off, and then went to find Ye Liang. [[4057 旁白 neutral]]
She took a taxi to the bottom of his company building. [[4058 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Su." The security guard recognized Su Tao and bowed slightly, "Are you here to see Young Master?" [[4059 保安 neutral]]
"Is Ye Liang free now?" [[4060 苏桃 neutral]]
"I'm very sorry, Miss Su." The security guard replied, "Due to some unexpected circumstances, Young Master flew to Lizhi City last night and won't be back until tomorrow at the earliest." [[4061 保安 neutral]]
"Young Master asked me to tell you that the agreed-upon matter will be postponed for now, and he'll contact you when he's free." [[4062 保安 neutral]]
Su Tao frowned slightly and pressed, "What happened?" [[4063 苏桃 neutral]]
The security guard shook his head, "Young Master didn't tell me, he just asked you to wait." [[4064 保安 neutral]]
"This guy..." Su Tao kicked the snow under her feet in dissatisfaction, pouted, and swallowed her displeasure. [[4065 旁白 neutral]]
She said to the security guard, "Then I won't bother you. If Ye Liang comes back, please ask him to call me." [[4066 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes, Miss Su." [[4067 保安 neutral]]
Bidding farewell to the security guard, Su Tao thought it over and still felt annoyed. She bent down and rolled up a snowball. [[4068 旁白 neutral]]
As if the snowball was Ye Liang, she threw it heavily against the wall. [[4069 旁白 neutral]]
"Both of them are so self-willed, they don't understand how to be considerate at all." [[4070 苏桃 angry]]
Last time at the cruise banquet, she was the one who broke the appointment first, causing Ye Liang to waste a lot of money and connections. The compensation of being his maid for three days was also at his strong request, and Su Tao had no choice but to agree. [[4071 旁白 neutral]]
For these three days. [[4072 旁白 neutral]]
She had to humble herself and switch shifts with colleagues at her part-time job, working overtime. [[4073 旁白 neutral]]
She gave her school counselor a lot of excuses and signed a guarantee before being granted leave. [[4074 旁白 neutral]]
She also had to deal with the occasional gossip. [[4075 旁白 neutral]]
She even had to hide it from Chi Xiaocheng, begging everyone she knew not to reveal this matter. [[4076 旁白 neutral]]
Coupled with the mental pressure from this yandere loli, Su Tao hadn't slept well for several nights. [[4077 旁白 neutral]]
She originally planned to use this opportunity to test Chi Xiaocheng. [[4078 旁白 neutral]]
If she was really a yandere, then she would listen to Doctor Cheng and try to appease her. [[4079 旁白 neutral]]
If she wasn't a yandere, and it was all an act, then after they clarified things, she would go and be Ye Liang's maid. [[4080 旁白 neutral]]
But now, he just left. [[4081 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao put her phone in her pocket and sighed deeply, "Forget it, this is fine too. I'll focus on Xiaocheng. If she's really a yandere and reacts to what I say..." [[4082 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao recalled the scene when she was coaxing Chi Xiaocheng in the hospital last time. [[4083 旁白 neutral]]
She murmured softly, "If I hug her and say some nice things, and then express my expectations, she'll go along with my wishes, right?" [[4084 苏桃 neutral]]
"Because she likes me, she'll listen to me?" [[4085 苏桃 neutral]]
"From what I've learned online, that's how it works." [[4086 苏桃 neutral]]
But Doctor Cheng said it was okay to try, so it must be fine! [[4087 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suppressed the uneasiness in her heart. [[4088 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the sky darken and rain about to fall, she hurried towards Chi Xiaocheng's neighborhood. [[4089 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom—" [[4090 旁白 neutral]]
A dull thunderclap sounded. Nearing the neighborhood, Su Tao looked up at the sky, covered her head, and started running. [[4091 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, rain, fall slower!" [[4092 苏桃 sad]]
She ran in with big strides, finally entering the building where Chi Xiaocheng lived just before the downpour. [[4093 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had barely stepped inside the building when the torrential rain began to pour down. [[4094 旁白 neutral]]
The strong wind seemed to want to drag her out of the building, blowing rain furiously through the door. [[4095 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Su Tao quickly retreated a few steps inside the building. [[4096 旁白 neutral]]
Her heart still pounding. [[4097 旁白 neutral]]
The rain came so suddenly and heavily that even with an umbrella, she would probably get half-soaked. [[4098 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, right, I should tell Si Chen." [[4099 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao turned around and walked towards the elevator, sending a message to Si Chen, "Si Chen, I'm going to Xiaocheng's house to try out that idea we talked about." [[4100 苏桃 neutral]]
"Don't go!!!" [[4101 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen replied instantly. [[4102 旁白 neutral]]
Three exclamation marks fully displayed the person's horror. [[4103 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao blinked in confusion, "Why? Did you already test it, Si Chen?" [[4104 苏桃 neutral]]
Last time, Si Chen proposed two methods. [[4105 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't agree to the first method, so Si Chen went to test it alone for her. [[4106 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao thought Si Chen hadn't acted yet because she hadn't heard from him. [[4107 旁白 neutral]]
By the time he replied, Su Tao had already stepped into the elevator. [[4108 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Uh... actually, I've already tested it. How should I put it, Chi Xiaocheng is indeed a bit of a yandere." [[4109 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen: "So you don't need to go. Stimulating her like that, it wouldn't be good if there was any danger." [[4110 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Is that so? I always feel like you're hiding something from me." [[4111 苏桃 neutral]]
The elevator door opened, and Su Tao slowly walked to Chi Xiaocheng's door, then glanced at the tightly closed window on the other side. [[4112 旁白 neutral]]
The strong wind and rain were like a large hand, anxiously slapping the window, as if telling her not to enter this door. [[4113 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen: "I'm worried about you." [[4114 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao lowered her head and typed, "It's fine, I'm already here." [[4115 苏桃 neutral]]
"If anything happens, call me again." [[4116 苏桃 neutral]]
After sending the last message to Si Chen, Su Tao stopped looking at her phone and put it in her pocket. [[4117 旁白 neutral]]
She used her index finger to tidy her bangs and pressed the doorbell. [[4118 旁白 neutral]]
"Ding-dong~" [[4119 旁白 neutral]]
The door opened, and a wisp of tea-colored hair playfully peeked out, followed by that adorably mischievous little face. [[4120 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed to be checking if the person outside was a bad guy, her small head peeking out just a little. [[4121 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that it was Su Tao, her face lit up with surprise, "Tao Tao!" [[4122 池小橙 happy]]
"Come in, come in, it's cold outside." [[4123 池小橙 happy]]
The joyful and sweet voice warmed Su Tao's heart. [[4124 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of those young masters who were quite close to her, their way of showing concern was just asking "Are you okay?" In comparison, Xiaocheng was simply an angel. [[4125 旁白 neutral]]
She looks so normal, how could she be a yandere? [[4126 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao tapped her boots and walked into the room, "Xiaocheng, the air conditioning is on, it's so warm." [[4127 苏桃 neutral]]
Because I knew you were coming today. [[4128 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled inwardly, not answering. Instead, she took out a pair of slippers, "Change your shoes first, then I'll pour you a cup of hot tea, Tao Tao. It must be cold outside with the wind and rain, right?" [[4129 池小橙 neutral]]
Without waiting for a reply, she took Su Tao's hand again, clasped it, and brought it to her mouth. [[4130 旁白 neutral]]
She gently exhaled a warm breath. [[4131 旁白 neutral]]
Her cute face looked up again, with that foolish yet satisfied smile, "Warm, isn't it?" [[4132 池小橙 happy]]
Looking at Chi Xiaocheng like this, Su Tao's heart suddenly ached. [[4133 旁白 neutral]]
She's so good to me. If I tell her about Ye Liang and the maid thing later, she'll probably be very sad, right? [[4134 旁白 neutral]]
It's a little... unbearable. [[4135 旁白 neutral]]
But no one knew whether this cute face was real or an act. [[4136 旁白 neutral]]
Is cuteness her true nature? [[4137 旁白 neutral]]
Or is yandere her true nature? [[4138 旁白 neutral]]
Sorry, Xiaocheng! [[4139 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's resolve hardened. Her small feet shuffled into the house in slippers. [[4140 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't notice Chi Xiaocheng standing by the door, a faint smile on her lips, pressing a button on the electronic lock. [[4141 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of gears turning echoed. [[4142 旁白 neutral]]
The door was locked. [[4143 旁白 neutral]]
