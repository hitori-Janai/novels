Chapter 203: The Goal Before Resurrection [[17772 旁白 neutral]]
When he found Su Tao again, the birthday banquet was already halfway over. She was sitting alone on a large decorative rock next to a garden path. [[17773 旁白 neutral]]
She was leaning back slightly, her legs together and one hand on her lap, quietly looking up at the brightest star in the sky. [[17774 旁白 neutral]]
The moonlight shone down, making the subtle star-like decorations on her purple dress twinkle softly. Her lonely and quiet beauty was captivating to watch. [[17775 旁白 neutral]]
However. [[17776 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how beautiful her side profile was, that was only for other people. [[17777 旁白 neutral]]
He, Si Chen, would never love Tao. [[17778 旁白 neutral]]
"Why are you here all alone? I've been looking for you for a long time. I couldn't find you anywhere in the main hall." [[17779 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao's slightly dazed eyes slowly came back into focus. She turned her stunningly beautiful face to look at Si Chen, smiling as she said, "I'm still not very used to such crowded places. I looked for Miracle Doctor Chu but couldn't find him, so I decided to just stay out here for a bit." [[17780 苏桃 happy]]
"That guy seems to be injured. He didn't even attend the banquet. If you ask me, you shouldn't even bother looking for him. I have a feeling his 'miracle doctor' title is mostly for show." [[17781 司辰 neutral]]
Anyway, Chi Xiaocheng was only in a state of suspended animation. When the time was right, she would come back on her own. [[17782 旁白 neutral]]
It was just that he couldn't tell Su Tao any of this. [[17783 旁白 neutral]]
But the young woman just shook her head gently, "Even if hope is slim, we should at least give it a try, shouldn't we? It's a shame I couldn't get his contact information." [[17784 苏桃 sad]]
What if he really had some skills and could wake Xiaocheng up? [[17785 旁白 neutral]]
Otherwise, according to what Dongfang Yang said. [[17786 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng might wake up in the future, but no one knew how long that would take. [[17787 旁白 neutral]]
Ten years, twenty years, or even thirty years. [[17788 旁白 neutral]]
Were all of these possible? [[17789 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe it was just an unusual reaction from her body, and she would never wake up at all. [[17790 旁白 neutral]]
After all, her heart had already stopped beating. [[17791 旁白 neutral]]
The appearance of this miracle doctor became a lifeline for someone who was drowning. [[17792 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone understood these words. The goal was Chi Xiaocheng, and the words were about her. [[17793 旁白 neutral]]
But once people have a bias, they see things through a negative filter. [[17794 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was playing the role of a doll, held motionlessly by Si Chen. [[17795 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's words were meant for her own good. [[17796 旁白 neutral]]
But with the precedent of the scene on the dance floor. [[17797 旁白 neutral]]
In her ears, it only sounded like Su Tao wanted to find that miracle doctor, Chu Lingfeng. [[17798 旁白 neutral]]
To get his contact information. [[17799 旁白 neutral]]
And then, to do something with him. [[17800 旁白 neutral]]
As for herself, she was just a doll, and there were some things she couldn't interfere with. [[17801 旁白 neutral]]
There were still more than ten days until she could be revived. It felt so long. [[17802 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but ask in her mind, "System, if my consciousness leaves this scarecrow and returns to my original body, will these ten-plus days pass in an instant for me?" [[17803 池小橙 neutral]]
[It will not.] [[17804 System neutral]]
"But it should be like sleeping. For someone who is awake, eight hours is so long, but after falling asleep, it's morning in an instant." [[17805 池小橙 neutral]]
The System explained patiently. [[17806 旁白 neutral]]
[As the host's body is repaired, if the host's consciousness returns to the body, you will be in a state of being awake but unable to open your eyes or make any movements. You can only experience the surrounding space through your senses.] [[17807 System neutral]]
That would be even harder to endure than the present situation. [[17808 旁白 neutral]]
The System didn't say that last sentence, but it could probably understand its host's feelings. [[17809 旁白 neutral]]
Usually, even when she was a scarecrow, watching her beloved Su Tao in the room, she would smile even if she was just sitting there motionless. [[17810 旁白 neutral]]
But it was this care and affection, along with the uncertainty of the future, that made her lack a sense of security. [[17811 旁白 neutral]]
And it was heavier than before her death. [[17812 旁白 neutral]]
Someone who has died once is more afraid of loss. [[17813 旁白 neutral]]
And she had died "twice." [[17814 旁白 neutral]]
While her thoughts were running wild, Si Chen had already extended his hand, passing her to Su Tao. "You should keep a better eye on your doll next time. After all, it's something she left behind. Losing it so easily isn't a sign of caring for her." [[17815 司辰 neutral]]
Even though this little thing had run off by itself. [[17816 旁白 neutral]]
But Si Chen still had to provide the assist. [[17817 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took the scarecrow in her hand, and a sense of comfort washed over her. She nodded firmly, "I won't lose it again. Thank you, Si Chen." [[17818 苏桃 happy]]
"You're welcome. The banquet is about to end, let's head back first." [[17819 司辰 neutral]]
"Okay." [[17820 苏桃 neutral]]
The two of them walked together under the moonlight, a handsome man and a beautiful woman. [[17821 旁白 neutral]]
To outsiders, they should have been a perfect match, yet Si Chen always kept a slight distance from Su Tao. [[17822 旁白 neutral]]
They chatted casually along the way and encountered several more bodyguards who were still busy searching for the assassin. [[17823 旁白 neutral]]
Just as they were about to return to the main banquet hall, the already-bandaged Chu Lingfeng came over, limping with several people. [[17824 旁白 neutral]]
When Su Tao saw Chu Lingfeng, her face lit up with joy. "Miracle Doctor Chu! I've been looking for you for so long, but I couldn't find you. You..." [[17825 苏桃 happy]]
She looked doubtfully at the bandage wrapped around half of Chu Lingfeng's face and the obvious fist mark on his right cheek. Her delight turned to confusion, "Are you okay?" [[17826 苏桃 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao's expression change from delight to concern, Chu Lingfeng felt a sense of relief. [[17827 旁白 neutral]]
His gaze fell on the scarecrow at her waist. [[17828 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed this girl wasn't the mastermind; she had likely been used by someone behind the scenes. [[17829 旁白 neutral]]
He forced a smile. "Miss Su, thank you for your concern. I came here mainly to ask if you would be willing to part with the doll at your waist." [[17830 楚凌风 neutral]]
As soon as he said this, Su Tao instinctively covered Chi Xiaocheng. [[17831 旁白 neutral]]
She shook her head without hesitation, "I'm sorry, this is an important gift from my friend. I can't give it to you." [[17832 苏桃 neutral]]
Unintentional words are the most hurtful. [[17833 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, who was already in a bad mood. [[17834 旁白 neutral]]
Once again truly heard the word "friend." [[17835 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's explanation at this moment might not have noticed such a detail, but for Chi Xiaocheng, it formed a question. [[17836 旁白 neutral]]
—Am I not the person you like? Why have I become a friend again? [[17837 池小橙 sad]]
A small mistake can be infinitely magnified by bias. [[17838 旁白 neutral]]
Tao Tao wasn't behaving anymore. [[17839 旁白 angry]]
And this Chu Lingfeng didn't want to let her go either! [[17840 旁白 angry]]
And after this, he might find reasons to approach Tao Tao, using her as the doll as an excuse! [[17841 旁白 angry]]
The release of emotions needs an outlet and a target. [[17842 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wouldn't pressure Tao Tao like before, and the target for this release... [[17843 旁白 neutral]]
She, who had been wondering how to get through the next ten-plus days, suddenly had a goal. [[17844 旁白 neutral]]
Save up 3000 Emotion Points, then buy a poison apple, and find a chance to get rid of Chu Lingfeng! [[17845 池小橙 angry]]
No one can take my Tao Tao away from me! [[17846 池小橙 angry]]
Even thinking about it is not allowed! [[17847 池小橙 angry]]
As her mind was racing, Chu Lingfeng pressed further. [[17848 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Su Tao, I just want to know the creator of this doll, or the manufacturer. I really like this doll and want to get one too. You were asking me for a favor before, right? Can't you even do me this small favor?" [[17849 楚凌风 angry]]
He was fixated on the doll that had almost gotten him killed. [[17850 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, just looking at it made his heart pound. [[17851 旁白 neutral]]
He was determined to win over Su Tao, but the master behind this doll had to be eliminated! [[17852 旁白 angry]]
