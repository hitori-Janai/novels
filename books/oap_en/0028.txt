Chapter 28: Lies [[2400 旁白 neutral]]
People are such strange creatures. [[2401 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang had felt a bit wronged when Su Tao ignored him. [[2402 旁白 neutral]]
But when Chi Xiaocheng filled his emotional needs, he felt it didn't matter anymore. [[2403 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't help but wonder if this version of Chi Xiaocheng was her true nature, and if her makeup attempts, multiple confessions to him, and targeting Su Tao were all because she was forced by the people who bullied her. [[2404 旁白 neutral]]
He had been secretly investigating Chi Xiaocheng. [[2405 旁白 neutral]]
However, he didn't know that after Chi Xiaocheng gained her hacking skills, she had simply gone through her own information and created some false impressions online. [[2406 旁白 neutral]]
Unless someone investigated on the ground, her story of being bullied and threatened could perfectly cover up the lies she had told during this time. [[2407 旁白 neutral]]
Plus, with Su Tao backing her up, [[2408 旁白 neutral]]
his investigation was exactly what Chi Xiaocheng had predicted. [[2409 旁白 neutral]]
It would naturally make people think [[2410 旁白 neutral]]
that what she did was actually because she was forced to! [[2411 旁白 neutral]]
However, Dongfang Yang wouldn't be like Su Tao, who would take care of her emotions and not ask questions. As soon as he sat down, he looked at Chi Xiaocheng's arms. "Now that things have calmed down, don't you plan to tell us about your situation? Last night's situation was very serious." [[2412 东方阳 neutral]]
Although he didn't mention the suicide attempt, [[2413 旁白 neutral]]
his slightly raised eyebrows made Chi Xiaocheng understand that she wouldn't get past this without a clear explanation. [[2414 旁白 neutral]]
One question was directed at two people. [[2415 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng hung her head so her expression couldn't be seen, while Su Tao was panicking inside. [[2416 旁白 neutral]]
Things like being yandere, self-harm, and liking herself - if these were talked about openly, people might not even believe it, but Xiaocheng was still a dangerous person. [[2417 旁白 neutral]]
She knew that Dongfang Yang had some feelings for her. If he found out, or if word got to Ye Liang and the others, and things got out of hand, they might be fine. [[2418 旁白 neutral]]
But what about Xiaocheng? [[2419 旁白 neutral]]
Even if they didn't hurt Xiaocheng, wouldn't Xiaocheng hurt herself? [[2420 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt anxious, but her mind quickly searched for a solution. [[2421 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, what Dongfang Yang had talked about last night came to mind. [[2422 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng was forced into this. She was bullied and threatened, so she acted this way. [[2423 旁白 neutral]]
That's right, as long as Xiaocheng cooperated and nodded along with what she said, they could temporarily hide it from Dongfang Yang! [[2424 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's spirits lifted. Having thought of a solution, she was about to speak when she saw Chi Xiaocheng speak first. "The wounds on my arms - I made them myself." [[2425 池小橙 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng?" Su Tao stared at Chi Xiaocheng, not knowing what to do. [[2426 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang frowned and looked at her without saying anything. [[2427 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a deep breath and said, "I don't want Taotao and Ye Liang to be together!" [[2428 池小橙 neutral]]
She raised her head, her red eyes filled with determination. [[2429 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang paused and asked curiously, "Why? Don't you like Ye Liang?" [[2430 东方阳 neutral]]
"I don't like him at all." Chi Xiaocheng pouted. "He's so mean and always has a stern face. In the past, I used to see him yelling at people who helped him with things." [[2431 池小橙 neutral]]
"If you don't do well, you get scolded. I don't want Taotao to be with him." She lowered her head again. "Last night's party was important, right? He wanted to take Taotao to a party before to satisfy his pride." [[2432 池小橙 neutral]]
"I knew without thinking that he would say something like 'Taotao is my girlfriend.' With so many rich people there, once he said it, everyone would know, right?" [[2433 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao with incredibly gentle eyes. "Taotao is just an ordinary person. If so many people talked about her, could she fight back? If that Ye Liang got unhappy, who knows what he might do? If she really became his girlfriend, she'd definitely be bullied every day." [[2434 池小橙 neutral]]
Of course, the original Su Tao in the story was so soft. No matter what these male leads did, she basically never argued back. She just accepted everything and being bullied was normal for her. [[2435 旁白 neutral]]
The betrayal by all the male leads in the later part of the story, forcing Su Tao to commit suicide, was even worse. [[2436 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's words caused huge waves in both Dongfang Yang and Su Tao's hearts. [[2437 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was thinking that the main reason Xiaocheng had her breakdown in the basement last time was because Ye Liang had already wanted to publicly announce that she was his girlfriend. [[2438 旁白 neutral]]
But actually, that was just pretend, just to help him save face. [[2439 旁白 neutral]]
But Xiaocheng didn't know it was pretend! [[2440 旁白 neutral]]
She had always been well-behaved and gentle because things had never crossed her bottom line? [[2441 旁白 neutral]]
So Xiaocheng's previous targeting of Ye Liang, even confessing to Ye Liang, was all for me. [[2442 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at it from Chi Xiaocheng's perspective, Su Tao couldn't help but feel moved. [[2443 旁白 neutral]]
But Dongfang Yang didn't think so. He was thinking that Chi Xiaocheng had confessed to Ye Liang so many times, and it was actually for Su Tao? [[2444 旁白 neutral]]
He had really thought that Chi Xiaocheng liked Ye Liang, and because she clashed with Su Tao and thought Su Tao had stolen her man, she targeted Su Tao. [[2445 旁白 neutral]]
For a friend, she was willing to sacrifice herself. Did such friendship really exist? [[2446 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Chi Xiaocheng looked at him again and said slowly, "Actually, I think you're much better than Ye Liang, Young Master Dongfang." [[2447 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang: "!" [[2448 东方阳 neutral]]
Could it be [[2449 旁白 neutral]]
that Chi Xiaocheng thinks I'm more suitable for Su Tao than Ye Liang? [[2450 旁白 neutral]]
She confessed to Ye Liang because she disliked him and didn't want Su Tao to fall into his hands. [[2451 旁白 neutral]]
But she also confessed to me, the difference being that she confessed fewer times and hardly ever targeted me. Doesn't this prove that she actually likes me a little? [[2452 旁白 neutral]]
She's even willing to ruin the relationship between Ye Liang and Su Tao for me! [[2453 旁白 neutral]]
Well, Dongfang Yang also felt he was overthinking things. At first glance, what Chi Xiaocheng said seemed fine, but you could still see the contradictions in the logic. [[2454 旁白 neutral]]
It was just that he had been led astray, so Dongfang Yang didn't think in that direction. [[2455 旁白 neutral]]
Calming himself down, Dongfang Yang decided not to think wildly anymore. "What about the wounds on your arms? Just calling Su Tao back from the party and making up a lie would have been enough, right? Why did you have to go to such extremes?" [[2456 东方阳 neutral]]
Hearing this question, Su Tao's heart also tightened. [[2457 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked away from Dongfang Yang's gaze. "Anyway, nobody wants me. If Taotao gets together with Ye Liang, she definitely won't want me anymore, so I might as well..." [[2458 池小橙 sad]]
Might as well die. [[2459 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't finish, but both of them understood what she meant. [[2460 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was about to continue when Su Tao grabbed his sleeve, shook her head, and pulled him out of the room. [[2461 旁白 neutral]]
"What's wrong?" Dongfang Yang looked at Su Tao with confusion. [[2462 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao twisted a strand of hair around her finger, looking a bit agitated. "Dongfang Yang, stop asking so many questions. Can't you see that Xiaocheng clearly has some psychological problems?" [[2463 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang paused. "I think she seems pretty normal, and about the wounds on her arms and the suicide attempt, there has to be some conclusion, right? Aren't you afraid this kind of thing will happen again?" [[2464 东方阳 neutral]]
"I... I'll watch over her." Su Tao bit her lip. "That was done because some people bullied her and forced her to do it. When I went back to the dorm yesterday afternoon, I saw Xiaocheng being beaten up by someone. You should know that some people just enjoy tormenting others for fun." [[2465 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang frowned and sighed. "Alright, I'll listen to you and stop asking." [[2466 东方阳 neutral]]
He could tell at a glance that Su Tao was hiding something from him. [[2467 旁白 neutral]]
And it definitely had to do with Chi Xiaocheng. [[2468 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe the truth wasn't that simple. [[2469 旁白 neutral]]
But... forget it. Su Tao must have her reasons. He wouldn't dig deeper into this matter. [[2470 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked sideways through the door crack at the dazed Chi Xiaocheng. "But the matter with those delinquent girls will have to wait. Su Tao, you should think about how to explain things to Ye Liang after you're discharged." [[2471 东方阳 neutral]]
"That guy - I don't think he'll let Chi Xiaocheng off easily." [[2472 东方阳 neutral]]
