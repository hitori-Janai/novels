Chapter 159: The Beginning of Revenge [[13957 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how she called out or cried, the person sleeping quietly in the hospital bed did not wake up. [[13958 旁白 sad]]
She gently pulled up the blanket, but the medical instruments on the body seemed to mock her helplessness. [[13959 旁白 sad]]
The person was already dead, but they kept trying to preserve a life that was no longer there. [[13960 旁白 sad]]
It was absurd. [[13961 旁白 sad]]
So absurd that Su Tao couldn't help but hope that these cold instruments could bring her back to life. [[13962 旁白 sad]]
Tears were useless, and pleading was pointless. [[13963 旁白 sad]]
Regret had already filled her heart. [[13964 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao sat silently by Chi Xiaocheng's bed for half the day. [[13965 旁白 sad]]
She was motionless, like a lifeless doll. [[13966 旁白 sad]]
It wasn't until after 12 PM that Su Tao slowly stood up and gently tucked Chi Xiaocheng's small hand back under the covers. [[13967 旁白 sad]]
Her desperate eyes revealed her confusion. [[13968 旁白 sad]]
She had to accept reality. [[13969 旁白 sad]]
To accept the reality that Xiaocheng had died for her. [[13970 旁白 sad]]
But if she left the hospital now, wouldn't she be leaving Xiaocheng all alone again? [[13971 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao walked out of the hospital room and saw Dongfang Yang sitting on a bench outside with his legs crossed, resting with his eyes closed. [[13972 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, he had been waiting here for a long time. [[13973 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Su Tao's footsteps, Dongfang Yang opened his eyes and looked her up and down. "Have you recovered your ability to think?" [[13974 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and nodded slightly. "I'm sorry." [[13975 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang stood up with a sigh. "You don't need to apologize. You and Chi Xiaocheng are both my friends. You only show this fragile side in front of her. Your reaction now is exactly what Professor Su and I expected." [[13976 东方阳 neutral]]
"I just feel so terrible." [[13977 苏桃 sad]]
"Even if it hurts, you have to look forward. You should now live on with Chi Xiaocheng's will, not waste your life away." [[13978 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao tried to force a smile, but her lips trembled and she failed. Instead, she asked, "When will Xiaocheng be cremated?" [[13979 苏桃 sad]]
"?" [[13980 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang gave her a strange look. [[13981 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lip and said, "Even so, I... I don't want Xiaocheng to be alone. I want to, at least... at least keep her ashes with me, so she won't be so lonely." [[13982 苏桃 sad]]
And I won't be so lonely either. [[13983 旁白 sad]]
But to Su Tao's surprise, when she said this, Dongfang Yang's expression became even stranger. [[13984 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong?" [[13985 苏桃 neutral]]
"No, it's nothing." [[13986 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang thought for a moment but decided not to share Professor Su's theory. [[13987 旁白 neutral]]
Two days had passed since Chi Xiaocheng's death. [[13988 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, after a person dies, their body temperature drops, their skin turns pale or bluish-purple, and dark spots appear on the lower parts of the body as blood settles. [[13989 旁白 neutral]]
Without any preservation, the body would also begin to stiffen, and bacteria and enzymes in the body would start to break down tissues, causing a noticeable odor. [[13990 旁白 neutral]]
These were just a few of the changes visible on the outside, not to mention what was happening inside. [[13991 旁白 neutral]]
But miraculously, Chi Xiaocheng had been dead for two days. [[13992 旁白 neutral]]
Except for a slight drop in body temperature, there were no other signs of "post-mortem changes." Although her heart had stopped and the ECG was a flat line, the cells in her body were still active. [[13993 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if some mysterious force was repairing this broken body. [[13994 旁白 neutral]]
If she were cremated immediately, there would be no chance for a miracle to happen. [[13995 旁白 neutral]]
But this was something only he and Professor Su should know. It was better not to give Su Tao false hope until they were sure. [[13996 旁白 neutral]]
If her hopes were raised too high only to be met with despair again, she might break down even more completely. [[13997 旁白 neutral]]
It was better to let her gradually adapt to the reality of the situation, just as she was doing now. [[13998 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang coughed lightly and explained, "I understand how you feel, but there's no need to cremate her so quickly. Chi Xiaocheng's parents are old and in poor health. They couldn't handle such an emotional shock." [[13999 东方阳 neutral]]
"For now, we can tell them that Chi Xiaocheng is just sick." [[14000 东方阳 neutral]]
"We'll keep the body here for now and preserve it perfectly with the best technology. Don't worry." [[14001 东方阳 neutral]]
After speaking, Dongfang Yang turned to look at Su Tao and saw that she had started crying again. [[14002 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao clenched her fist and punched her own left shoulder. "I... I've failed her parents... Sob..." [[14003 苏桃 sad]]
Her memory flashed back to a certain night. [[14004 旁白 sad]]
Faced with a yandere Chi Xiaocheng, she had wanted to escape her possessiveness, to abandon her. [[14005 旁白 sad]]
That same night, Chi's mother had called. After asking about Chi Xiaocheng's situation, she had trustingly left Xiaocheng in her care. [[14006 旁白 sad]]
She even hinted that she would have no objection if the two of them were in a romantic relationship. [[14007 旁白 sad]]
Chi's mother wasn't just asking her to look after Xiaocheng while she studied in Jiuzhou City, but possibly for the rest of her life! [[14008 旁白 sad]]
All sorts of emotions welled up in her heart again. This time, there were more people she had let down. [[14009 旁白 sad]]
Chi's father and mother, who had watched her grow up, and Brother Chi Song. [[14010 旁白 sad]]
They were all like her own family! [[14011 旁白 sad]]
Realizing he had unintentionally made things worse, Dongfang Yang felt a little guilty and wanted to comfort her but didn't know where to start. [[14012 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, he just led Su Tao to the hospital balcony. [[14013 旁白 neutral]]
They were on the fifth floor, and the balcony had a good view of a small park nearby. [[14014 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang said, "Don't overthink it. For now, focus on calming down and taking care of yourself. Leave the rest to me." [[14015 东方阳 neutral]]
"No!" [[14016 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao stared blankly at the snowy scene, her expression suddenly becoming firm. "I still have things I need to do!" [[14017 苏桃 angry]]
"You said the person who hurt Xiaocheng is still free. Who did it?!" [[14018 苏桃 angry]]
As her reason returned, Su Tao already had an answer in her heart. [[14019 旁白 neutral]]
It was either Ye Liang or Lin Fangya! [[14020 旁白 angry]]
Xiao Ming was also a possibility. [[14021 旁白 neutral]]
Besides those three, there was no one else who would target her and could hire a sniper for an assassination. [[14022 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, her hatred for the killer overshadowed the guilt and regret in her heart. [[14023 旁白 angry]]
The first step to living on for Xiaocheng was to eliminate the killer! [[14024 旁白 angry]]
To get revenge for Xiaocheng! [[14025 旁白 angry]]
Dongfang Yang sighed helplessly. "In your current state, won't you just be an easy target if you go after the killer?" [[14026 东方阳 neutral]]
"Then you have to at least tell me the killer's name! Was it Ye Liang?!" [[14027 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao's eyes grew frantic. [[14028 旁白 angry]]
In her anger, she clearly couldn't think as rationally as usual. [[14029 旁白 angry]]
"It was Ye Liang. So how do you plan to get revenge?" Dongfang Yang rolled his eyes at Su Tao. "Are you going to burst into the hospital where he is, or wait for him at his company? He's the proper young master of the Ye family." [[14030 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang continued, "My family has gotten involved and told me not to interfere with Ye Liang's affairs. They even wanted me to go back to the capital. If I hadn't argued, I probably wouldn't have had the chance to stay here with you." [[14031 东方阳 neutral]]
"At most, I can send a team of bodyguards who are retired from the battlefield to protect you. As for how to deal with Ye Liang, you should go discuss it with Si Chen." [[14032 东方阳 neutral]]
"But the condition is," Dongfang Yang's voice suddenly rose, "that you go home and take care of your health, so you don't become a weakness for Ye Liang to exploit!" [[14033 东方阳 angry]]
"I understand." [[14034 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao closed her eyes and took a long, deep breath. [[14035 旁白 neutral]]
As she forced herself to calm down, the fire of revenge in her heart was burning fiercely! [[14036 旁白 angry]]
