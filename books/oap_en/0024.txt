Chapter 24: Do You Know About Yandere? [[2085 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng had thought about this long before winning over Chen Qian. [[2086 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao must be completely confused when facing her right now, and because of her special situation, she wouldn't talk to Ye Liang, Dongfang Yang, or others about it. This meant she would definitely look for other people to ask about her condition. [[2087 旁白 neutral]]
    Now that they had just entered university two months ago, among the supporting characters who had good relationships with Su Tao, Chen Qian, who was still undercover, was one of them. [[2088 旁白 neutral]]
    As long as Su Tao asked Chen Qian about her, she would have a lot of room to operate. [[2089 旁白 neutral]]
    Thinking of this, Chi Xiaocheng sent a message to Chen Qian, "What did she tell you?" [[2090 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chen Qian replied, "She said some strange things, like if someone who was normally fine suddenly became weird, having episodes and asking what oranges taste like and stuff." [[2091 陈倩 neutral]]
    Chen Qian: "You're playing such a big game, and what does she mean by what she said?" [[2092 陈倩 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng: "Why do you think it's me?" [[2093 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chen Qian: "You told me to stay hidden around her just to deceive her, right? Just tell me directly how you want me to respond to her." [[2094 陈倩 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng felt a bit embarrassed. [[2095 旁白 neutral]]
    Was it that obvious? [[2096 池小橙 neutral]]
    She sent over a WeChat ID, "Tell Su Tao to add this account. This is a professional psychologist." [[2097 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chen Qian: "A psychologist?" [[2098 陈倩 neutral]]
    "Just say it's someone you know, someone reliable." [[2099 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng quickly switched to a different WeChat account and logged into another one of her alternate accounts. [[2100 旁白 neutral]]
    This psychologist was exactly the account she had created. Whether it was the content in the friend circle or the contacts, she had disguised everything very well. [[2101 旁白 neutral]]
    As for where she got these skills, she had to thank the system's single draw last time - Hacker (Intermediate). [[2102 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng originally didn't think this skill would be very useful. The original owner was just an ordinary student, and she was already grateful she didn't start with debt. She didn't have money to buy a series of hacking tools. [[2103 旁白 neutral]]
    Without even a botnet, what kind of hacker could she be? [[2104 池小橙 neutral]]
    But thinking about it again, even without tools, she had already gained the corresponding knowledge. She could still do some basic disguising of her information without any problems. [[2105 旁白 neutral]]
    Like creating this fairly perfect psychologist alternate account. [[2106 旁白 neutral]]
    And like how she knew her changes would be investigated by Dongfang Yang, Ye Liang, and others, so she spread a lot of information that could cover up her strange behavior. [[2107 旁白 neutral]]
    For example, bullying! [[2108 池小橙 neutral]]
    The original owner had always been bullied, and Chi Xiaocheng could completely use being bullied to explain her psychological changes. [[2109 旁白 neutral]]
    With Su Tao's character, if she was being bullied, she would definitely blame herself for not protecting her well, right? [[2110 池小橙 neutral]]
    Although Chen Qian didn't know why Chi Xiaocheng wanted to do this, she still followed her instructions and recommended this psychologist's WeChat to Su Tao. [[2111 旁白 neutral]]
    Then she found several more reasons. [[2112 旁白 neutral]]
    Before long, Su Tao added Chi Xiaocheng's alternate account. [[2113 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng looked sideways at the wall on the right, as if she could see Su Tao sitting on the hospital bed holding her phone, with a cute expression and slightly furrowed eyebrows. [[2114 旁白 neutral]]
    A shallow smile curved at the corners of her lips as she sent the first message. [[2115 旁白 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "Hello (handshake)." [[2116 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "Hello, Doctor. I'm very sorry to bother you." [[2117 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "It's fine. As a doctor, it's normal to help patients solve their problems, especially since you were recommended by my distant niece. Just tell me what the problem is." [[2118 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "It's like this - I have a friend who has someone around her who has become very strange because of certain things. Let me organize my words and try to explain it to you as briefly as possible." [[2119 苏桃 neutral]]
    Seeing this message, Chi Xiaocheng burst out laughing. [[2120 旁白 neutral]]
    The classic "I have a friend." [[2121 池小橙 happy]]
    "Peach, being this innocent makes you very easy to deceive." [[2122 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng decisively exposed Su Tao's disguise, "Miss Peach, I'm a doctor, and we're two strangers. Maybe you think I'm not skilled enough and we should just delete each other. There's no need to be secretive. If you don't tell me honestly, how can I analyze it specifically?" [[2123 池小橙 neutral]]
    This long sentence made Su Tao in the next room blush. [[2124 旁白 neutral]]
    She instinctively didn't want to face Chi Xiaocheng's strange condition. [[2125 旁白 neutral]]
    This kind of thing was hard to talk about. [[2126 旁白 neutral]]
    "Sigh, she even recommended her distant uncle to help me. I can't let down her good intentions!" [[2127 苏桃 neutral]]
    So Su Tao calmed down. [[2128 旁白 neutral]]
    And started chatting with Chi Xiaocheng, this "Dr. Cheng," about what had happened recently. [[2129 旁白 neutral]]
    First the basement, then the rooftop. [[2130 旁白 neutral]]
    And she emphasized that Chi Xiaocheng had quite serious self-harm tendencies. [[2131 旁白 neutral]]
    Finally, she asked, "Doctor, why do you think she became like this?" [[2132 苏桃 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng pretended to think for a while, then typed, "A person's huge personality change must happen after experiencing something unacceptable, and then gradually changes occur." [[2133 池小橙 neutral]]
    "Has your friend experienced any disappointment because of something you did?" [[2134 池小橙 neutral]]
    Su Tao immediately thought of Chi Xiaocheng saying she liked her when she saw this message. [[2135 旁白 neutral]]
    So she replied, "Yes, we grew up together since childhood. Back then she was bullied, and I helped her. She had some psychological problems at that time and felt very insecure." [[2136 苏桃 neutral]]
    "So I often told her things like 'you're the most important person to me' and 'I will never leave you' to comfort her, though I actually meant it." [[2137 苏桃 neutral]]
    "There were no problems for many years, but now in university, quite a few boys are pursuing me. She misunderstood because of this and started self-harming, saying things like she likes me and telling me not to look for others." [[2138 苏桃 neutral]]
    "Doctor, is it possible that Xiaocheng developed wrong feelings for me?" [[2139 苏桃 neutral]]
    Wrong feelings? [[2140 池小橙 neutral]]
    Of course not. [[2141 池小橙 neutral]]
    I really like you, Peach! [[2142 池小橙 happy]]
    Sighing in her heart, Chi Xiaocheng typed back seriously, "That's also possible. Long-term lack of love and insecurity can make someone mistake dependence for liking." [[2143 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "I thought so too. After all, we're both girls, and her saying she likes me really gives me a headache." [[2144 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "But that possibility is very small. Based on what you said about her forcing you to say you like her and wanting to jump off a building, I think she might really like you." [[2145 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "Huh?" [[2146 苏桃 neutral]]
    Peach: "But... but we're both girls." [[2147 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "That's not the point." [[2148 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "This... this isn't the point?" [[2149 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "I've treated countless patients, and there are many who have problems with same-sex feelings. In my opinion, it's very normal. As long as there's love, gender can also be crossed." [[2150 池小橙 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "That's getting off topic. The point is your Xiaocheng's condition." [[2151 池小橙 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "Based on my years of experience, she most likely can't live without you. This is an unhealthy psychological disorder, as serious as common depression." [[2152 池小橙 neutral]]
    In the next room, Su Tao was stunned. Because she was completely led by Chi Xiaocheng's topic, she didn't even notice some flaws in the chat messages. [[2153 旁白 neutral]]
    She just anxiously asked, "Doctor, please don't keep me in suspense." [[2154 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "Miss Peach, don't be anxious. I don't know if you've heard of people called 'yandere'?" [[2155 池小橙 neutral]]
    "Yandere?" [[2156 苏桃 neutral]]
