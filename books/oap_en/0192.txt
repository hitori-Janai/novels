Chapter 192: A Correction in the World's Storyline? (Bonus chapter for Yakumo Azusa) [[16748 旁白 neutral]]
"It's a miracle..." [[16749 苏教授 neutral]]
As a medical professor, Professor Su didn't really believe in such things; she only trusted the cold, hard data from the instruments. [[16750 旁白 neutral]]
But she had to admit that in her career, she had seen many people who survived because of their willpower. [[16751 旁白 neutral]]
They didn't want to leave this world, didn't want to lose the people they loved, and certainly didn't want to abandon their families, leaving their daughters without support. [[16752 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how painful, tiring, or difficult it was, even when hope was almost zero, miracles like that could still happen. [[16753 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang asked, "I feel like our equipment isn't really helping. Professor, do you have any other way to help Chi Xiaocheng?" [[16754 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su shrugged. "I don't, but... I have heard of someone who might have a way." [[16755 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow. "Is it an outsider?" [[16756 东方阳 neutral]]
"Yes." Professor Su nodded. "It happened in the last two months. Young Dongfang, you should have heard of him too—the young miracle doctor who has recently become famous." [[16757 苏教授 neutral]]
"The one who cured the Si family elder?" Dongfang Yang looked surprised. "Wasn't that just a rumor?" [[16758 东方阳 neutral]]
Jiuzhou City wasn't that big. Since Ye Liang's death, only two of the three major families truly controlled the city. [[16759 旁白 neutral]]
One was his Dongfang family. [[16760 旁白 neutral]]
The Dongfang family in the capital didn't want to get involved in this mess and wanted him to return, but he insisted on staying. So, the family sent someone to Jiuzhou City to maintain their influence. [[16761 旁白 neutral]]
The second was Si Chen's Si family. [[16762 旁白 neutral]]
However, the Si family in Jiuzhou City was not close to Si Chen. He was an outcast from the capital's Si family, driven out by his older brother, and had no choice but to come here. [[16763 旁白 neutral]]
The Si family in Jiuzhou City was still technically under his brother's control. In the original story, before he got help from Su Tao's god-of-war father, he was a nobody in this city. [[16764 旁白 neutral]]
He had some influence but was severely restricted. [[16765 旁白 neutral]]
Now that he had absorbed some of Ye Liang's forces, he could finally make his presence known. [[16766 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, if the Si family elder in Jiuzhou City had died, Si Chen could have taken over his older brother's influence and strengthened his own position. [[16767 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone thought that once the elder died, Si Chen, the outcast, would finally take center stage. [[16768 旁白 neutral]]
However, two months ago, a miracle doctor who looked no older than 25 appeared out of nowhere and saved the dying elder with his "miraculous needles"! [[16769 旁白 neutral]]
Countless influential families sought him out, offering huge sums of money for his life-saving skills. [[16770 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang had also wanted to see him, as his own grandfather was in poor health and staying in a hospital in the capital. [[16771 旁白 neutral]]
But then rumors spread that it was all fake, and with Chi Xiaocheng's death, he had put the matter aside. [[16772 旁白 neutral]]
And now, they were saying it was true? [[16773 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su said seriously, "The rumors were spread because the Si family wanted to keep the miracle doctor for themselves. I've already visited the elder. His name is Si Zhenliu." [[16774 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang: "How is he?" [[16775 东方阳 neutral]]
"He's doing great!" Professor Su's voice was filled with shock. "Six months ago, I was invited to diagnose Si Zhenliu. At 72, he had at most a year left to live and was kept alive by expensive nutrient solutions." [[16776 苏教授 happy]]
"But when I saw him last time, he could get out of bed and eat normally. He could even do simple exercises, and his complexion was surprisingly good!" [[16777 苏教授 happy]]
"Some people even say that he calls young women in their 20s to his room at night. You have to remember, the old man is 72!" [[16778 苏教授 happy]]
Professor Su's expression turned serious. "I suspect this miracle doctor is from your world. It's simply unheard of!" [[16779 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang thought for a moment. "Even if he is from that world, he couldn't possibly do this." [[16780 东方阳 neutral]]
He had grown up in the family and was the sole designated heir of the Dongfang family. [[16781 旁白 neutral]]
He had more than one or two ancient martial arts bodyguards protecting him in secret. [[16782 旁白 neutral]]
He was very familiar with these martial artists. [[16783 旁白 neutral]]
At best, they could enhance their physical abilities. Light-footwork was already considered an exaggeration, and dodging bullets was the absolute limit. You might not find one person in a thousand who could easily dodge bullets. [[16784 旁白 neutral]]
Those who could reach that level were all old. [[16785 旁白 neutral]]
They could barely walk, let alone dodge bullets. [[16786 旁白 neutral]]
Controlling scissors with qi, cutting water with a slash... isn't that something out of a novel? [[16787 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't believe in this miracle doctor, but... the change in the elder was undeniable. [[16788 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way." Dongfang Yang suddenly remembered something and took out his phone. "I remember the Si family sent me an invitation. I think it's for Si Zhenliu's 73rd birthday." [[16789 东方阳 neutral]]
"Let me see, the time..." Dongfang Yang was amazed. "It's exactly next Saturday. There are five days left." [[16790 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su asked, "Are you going to check it out?" [[16791 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang thought for a while, the image of Chi Xiaocheng's innocent yet timid smile flashing in his mind. He sighed, "Let's go." [[16792 东方阳 sad]]
He originally didn't want to go. [[16793 旁白 neutral]]
From a strategic point of view, he represented the Dongfang family. Going there would imply taking a side and forming an alliance. [[16794 旁白 neutral]]
After all, Si Chen was his friend, not Si Chen's older brother. [[16795 旁白 neutral]]
However, he had to grasp at that glimmer of hope. What if that miracle doctor really had something? [[16796 旁白 neutral]]
Wouldn't there be a real chance to save Chi Xiaocheng? [[16797 旁白 happy]]
Just then, a small voice came from behind them. "Can you take me with you to the birthday banquet?" [[16798 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang and Professor Su turned around abruptly and noticed Su Tao standing behind the half-open door. [[16799 旁白 neutral]]
His mouth twitched. "Su Tao, when did you start listening?" [[16800 东方阳 neutral]]
"When you started talking about the miracle doctor." [[16801 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao walked out, looking a little embarrassed, but her eyes were extremely determined. "If there's really a chance to save Xiaocheng, I'm willing to do anything!" [[16802 苏桃 happy]]
Professor Su shrugged. "That could work. Miss Su can go as your date. In terms of looks and presence, no one would think you're just an ordinary person." [[16803 苏教授 neutral]]
But as soon as she said that, Su Tao became conflicted. [[16804 旁白 neutral]]
She looked like she wanted to say something but couldn't. [[16805 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what, she had started to develop feelings for Chi Xiaocheng. [[16806 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't have minded before she felt this way. [[16807 旁白 neutral]]
But now, being Dongfang Yang's date, even if it was just pretend, made her feel like she was betraying Xiaocheng. [[16808 旁白 sad]]
Even though Dongfang Yang was a good person. [[16809 旁白 neutral]]
Before she could speak, Dongfang Yang noticed her hesitation and smiled gently. "There's no need to force it. My family has already arranged a date for me. Su Tao, you can just come as my sister." [[16810 东方阳 happy]]
"Okay!" [[16811 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao breathed a sigh of relief, but she also felt more embarrassed. [[16812 旁白 neutral]]
After saying she was going to "check on" Xiaocheng again, she returned to the hospital room, closing the door behind her. [[16813 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su asked, confused, "When did you arrange for a date?" [[16814 苏教授 neutral]]
"Just now." Dongfang Yang took out his phone, walked to the balcony, and called an old acquaintance. "Hello, Qian Qing?" [[16815 东方阳 neutral]]
A pleasant, mature female voice answered, "Spit it out." [[16816 钱清 neutral]]
"The Si family elder's 73rd birthday is on Saturday. Your Qian family must have been invited too. I know you're missing a male companion, how about I lend myself to you for a night?" [[16817 东方阳 neutral]]
"Aren't you good friends with Si Chen? Si Zhenliu is on his brother's side, right? Is the Dongfang family going to side with his brother?" [[16818 钱清 neutral]]
"I was thinking of you. We're friends, so I'm repaying the favor for you taking care of Su Tao for me last time." [[16819 东方阳 happy]]
Qian Qing was silent for a moment. "If you keep being so coy, I'm hanging up." [[16820 钱清 angry]]
"No, no, don't!" Dongfang Yang said anxiously. "Alright, alright, I don't have a date. You know I'm not interested in those other women. Since you don't have anyone either, let's team up. That way, neither of us will be embarrassed at the banquet." [[16821 东方阳 sad]]
Hearing this, Qian Qing sighed. "I don't know what to do with you. You owe me at least two meals for this, you know?" [[16822 钱清 neutral]]
"OKK!" [[16823 东方阳 happy]]
After hanging up, Dongfang Yang sighed helplessly. "Two meals, what a loss!" [[16824 东方阳 sad]]
Professor Su walked over to him. "Why not let Miss Su be your date? With her personality, she wouldn't have refused if you were more assertive. If you like her, this would have been a good opportunity." [[16825 苏教授 neutral]]
"Although what Ye Liang did was despicable, if Miss Chi hadn't interfered last time, she would have attended that party and been recognized as Ye Liang's girlfriend." [[16826 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang frowned. "He's already dead, let's not talk about him. It's bad luck." [[16827 东方阳 angry]]
"Besides, you saw it too, didn't you, Professor? Su Tao was in a difficult position." [[16828 东方阳 neutral]]
"True." Professor Su recalled Su Tao's conflicted expression and thought about her and Chi Xiaocheng's mutual care, sighing helplessly. [[16829 苏教授 sad]]
She knew that Chi Xiaocheng liked Su Tao, and that Su Tao cared a lot about Chi Xiaocheng. [[16830 旁白 neutral]]
Being Dongfang Yang's date at this time was indeed inappropriate. [[16831 旁白 neutral]]
It was her mistake just now. [[16832 旁白 sad]]
I should apologize to Miss Su later. [[16833 旁白 neutral]]
As she was thinking this, she saw Dongfang Yang looking at the sun outside. "Actually, I know why Su Tao was so hesitant." [[16834 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su raised an eyebrow. "You already know?" [[16835 苏教授 neutral]]
"Yeah!" Dongfang Yang sighed deeply. "Su Tao knows that Chi Xiaocheng likes me. Now that there's a chance for Chi Xiaocheng to be revived... no, not revived, a chance to wake up." [[16836 东方阳 sad]]
Professor Su: "So?" [[16837 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Professor Su in disbelief. "Professor, you still don't get it?" [[16838 东方阳 neutral]]
"Su Tao likes me, and she knows Chi Xiaocheng also likes me. She feels it's unfair to her sister to snatch me away like this!" [[16839 东方阳 sad]]
"She's probably thinking of waiting for Chi Xiaocheng to wake up and then having a fair competition!" [[16840 东方阳 sad]]
As he spoke, Dongfang Yang clutched his head in pain again. "Su Tao is undoubtedly outstanding, like a white moonlight. But that simple little fool Chi Xiaocheng is also quite cute." [[16841 东方阳 sad]]
"Sigh, who should I choose?" [[16842 东方阳 sad]]
Professor Su was speechless. She hesitated for a long time, not knowing how to explain it to Dongfang Yang. [[16843 旁白 neutral]]
But on second thought, the current situation was pretty good. [[16844 旁白 neutral]]
So she reached out and patted Dongfang Yang's shoulder comfortingly. "My boy, you are invincible." [[16845 苏教授 happy]]
Dongfang Yang: "???" [[16846 东方阳 neutral]]
What does that mean? Is she praising me for being too outstanding? [[16847 旁白 neutral]]
After deciding to attend the birthday banquet that weekend, Su Tao went home early. [[16848 旁白 neutral]]
Knowing that Chi Xiaocheng was slowly recovering and might wake up, her once gloomy heart was rekindled with passion. [[16849 旁白 happy]]
A desire for life was reborn. [[16850 旁白 happy]]
Her health was poor, and she didn't look well. [[16851 旁白 sad]]
Although she had a sweet dream last night, her emotions had been very volatile in her sleep. She had recovered a little, but not much. [[16852 旁白 sad]]
She didn't want Chi Xiaocheng to see her looking worn out when she woke up. [[16853 旁白 sad]]
Just as she had said in her dream. [[16854 旁白 neutral]]
--I hope Taotao can live happily in the future. [[16855 池小橙 happy]]
For this reason, she even asked Dongfang Yang to find her a health management nutritionist. [[16856 旁白 neutral]]
Although she owed him more and more. [[16857 旁白 neutral]]
But... after Xiaocheng really wakes up, she would thank him together with Xiaocheng. [[16858 旁白 happy]]
Besides this, Su Tao had other things to do. [[16859 旁白 neutral]]
The next day, she specifically sought out Fang Ning and gave her a sincere apology. [[16860 旁白 neutral]]
But to her surprise, Fang Ning also knew that Chi Xiaocheng might wake up. [[16861 旁白 neutral]]
After asking, she found out that Dongfang Yang had told her. [[16862 旁白 neutral]]
According to the doctor taking care of her, she might have suicidal thoughts and needed an emotional pillar. [[16863 旁白 neutral]]
The small animals at the Yangyang Cat Cafe were clearly not enough. The person who tied the bell must be the one to untie it. [[16864 旁白 neutral]]
So he had to tell her the news to give her some hope. [[16865 旁白 neutral]]
However, after the apology, Su Tao and Fang Ning did not make peace. [[16866 旁白 neutral]]
The other just left a cold sentence, "Even if Sister Xiaocheng wakes up, I will not forgive you!" [[16867 方柠 angry]]
To be honest, this attitude actually made Su Tao feel much more relieved. [[16868 旁白 neutral]]
Gentleness is the most hurtful blade. [[16869 旁白 neutral]]
No matter the outcome, she would do everything she could for Xiaocheng! [[16870 旁白 happy]]
And this news, besides Fang Ning, Dongfang Yang also told Chi Song. [[16871 旁白 neutral]]
Although at the moment, Chi Xiaocheng's revival was a fantasy, this young man, who had already lost an arm, was on the verge of collapse. [[16872 旁白 sad]]
Brother Long was consolidating the underground forces of Jiuzhou City. [[16873 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song, on the other hand, was acting like a madman, searching for the accomplices Xiao Ming and Lin Fangya while also going after Ye Liang's remaining forces. [[16874 旁白 angry]]
He spent his days with cigarettes and alcohol. [[16875 旁白 sad]]
His hair was messy, his face covered in stubble, and his deep eyes were almost lifeless. [[16876 旁白 sad]]
If it weren't for Su Tao and his parents being his last remaining ties, Chi Song would have probably thrown his life away. [[16877 旁白 sad]]
Even so, when they finally found him, he was in a garbage can almost buried in snow. [[16878 旁白 sad]]
He had gotten drunk in some rundown old shops, had all his money and belongings stolen, and was then thrown out. [[16879 旁白 sad]]
And with this news, the young man went to the hospital to see Chi Xiaocheng and only then did he regain his spirit. [[16880 旁白 happy]]
It was now Wednesday, with two and a half days left before the birthday banquet. [[16881 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did Chi Xiaocheng find out that Su Tao was going to find that miracle doctor male lead! [[16882 旁白 neutral]]
She had 19 days left to live, and her body was getting better and better. It was understandable that Professor Su and the others guessed she had a chance of waking up. [[16883 旁白 neutral]]
It was also reasonable for Su Tao to know. [[16884 旁白 neutral]]
But she never expected that after deviating from the original plotline, the miracle doctor male lead, who hadn't appeared for two months, would be connected to Su Tao because of her! [[16885 旁白 neutral]]
The great hand of the Heavenly Dao's will? [[16886 旁白 neutral]]
Or a correction based on the original plot? [[16887 旁白 neutral]]
After all, it was all happening in the small place of Jiuzhou City. It wasn't strange for such an opportunity to arise, but that was the male lead! [[16888 旁白 neutral]]
This miracle doctor male lead wasn't foolish like Dongfang Yang; in the original story, he was not a kind person. [[16889 旁白 neutral]]
[But Host, in your current state, you can't influence the course of this plot at all. Even though the disguise skill has cooled down, you don't have a suitable identity to get in, do you?] [[16890 系统 neutral]]
Hearing the System's words, Chi Xiaocheng's eyes gradually hardened. "No, even as a scarecrow, I must accompany Taotao!" [[16891 池小橙 angry]]
What miracle doctor male lead, daring to steal my Taotao. [[16892 池小橙 angry]]
Ye Liang's fate will be yours! [[16893 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng hid among the dolls, constantly thinking about how to get Su Tao to bring her, this doll, along. [[16894 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey, I have an idea!" [[16895 池小橙 happy]]
