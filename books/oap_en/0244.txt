Chapter 244: Su Tao's "Rival" [[20864 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen didn't know the original story and could only analyze based on the current information, so he naturally thought Xiao Ming was a fake. [[20865 旁白 neutral]]
Last time, he was kicked by Dongfang Yang and didn't resist at all. When the marriage contract was torn up, he just made some empty threats and then scurried away. [[20866 旁白 neutral]]
From an outsider's perspective, how could the Dragon King be so weak? [[20867 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng knew the truth. [[20868 旁白 neutral]]
He was the real Dragon King. [[20869 旁白 neutral]]
In the original novel, when he was told to endure for three years, he really did it. [[20870 旁白 neutral]]
She just didn't expect that the opportunity to find Su Tao's father would still lead back to a male lead like him after all. [[20871 旁白 neutral]]
Although he disappeared later in the original novel and his presence was almost zero, he still had plot armor. [[20872 旁白 neutral]]
Without a "poison apple" to counteract his male lead plot armor, the world's will would still be on his side. [[20873 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng didn't say what she was thinking. Instead, she asked, "So, are you planning to investigate this Xiao Ming with all your effort?" [[20874 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yes!" [[20875 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen nodded firmly. "So I want to confirm the plan related to Su Tao with you again. If you don't need me for what's next, I plan to focus all my energy on tracking down Xiao Ming." [[20876 司辰 neutral]]
"He's on Ye Liang's side, and now that he's missing, I feel a little uneasy." [[20877 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could understand him. [[20878 旁白 neutral]]
He had to return to the Si family for the New Year. [[20879 旁白 neutral]]
He was bound to be humiliated this time. The sooner he found Su Tao's "God of War" father, the sooner he could turn his situation around. [[20880 旁白 neutral]]
Before, there wasn't much I needed you for. [[20881 旁白 neutral]]
But this time was different! [[20882 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Si Chen seriously. "Actually, there is one thing I'd like to ask you to do." [[20883 池小橙 neutral]]
Her recent idea was missing a pawn. [[20884 旁白 neutral]]
Ningning wouldn't work. [[20885 旁白 neutral]]
As for Dongfang Yang, Chi Xiaocheng wanted to laugh just thinking of his name, so he was even more out of the question. [[20886 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng staring at him without moving, Si Chen felt a little creeped out. "I have a feeling you're thinking of something impolite." [[20887 司辰 neutral]]
"Of course not~" [[20888 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng giggled. "The favor I need is actually part of the plan. You know about Taotao's current situation through Dr. Lin, right?" [[20889 池小橙 happy]]
Si Chen: "Yeah, I feel like she likes you, but I don't know what she's still hesitating about. She keeps holding back and doesn't dare to make a move. My plan is to give her some pressure so she has no choice but to go to you." [[20890 司辰 neutral]]
"Yes, that's it!" Chi Xiaocheng clapped her hands. Si Chen's words were exactly what she was thinking. [[20891 池小橙 happy]]
Talking to a smart person was so different. If it were Dongfang Yang, he'd still be stuck on the whole 'sister' thing. [[20892 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen immediately saw what she wanted to do and also understood Su Tao's current problem. [[20893 旁白 neutral]]
So Chi Xiaocheng went along with it, "Since I have amnesia right now, I think we can create a fake love rival. We can have someone pretend to like me to put pressure on Su Tao. What do you think?" [[20894 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen's eyes lit up. "That's a great idea!" [[20895 司辰 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng said with a grin, "You think it's a good idea too, right? Then I'm giving this task to you." [[20896 池小橙 happy]]
"No problem!" Si Chen nodded seriously. "As long as you can get Su Tao wrapped around your finger quickly, this is a piece of cake. I'll immediately send some handsome guys... oh no, for you two, it should be beautiful women to pursue you." [[20897 司辰 neutral]]
"How about the campus belle, a famous actress, or a popular idol? I can arrange it all." [[20898 司辰 neutral]]
"Uh..." Chi Xiaocheng was at a loss for words. "Do you think that kind of fake gesture would work?" [[20899 池小橙 neutral]]
A pursuit from a stranger wouldn't create much of a sense of crisis. It would be less effective than Ningning. [[20900 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, Chi Xiaocheng was trying to nurture Su Tao into a semi-yandere. What if she had an episode? [[20901 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't want strangers who had little to do with her to get hurt. [[20902 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng's question made Si Chen freeze. "If that won't work, then who should we get?" [[20903 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked Si Chen up and down. [[20904 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen froze for a moment, then looked himself up and down. [[20905 旁白 neutral]]
His body stiffened as a possibility suddenly occurred to him. [[20906 旁白 neutral]]
He pointed a finger at himself. "Me?" [[20907 司辰 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded lightly. [[20908 旁白 neutral]]
The famously rational young master finally couldn't hold it together. "No... Can I just call you 'sis'? I've already been honest with Su Tao. I know you two are in a near-romantic relationship." [[20909 司辰 sad]]
"I'm not like that idiot Dongfang Yang who still thinks you have a sisterly bond." [[20910 司辰 neutral]]
"I already know this, and she knows that I know. How can I pretend to like you?" [[20911 司辰 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng beckoned with her finger. "That's simple. You don't have to explicitly say you like me in front of her. Just praise me a lot, say you think I'm great, and come find me a few more times. She'll naturally start to overthink it." [[20912 池小橙 neutral]]
"This..." Si Chen was at a loss for words. [[20913 司辰 neutral]]
It wasn't impossible. [[20914 旁白 neutral]]
Given Su Tao's mental state, she would definitely overthink it. [[20915 旁白 neutral]]
But why did this suggestion feel like it had a chilling undertone? [[20916 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing him hesitate for a long time, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong?" [[20917 池小橙 neutral]]
"No, it's nothing." [[20918 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen shook his head, then nodded. "Let's go with that for now. You're also coming to the banquet tomorrow night, right? How about you don't come as my sister, but as my date? The effect would be better." [[20919 司辰 neutral]]
"No way!" Chi Xiaocheng refused without a second thought. "That kind of role is not okay, not even as a pretense." [[20920 池小橙 angry]]
My love for Taotao is unwavering. [[20921 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Si Chen could only agree reluctantly. [[20922 旁白 neutral]]
Well, anyway, I just have to act like I care a little about Chi Xiaocheng, and as for Su Tao... [[20923 旁白 neutral]]
Even if she becomes a bit abnormal later, she definitely won't be as scary as Chi Xiaocheng. [[20924 旁白 neutral]]
At most, Su Tao is just a little better at fighting than the average girl. Could she really take me out in one move? [[20925 旁白 neutral]]
Come on, she's only 166 cm tall, and I, Si Chen, am 190 cm! [[20926 旁白 neutral]]
After discussing the upcoming plans in more detail, Si Chen left. [[20927 旁白 neutral]]
The next day, as planned, he came to put some pressure on Su Tao. [[20928 旁白 neutral]]
His reason was that he needed to coordinate with Chi Xiaocheng about their personas for the banquet that night. [[20929 旁白 neutral]]
For Su Tao, the banquet was just something to do with Xiaocheng because she was bored. She was more looking forward to when Chi Xiaocheng couldn't walk and needed to be carried. [[20930 旁白 neutral]]
She felt a little uncomfortable but didn't think much of it. [[20931 旁白 neutral]]
Since Si Chen was there, she decided to go home for a bit. [[20932 旁白 neutral]]
What she found strange was that the cat food she had prepared for Da Wang two days ago was almost gone, and now the cat, which seemed to be getting smarter, was not at home. [[20933 旁白 neutral]]
She had prepared a five-day supply. [[20934 旁白 neutral]]
But after only two days, the cat food was gone. [[20935 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't figure it out and just assumed Da Wang's appetite had grown. [[20936 旁白 neutral]]
After watering the potted plants and refilling Da Wang's food, Su Tao spent the day practicing her acting. [[20937 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the mirror, she felt that it seemed quite easy to learn. [[20938 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, half the day had passed. [[20939 旁白 neutral]]
As evening approached, she went to Si Chen's house with Dongfang Yang. [[20940 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had already been discharged from the hospital with Si Chen. The hospital said she still needed IV drips, and as long as she returned before midnight, there wouldn't be a problem. [[20941 旁白 neutral]]
Sitting in the young master's car, Su Tao's phone buzzed nonstop with messages. [[20942 旁白 neutral]]
One was from Si Chen, asking when she would arrive. [[20943 旁白 neutral]]
One was from Chengcheng, chatting with her about Xiaocheng. [[20944 旁白 neutral]]
Another was from her middle school friend Tang Tang. She was also attending the banquet and excitedly asked when she could see her and Xiaocheng together. [[20945 旁白 neutral]]
This middle school friend seemed to be a bit of a shipper for her and Xiaocheng. [[20946 旁白 neutral]]
