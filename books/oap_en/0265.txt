Chapter 265: The next step to understanding a yandere is to become one? [[22556 旁白 neutral]]
The memory was wrong. [[22557 旁白 neutral]]
But within this flawed memory, the logic was correct. [[22558 旁白 neutral]]
Besides relying on people she knew, Su Tao had also researched memory disorders on her own. [[22559 旁白 neutral]]
Even jumbled memories are based on a mix of real-world logic and imagination. [[22560 旁白 neutral]]
Given Dongfang Yang's personality, he would indeed do the things Xiaocheng remembered. [[22561 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, Su Tao wouldn't have thought much of it. [[22562 旁白 neutral]]
But after learning that Dongfang Yang's bank card PIN was Chi Xiaocheng's birthday... [[22563 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's happy smile was a bit glaring. [[22564 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pressed her lips together. The acting skills she had practiced for days helped her hide her thoughts. [[22565 旁白 neutral]]
She forced a smile and said, "Oh, I see. Dongfang Yang is really nice to you, Xiaocheng." [[22566 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng giggled, as if his name had opened the floodgates. "Taotao, you don't know, but my boss is actually a tsundere. He's clearly a bit clumsy but pretends to be very smart." [[22567 池小橙 happy]]
"Let me tell you, last time..." [[22568 池小橙 happy]]
"And also, Dongfang Yang told me to call him 'boss' because..." [[22569 池小橙 happy]]
"It's not just Dongfang Yang, that guy Si Chen is the same. He looks so serious on the surface, but actually..." [[22570 池小橙 happy]]
The topic shifted from where Da Wang went to various stories about Dongfang Yang and Si Chen from her jumbled memories. [[22571 旁白 neutral]]
The important thing was that Chi Xiaocheng was very happy talking about these things. [[22572 旁白 neutral]]
She was full of—longing. [[22573 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a little heartbroken. She wanted to shout that she was the best one for Chi Xiaocheng. [[22574 旁白 sad]]
But she still didn't have the courage to break the status quo. [[22575 旁白 sad]]
Anyway... it's just a jumbled memory, right? [[22576 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Xiaocheng has a slight fondness for Si Chen and Dongfang Yang, they're back in the capital now. This New Year's Eve, it's just the two of us! [[22577 旁白 happy]]
With several days together, Su Tao believed their relationship could be mended. [[22578 旁白 neutral]]
They didn't do much, just chatted from morning until noon. It was only during lunch that Chi Xiaocheng mentioned something else. [[22579 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Su Tao, would it be okay if we added one more member to our New Year's celebration this year?" [[22580 池小橙 neutral]]
As soon as she said this, Su Tao immediately thought of another person. [[22581 旁白 neutral]]
The person who was the biggest threat to her. [[22582 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning! [[22583 旁白 angry]]
It's New Year's! Is she... is she even trying to intrude on my time alone with Xiaocheng! [[22584 旁白 angry]]
Su Tao stood up almost as a reflex. [[22585 旁白 angry]]
The word "No" was on the tip of her tongue, ready to burst out. But she had moved too suddenly, and a bowl of soup on the table tilted and spilled. [[22586 旁白 neutral]]
The hot soup splashed onto her hand, the pain overshadowing her anxiety. [[22587 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't have time to clean up. She quickly asked, "Xiaocheng... the person you mentioned, who... who is it?" [[22588 苏桃 sad]]
She was a little nervous, not wanting to hear that name. [[22589 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't answer, a worried look on her face. "Sister Su Tao, your hand..." [[22590 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao quickly shook her head. "I'm fine, it's just..." [[22591 苏桃 neutral]]
"How can you say you're fine!" Chi Xiaocheng's expression turned serious. She immediately grabbed some tissues and went to Su Tao's side. [[22592 池小橙 sad]]
After wiping the spill, she pulled her towards the kitchen. [[22593 旁白 neutral]]
"Your skin is all red. Rinse it with cold water first, I'll go get the medicine." [[22594 池小橙 sad]]
The girl's anxious back and swinging ponytail eased Su Tao's unease. [[22595 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng really cares about me—the thought suddenly rushed into Su Tao's mind. [[22596 旁白 happy]]
She looked down and saw her wrist was still red. [[22597 旁白 neutral]]
The stinging pain was hard to ignore. [[22598 旁白 neutral]]
But after the sting came the anxious expression of the girl she cared about. [[22599 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah... there's only a little bit of burn cream left. It looks watery, I can't get it out!" [[22600 池小橙 sad]]
"I think they say oil works too. Sister Su Tao, just bear with it for a moment, I'll search online." [[22601 池小橙 neutral]]
Perhaps because she was anxious, Chi Xiaocheng's movements were clumsy. [[22602 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao found that she strangely liked seeing her flustered. [[22603 旁白 happy]]
It wasn't that she was abnormal; Su Tao had always thought she was perfectly normal. [[22604 旁白 neutral]]
It was that the object of her anxiety was her. [[22605 旁白 happy]]
In the past, whenever Xiaocheng got hurt, she was the one who treated her. [[22606 旁白 neutral]]
Now, even though Su Tao knew how to quickly treat her own burn, she didn't want it to heal so easily. [[22607 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to see more of Xiaocheng's reactions. [[22608 旁白 happy]]
A strange smile appeared on Su Tao's lips. [[22609 旁白 happy]]
After rinsing her hand with cold water for a while, Su Tao hid her smile and asked softly, "Xiaocheng, how is it now?" [[22610 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng put down her phone helplessly. "There's no more medicine. I'll do some first aid, and then I'll go buy some more." [[22611 池小橙 neutral]]
With that, Chi Xiaocheng pulled Su Tao to the sofa. [[22612 旁白 neutral]]
She had Su Tao sit down and took her arm. [[22613 旁白 neutral]]
A blush appeared on her cheeks. [[22614 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng licked her lips, saying shyly, "I... I read online that saliva is good for burns... anyway, it's... it's just first aid. Don't... don't be grossed out." [[22615 池小橙 happy]]
Before Su Tao could even process this bold statement, she saw the girl lower her head. [[22616 旁白 neutral]]
A tingling sensation spread through her arm. Her brown hair fell, hiding her equally flushed earlobes. [[22617 旁白 neutral]]
Treatment, bandaging—after this series of gentle actions, Su Tao completely forgot about the new member Chi Xiaocheng had mentioned. [[22618 旁白 neutral]]
Did the burn hurt? [[22619 旁白 neutral]]
It hurt a lot. [[22620 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao felt very happy. [[22621 旁白 happy]]
Before, she didn't understand why Xiaocheng would self-harm in her yandere state. [[22622 旁白 neutral]]
Now, she could probably empathize. [[22623 旁白 neutral]]
When I get hurt, the one I care about will focus all her attention on me. [[22624 旁白 happy]]
Hehe, how despicable! [[22625 旁白 happy]]
But, I don't really hate it. [[22626 旁白 happy]]
This moment was Su Tao's "sweet" time, but this sweetness didn't last long before Chi Xiaocheng returned to the previous topic. [[22627 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps to hide her shyness, she turned her head and said, [[22628 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Su Tao, I just thought it might be boring with just the two of us for the New Year, so, I..." [[22629 池小橙 happy]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng could finish, a cat's meow suddenly came from outside the glass door. [[22630 旁白 neutral]]
The sound was loud, drawing both of their attention. [[22631 旁白 neutral]]
They turned to see that Da Wang had returned from outside. [[22632 旁白 neutral]]
Somehow, it had found a way up. The fifth-floor window was no obstacle for it. [[22633 旁白 neutral]]
But besides Da Wang, another white figure had jumped onto the balcony with it. [[22634 旁白 neutral]]
"Meow!" [[22635 大王 happy]]
Da Wang cried out from behind the glass door, then scratched it hard, as if asking why the window was closed. It couldn't get home because all the windows were shut. [[22636 旁白 neutral]]
Since she had seen the white Ragdoll cat with Da Wang before, Chi Xiaocheng wasn't too surprised. [[22637 旁白 neutral]]
She stood up and walked towards the balcony. [[22638 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao watched this and breathed a sigh of relief. [[22639 旁白 happy]]
Oh, so the new member Xiaocheng was talking about is this Ragdoll cat. [[22640 旁白 happy]]
That makes sense. Xiaocheng said "new member," not "new person." [[22641 旁白 happy]]
Haha, you scared me. [[22642 旁白 happy]]
I thought it was Fang Ning. [[22643 旁白 happy]]
"..." [[22644 旁白 neutral]]
For some reason, Su Tao looked at the closed bedroom door, and a sense of absurdity and unease washed over her. [[22645 旁白 sad]]
The New Year was supposed to be her and Xiaocheng's private time. [[22646 旁白 sad]]
She really didn't want a third person to intrude. [[22647 旁白 sad]]
Looking at Fang Ning without bias, she was a pretty well-behaved girl. [[22648 旁白 neutral]]
So it... probably isn't her, right? [[22649 旁白 sad]]
