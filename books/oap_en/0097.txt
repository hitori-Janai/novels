Chapter 97: Chi Xiaocheng's Psychological Report (Bonus chapter for "Ku Se Diao") [[8432 旁白 neutral]]
"Okay, Doctor." [[8433 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tried her best to stay calm, but it was impossible not to be nervous. [[8434 旁白 neutral]]
After all, she wasn't sure if her acting skills would work, and she also didn't know what questions the doctor would ask. [[8435 旁白 neutral]]
If the questions were tricky and targeted, she was afraid she wouldn't be able to answer them with just her acting. [[8436 旁白 neutral]]
But to Chi Xiaocheng's surprise, the doctor's questions didn't seem that tricky. [[8437 旁白 neutral]]
The first question was a common one. [[8438 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, is there anything that makes you feel stressed or anxious?" [[8439 陈医生 neutral]]
"Umm..." Faced with Doctor Chen's question, Chi Xiaocheng shook her head in confusion, "I don't think I've been under much stress lately." [[8440 池小橙 neutral]]
Doctor Chen asked again, "Then is there anything that makes you happy, like self-improvement or changes in your friends?" [[8441 陈医生 neutral]]
The question was very normal, as normal as it could be. [[8442 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought she should play along and followed Doctor Chen's lead, "There are quite a few things that make me happy, but the main one is that the misunderstanding with Taotao has been cleared up." [[8443 池小橙 happy]]
Doctor Chen's smile didn't change, "Is Taotao your friend? Can I hear your story?" [[8444 陈医生 neutral]]
"Of course." [[8445 池小橙 neutral]]
Making up a story, she could use the psychologist's report to give Su Tao a message: the original owner had always loved her. [[8446 旁白 neutral]]
As time went on, Chi Xiaocheng realized that Doctor Chen didn't seem to be asking questions specifically about her yandere tendencies. [[8447 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like he was really just checking on her psychological state. [[8448 旁白 neutral]]
Though they were doctor and patient, the conversation felt more like catching up with a friend she hadn't seen in years. [[8449 旁白 neutral]]
That's right, Taotao asked for a psychological diagnosis not to confirm if I'm a yandere. Maybe she already completely believes me and just wants to check on my mental state. [[8450 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps realizing that Doctor Chen was harmless and being subtly guided by him, Chi Xiaocheng told a story that was nine parts truth and one part lie, interspersed with her intermediate acting skills. [[8451 旁白 neutral]]
Just like that, she chatted with Doctor Chen for over an hour. [[8452 旁白 neutral]]
After coming out and drinking some water, she seamlessly moved on to Si Chen's Doctor Lin. [[8453 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Lin wore the same warm, spring-like smile as Doctor Chen, "Miss Chi, how was it? Was it stressful with Doctor Chen?" [[8454 林医生 neutral]]
"He only talked to me about daily life topics, it wasn't as tricky as I imagined." [[8455 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen was on her side, and Doctor Lin knew she was faking being a yandere, so Chi Xiaocheng didn't have to hide much. [[8456 旁白 neutral]]
She asked, "Doctor Lin, based on Si Chen's advice, does this mean the diagnosis report can't be written as we planned?" [[8457 池小橙 neutral]]
Doctor Lin nodded, "I'll need to compare my diagnosis with Doctor Chen's later. He doesn't know about your situation and thinks it's just a routine check-up." [[8458 林医生 neutral]]
"No wonder he didn't ask any targeted questions." [[8459 池小橙 neutral]]
Doctor Lin: "Miss Chi, I'll also ask you some routine questions. It wouldn't be good if I have nothing to say for the report." [[8460 林医生 neutral]]
"Okay, thank you, Doctor Lin. If the report can't be done, don't force it." [[8461 池小橙 neutral]]
"Mhm." [[8462 林医生 neutral]]
Doctor Lin had a kind smile and a gentle voice. During their conversation, Chi Xiaocheng felt the same way she did with Doctor Chen. [[8463 旁白 neutral]]
Like a warm spring breeze. [[8464 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to her own impersonation of Doctor Cheng, these two were far superior in both their attention to detail and the rigor of their questions. [[8465 旁白 neutral]]
She even had a feeling at that moment that if Su Tao had investigated her "Doctor Cheng" persona more deeply, she might not have been able to hide it. [[8466 旁白 neutral]]
There had been too many loopholes in their previous chats. [[8467 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, while she didn't know anything about psychology, Su Tao was just as clueless. [[8468 旁白 neutral]]
The only thing Chi Xiaocheng found a bit regrettable was that she couldn't use this diagnosis to put more pressure on Su Tao. [[8469 旁白 neutral]]
During the questioning, because they were acquainted, Doctor Lin's questions were much more aggressive than Doctor Chen's. [[8470 旁白 neutral]]
But most of them, like Doctor Chen's, were about her daily life with Su Tao. [[8471 旁白 neutral]]
Near the end, Doctor Lin took a sip of water and said in a soft voice, "From a professional psychologist's perspective, Miss Chi, you are indeed not a possessive or dependent type of yandere." [[8472 林医生 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng confidently put her hands on her hips, "I already said that a yandere wouldn't know they are a yandere. I know exactly what I'm doing, and I'm rationally playing the part of a possessive and dependent yandere for Taotao, so of course I'm not a real one." [[8473 池小橙 happy]]
Doctor Lin nodded lightly, "Your acting is excellent, even better than many students from the acting academy I know." [[8474 林医生 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng touched her hair shyly, "Maybe it's a gift." [[8475 池小橙 happy]]
Doctor Lin went along with her, "Finally, could I test your acting skills? I know an old professor who is looking for a student, and he insists I recommend someone. If you're willing, I'd like you to meet him. It's always good to have another option." [[8476 林医生 neutral]]
"Of course." [[8477 池小橙 happy]]
Without much thought, Chi Xiaocheng secretly activated her intermediate acting skills and kept her expression calm, "Go ahead, Doctor Lin. How would you like me to perform?" [[8478 池小橙 neutral]]
"I'll say a line, and you act like a yandere?" [[8479 林医生 neutral]]
"OK!" [[8480 池小橙 happy]]
Doctor Lin smiled slightly, interlocked her fingers, and rested her index fingers on her lips. Her eyes suddenly turned gloomy and intense. "Actually, Master Si Chen still likes Miss Su Tao, he just doesn't tell you." [[8481 林医生 neutral]]
Instantly, a dangerous glint flashed in Chi Xiaocheng's crimson eyes. [[8482 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice deepened slightly, "Doctor Lin, are you telling the truth?" [[8483 池小橙 angry]]
Doctor Lin spread her hands and chuckled lightly, "Of course I'm kidding. Your acting is amazing!" [[8484 林医生 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng was stunned for a moment, then said proudly as usual, "Of course, I can handle Taotao easily." [[8485 池小橙 happy]]
With that, she stood up, "I'll leave the report to you, Doctor Lin. If you need my help with anything, you can have Si Chen contact me. Also, about my situation..." [[8486 池小橙 neutral]]
"Don't worry." Doctor Lin stood up and touched the recording pen on the desk. "This pen is out of battery. As a psychologist, I have professional ethics. We're just friends who hit it off, aren't we?" [[8487 林医生 neutral]]
After shaking hands with Doctor Lin, Chi Xiaocheng felt much more at ease. [[8488 旁白 neutral]]
Her alert skill gave no feedback. [[8489 旁白 neutral]]
If Doctor Lin had any ill intentions with her information, the intermediate alert skill would have definitely detected it. [[8490 旁白 neutral]]
Not long after Chi Xiaocheng left, Si Chen arrived. [[8491 旁白 neutral]]
The two doctors cross-referenced their findings, with Doctor Lin responsible for summarizing. She said in front of Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, and Su Tao, "According to the diagnostic report, Miss Chi is currently under a relatively severe state of high pressure." [[8492 林医生 neutral]]
"High pressure?" Su Tao was the first to ask, "I think Xiaocheng seems very normal usually." [[8493 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen cast a doubtful glance at Su Tao, as if to say: You really think Chi Xiaocheng is normal? [[8494 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang, who understood nothing, nodded along with Su Tao, "I also think she's quite normal, just a bit dumb. Are you sure her intelligence is okay?" [[8495 东方阳 neutral]]
Doctor Chen added, "Young Master, please put away your prejudice. Miss Chi's apparent normality is actually because she is subconsciously suppressing and hiding this pressure. Her stress comes mostly from insecurity and anxiety." [[8496 陈医生 neutral]]
"And she gives me a very contradictory feeling." [[8497 陈医生 neutral]]
"Contradictory?" [[8498 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes." Doctor Chen pushed up his glasses. "I feel like she is always playing the role of someone else." [[8499 陈医生 neutral]]
