Chapter 51 Love Her, Give Her Everything [[4440 旁白 neutral]]
Her dry throat was soothed, and a warm current seemed to flow through her entire body. [[4441 旁白 neutral]]
The water was gradually finished. [[4442 旁白 neutral]]
But her breathing became increasingly difficult. [[4443 旁白 neutral]]
No... I can't breathe anymore. [[4444 旁白 neutral]]
"Hoo-ha—" [[4445 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, just as she reached her limit, Su Tao's vision cleared again. She gasped for air, tears seemingly welling up in her eyes, and looked at Chi Xiaocheng with difficulty. [[4446 旁白 neutral]]
The small loli blinked, seemingly understanding Su Tao's meaning. [[4447 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled faintly, "Tao Tao, do you want to ask why? Because I like you!" [[4448 池小橙 happy]]
"There's still half a glass of water left." [[4449 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's chest heaved continuously. She shook her head and said, "No need, I'm not thirsty... no need." [[4450 苏桃 sad]]
"No!" [[4451 池小橙 angry]]
Her body was weak, and she couldn't refuse Chi Xiaocheng's feeding. Soon, her breathing became difficult again. [[4452 旁白 neutral]]
The time was short, yet long. [[4453 旁白 neutral]]
By the time Su Tao regained consciousness, Chi Xiaocheng had already placed a small incense burner on the table. [[4454 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, you're sick, so you can't leave until you're well. I've tried this little gadget, and it can help you relax your body. Now, just rest assured~" [[4455 池小橙 neutral]]
After saying that, she picked up a stack of books as if tidying up the room and walked towards the door. [[4456 旁白 neutral]]
The stack of books was heavy, and Chi Xiaocheng swayed as she walked. [[4457 旁白 neutral]]
One of the books suddenly fell from her arms, but she didn't seem to notice. [[4458 旁白 neutral]]
She continued to walk forward until she left the room. [[4459 旁白 neutral]]
It was then that Su Tao gradually regained a little strength. [[4460 旁白 neutral]]
But only a little. She could barely get up. She felt like she couldn't even lift a kettle of water now. [[4461 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao leaned against the headboard, covering her head with a headache, frowning to herself, "What exactly is going on? Am I... being restricted by Xiaocheng now?" [[4462 苏桃 sad]]
Her fingers unconsciously brushed her lips, forcing herself to think rationally. [[4463 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, when she could get out of bed, she began to observe the room. [[4464 旁白 neutral]]
"From the layout, it's undoubtedly Xiaocheng's room." [[4465 苏桃 neutral]]
"The windows are sealed, with breathing holes." [[4466 苏桃 neutral]]
"There's no way to see outside through the breathing holes. From the sound, the rain has already lessened." [[4467 苏桃 neutral]]
"How long have I been asleep? Has this rain been continuous, or is it the second rain that has been falling for a long time?" [[4468 苏桃 neutral]]
After checking, Su Tao slumped back onto the bed, her gaze fixed on the only exit—the door. [[4469 旁白 neutral]]
But would Xiaocheng let her out? [[4470 旁白 neutral]]
Why would she do this? [[4471 旁白 neutral]]
After much thought, Su Tao could only force a bitter smile of regret. [[4472 旁白 neutral]]
Because of the test. [[4473 旁白 neutral]]
In this situation, whether she was playing a yandere or not, she could easily cover it up, right? [[4474 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao got up and picked up the book Chi Xiaocheng had dropped on the floor. [[4475 旁白 neutral]]
"What a careless fellow, full of flaws." [[4476 苏桃 neutral]]
She looked at the title. [[4477 旁白 neutral]]
"Love Her, Give Her Everything" [[4478 旁白 neutral]]
The cover showed two girls embracing, surrounded by blood-red roses. [[4479 旁白 neutral]]
"Does Xiaocheng usually read romance light novels like this?" [[4480 苏桃 neutral]]
Since she had nothing to do, she might as well learn about Xiaocheng's preferences. [[4481 旁白 neutral]]
Although she was restricted, Su Tao was still relatively calm. She knew that Chi Xiaocheng wouldn't harm her, and she could easily subdue her once she recovered. [[4482 旁白 neutral]]
She just had to wait a little longer. [[4483 旁白 neutral]]
She opened the table of contents, and the content shocked Su Tao! [[4484 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 1: I like you. [[4485 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 2: I love you! [[4486 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 3: Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you! [[4487 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 4: Hand, do you like it? [[4488 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 5: It hurts a little, but the porridge, is it delicious? [[4489 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 6: Do you still like me, even though I'm so incomplete? [[4490 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 7: You said you were just coaxing me? [[4491 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 8: Are you afraid of me? [[4492 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 9: It's okay, I love you. [[4493 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 10: Forever together. [[4494 旁白 neutral]]
—End. [[4495 旁白 neutral]]
"What... what is this!" [[4496 苏桃 sad]]
Her hand trembled, and Su Tao was so scared that she couldn't even hold the book. [[4497 旁白 neutral]]
The content described in this book was undoubtedly about yanderes! [[4498 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Su Tao couldn't help but recall what Si Chen had said. [[4499 旁白 neutral]]
A person's personality can change due to social environmental factors. With more exposure, at a naive age where they can't distinguish right from wrong, they will unconsciously lean towards that side. [[4500 旁白 neutral]]
Even yearn for it. [[4501 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao swallowed hard, "Xiaocheng has been... reading this kind of book for a long time?" [[4502 苏桃 sad]]
No, maybe the table of contents is just a gimmick. [[4503 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao picked up the novel and casually opened a page. [[4504 旁白 neutral]]
The content was: The female lead asked the second female lead what she liked about her, and the second female lead replied that she liked soft little hands. The next day, the female lead cut off her own hand, wrapped it in diamonds and crystals, made it into a specimen, and gave it to the second female lead. [[4505 旁白 neutral]]
Horrifying! [[4506 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt cold sweat break out on her back. This scene seemed familiar. [[4507 旁白 neutral]]
"Creak~" [[4508 旁白 neutral]]
The door opened. [[4509 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao immediately hid the book behind her back, and a hint of fear appeared in her eyes as she looked at Chi Xiaocheng. [[4510 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao, tilting her head in confusion, "Tao Tao, why are you looking at me like that? You're sick, and I'm taking care of you." [[4511 池小橙 neutral]]
Saying that, she walked in holding a bowl of soup. [[4512 旁白 neutral]]
"Time to eat." [[4513 池小橙 neutral]]
Her demeanor was perfectly normal, as if she was truly taking care of a sick person. [[4514 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's smile stiffened. She stared intently at the bowl of soup in front of her, the hand holding the book behind her back trembling slightly. [[4515 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng... actually, I... I'm not very hungry yet. How about we chat instead?" [[4516 苏桃 neutral]]
"Not hungry?" Chi Xiaocheng's meaningful gaze flashed and disappeared. She smiled innocently, "Tao Tao must be hungry after sleeping for so long. Come on, let's eat first. The takeout I just ordered should be delicious." [[4517 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao let out a long sigh when she heard this. [[4518 旁白 neutral]]
She was so nervous that she had forgotten that the Chi Xiaocheng she knew couldn't cook. [[4519 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, that was a novel after all. [[4520 旁白 neutral]]
It was a novel after all. [[4521 旁白 neutral]]
Secretly wiping away cold sweat, Su Tao heard Chi Xiaocheng ask again, "Tao Tao, have you regained some strength? Can you eat by yourself, or do you need me to feed you?" [[4522 池小橙 neutral]]
"No... no need." Su Tao thought of the scene where she was fed water just now and quickly waved her hand, "I'll eat by myself." [[4523 苏桃 neutral]]
However, what puzzled her was that a long time seemed to have passed, yet why hadn't her strength recovered? [[4524 旁白 neutral]]
She was still only able to move with difficulty. [[4525 旁白 neutral]]
Before she could think further, Chi Xiaocheng had already pulled up a chair and sat opposite her, her hands obediently placed on her thighs, her crimson pupils looking at her expectantly. [[4526 旁白 neutral]]
As if she wanted to watch her drink the soup first, then eat. [[4527 旁白 neutral]]
After such a long time, Su Tao was indeed hungry. [[4528 旁白 neutral]]
She could only regain her strength by eating. [[4529 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao scooped up the old hen soup with green onions and carefully sniffed it. [[4530 旁白 neutral]]
There was no strange smell. It was indeed like the kind from outside shops, with a lot of MSG, smelling strong. [[4531 旁白 neutral]]
She blew on it a few times to cool it down. [[4532 旁白 neutral]]
And brought it to her mouth. [[4533 旁白 neutral]]
But... the moment it entered her mouth, Su Tao's hands trembled violently. [[4534 旁白 neutral]]
The spoon fell to the floor with a clinking sound. [[4535 旁白 neutral]]
Her terrified gaze fell upon Chi Xiaocheng. The small loli had, at some point, leaned forward slightly. [[4536 旁白 neutral]]
Her knees were pressed against her thighs, and her hands cupped her face, smiling as she looked at her. [[4537 旁白 neutral]]
"Why aren't you eating, Tao Tao... is it not delicious?" [[4538 池小橙 neutral]]
... [[4539 旁白 neutral]]
