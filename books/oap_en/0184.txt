Chapter 184: This Time, the Dream is Sweet [[16071 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the door opened, time seemed to stand still. [[16072 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang, with a scarecrow in its mouth, had jumped onto the sofa. Hearing the door open, it immediately turned its head to look. [[16073 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the scarecrow in its mouth was frozen in a strange posture, staring toward her room. [[16074 旁白 neutral]]
One arm was raised high, the other seemed to be pulling Da Wang's whiskers, and its legs were frozen in a kicking motion. [[16075 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if the scarecrow had been alive and was abruptly forced to stop its movements. [[16076 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, its crystal-red eyes felt inexplicably familiar. [[16077 旁白 neutral]]
The air conditioner wasn't on, so Su Tao just took off her tall boots and stepped onto the layers of blankets Chi Xiaocheng had laid out before. [[16078 旁白 neutral]]
She picked up the remote and turned on the air conditioner. [[16079 苏桃 neutral]]
Instantly, Da Wang excitedly carried the scarecrow over to Su Tao's side. [[16080 旁白 happy]]
It dropped the scarecrow on the floor and happily rubbed against her clean, odorless white socks. [[16081 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao couldn't help but squat down and pat Da Wang's head. "After Xiaocheng left, the last time you were this happy was at the cafe. It's great to see you gradually getting back to your old self, Da Wang." [[16082 苏桃 happy]]
"But when did we get this doll?" [[16083 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao used her index finger and thumb to pick up one of the scarecrow's feet. [[16084 旁白 neutral]]
Holding it up to her face, she had a strange feeling that the scarecrow was breaking out in a cold sweat. [[16085 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems alive. It must be my imagination, right?" [[16086 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao easily bent the scarecrow's limbs back into a normal position and placed the doll on the table. [[16087 旁白 neutral]]
She just assumed Da Wang had been playing with it and turned to walk toward her room. [[16088 旁白 neutral]]
This made Chi Xiaocheng, who was tense and stiff, let out a sigh of relief. [[16089 池小橙 neutral]]
Good thing I wasn't exposed, or Su Tao would have been terrified. [[16090 池小橙 neutral]]
Then, she glared fiercely at Da Wang, who was approaching again. "You stupid cat, when I get my body back, I'm going to cook you!" [[16091 池小橙 angry]]
"Meow~" [[16092 大王 neutral]]
Da Wang stuck out its big tongue and licked the scarecrow's face, making the cloth damp. [[16093 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao walk out of the room with clothes, Chi Xiaocheng felt helpless and had to let Da Wang play with her. [[16094 旁白 neutral]]
The moment Su Tao turned and walked into the bathroom, she secretly took out her status glasses to check the girl's condition. [[16095 池小橙 neutral]]
[Su Tao] [[16096 系统 neutral]]
[Height: 166] [[16097 系统 neutral]]
[Weight: 97→95] [[16098 系统 neutral]]
[Bust: C] [[16099 系统 neutral]]
[Current Status: Moderate Stress, Listless, Haggard, Weak, Poor Appetite, Self-Denial, Excessive Self-Blame, Self-Isolation] [[16100 系统 neutral]]
[Normal Favorability Toward Host: 97→99 (In her subconscious, you are an indispensable person in her life. She has belatedly realized your importance and is reluctant to let you go.)] [[16101 系统 neutral]]
[Romantic Favorability Toward Host: 49→56 (She has a preliminary concept of 'like' and thinks she might like you a little, but this concept isn't deep. Her views on gender are still a significant obstacle, and she is eager to understand what 'like' truly is.)] [[16102 系统 neutral]]
[Possessive Favorability Toward Host: 31→27 (With people like Fang Ning who see you as their one and only, and since you are already 'dead', she believes she shouldn't selfishly possess you. Otherwise, your existence wouldn't remain in anyone else's memory. When a person is forgotten by everyone in the world, that is true death.)] [[16103 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points Needed for Status Glasses Upgrade: 1500] [[16104 系统 neutral]]
The numbers hadn't changed much, but what Chi Xiaocheng cared about most was Su Tao's weight. [[16105 旁白 sad]]
At home, Chi Xiaocheng knew Su Tao's daily routine and diet. [[16106 旁白 neutral]]
She would stare blankly until midnight before lying down. Even if she couldn't sleep, she would just stay in bed. After waking up, she would still lie there until noon before slowly getting up. [[16107 旁白 sad]]
She'd cook some rice, see what leftovers were in the fridge, and her simplest meal would be an egg with some pickled mustard, taking just a few bites to call it a meal. [[16108 旁白 sad]]
In just a few days, she had lost another two pounds. [[16109 旁白 sad]]
Seeing this made Chi Xiaocheng's heart ache. [[16110 池小橙 sad]]
The changes in favorability seemed less important compared to her weight loss. [[16111 旁白 neutral]]
"But at least her spirits seem a bit better, a little more lively." [[16112 池小橙 happy]]
[Perhaps she met someone today who helped her sort out her feelings and thoughts.] [[16113 系统 neutral]]
"That's good." [[16114 池小橙 happy]]
The sweet dream Chi Xiaocheng had prepared was meant to help Su Tao relieve her stress. [[16115 旁白 neutral]]
And now… [[16116 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the 56 points in romantic favorability, a hint of anticipation touched Chi Xiaocheng's lips. [[16117 旁白 happy]]
Let's hope it goes up to 60 in one go! [[16118 池小橙 happy]]
While Su Tao was still in the shower, Chi Xiaocheng snuck into the room, luring Da Wang in with her. This would explain why a doll that was just in the living room suddenly appeared in the bedroom. [[16119 旁白 neutral]]
Lying on the floor, Chi Xiaocheng waited for about half an hour before Su Tao came out of the bathroom. [[16120 旁白 neutral]]
Her light pajamas were once again a feast for the eyes. [[16121 旁白 neutral]]
She placed Chi Xiaocheng back among the pile of dolls and sat on the bed. [[16122 旁白 neutral]]
First, she took out the old suicide note and looked at it for a long time. Then, she took out her phone and sent a message to Dr. Cheng. [[16123 旁白 neutral]]
Getting no reply, she turned off the light and slowly lay down. [[16124 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry, Xiaocheng. From now on... I won't run away anymore." [[16125 苏桃 sad]]
She lay on her side, hugging the large brown teddy bear and whispering in the darkness. [[16126 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps because she had figured things out, or maybe she was just really tired, Su Tao fell into a deep sleep shortly after. [[16127 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng quietly climbed next to Su Tao, looking at her peaceful profile with a fond smile. [[16128 池小橙 happy]]
"Taotao, I was never mad at you." [[16129 池小橙 happy]]
"You've worked so hard, holding on all by yourself for so long." [[16130 池小橙 sad]]
"Tonight, have a sweet dream~" [[16131 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng snuggled into Su Tao's arms, feeling the warmth and softness, and said in her mind. [[16132 旁白 neutral]]
"System, use the new dream-invitation item I bought." [[16133 池小橙 neutral]]
[Yes, Host.] [[16134 系统 neutral]]
Weaving a dream and inviting her in. [[16135 旁白 neutral]]
For a long time, sleeping was something Su Tao had avoided. [[16136 旁白 sad]]
Because she would dream, and the content of her dreams was uncontrollable. [[16137 旁白 sad]]
Especially after those two lucid dreams, the scenes of Chi Xiaocheng being tortured to death by Ye Liang, or hiding in city trash cans and sewers, would constantly reappear in her dreams. [[16138 旁白 sad]]
Even though she would forget most of it upon waking, some deep, vivid memories always remained. [[16139 旁白 sad]]
After waking up, she felt even more exhausted than before she went to sleep. [[16140 旁白 sad]]
She even began to numbly get used to these dreams. [[16141 旁白 sad]]
Just like now, when she opened her eyes and felt a warm spring breeze instead of her familiar room and blanket, Su Tao already knew. [[16142 旁白 neutral]]
"Am I dreaming again?" [[16143 苏桃 sad]]
She closed her eyes, a bitter smile on her lips. [[16144 旁白 sad]]
"God, you are too cruel. Xiaocheng is already dead, yet you keep torturing her in my dreams." [[16145 苏桃 angry]]
And torturing me at the same time. [[16146 苏桃 sad]]
Since she's already gone, can't you just let her leave happily? [[16147 苏桃 sad]]
Why do you have to torture her in my dreams? [[16148 苏桃 sad]]
Isn't this just a constant reminder that it was because of my refusal and avoidance that Xiaocheng couldn't be happy when she left! [[16149 苏桃 sad]]
In the end, it's just another numbing cycle. [[16150 苏桃 sad]]
However, the moment she closed her eyes, a small, warm hand took hers. [[16151 旁白 happy]]
Beside her ear was that familiar and deeply missed, soft voice, "Taotao, what are you spacing out for? Saying things like I'm dead. I've been alive and well all this time." [[16152 池小橙 happy]]
The girl's eyes shot open. The person she had been longing for was standing right in front of her. [[16153 旁白 happy]]
Her smile was as bright as a flower. [[16154 旁白 happy]]
This time, the dream was sweet. [[16155 旁白 happy]]
