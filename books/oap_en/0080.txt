Chapter 80 Link by Link [[7002 旁白 neutral]]
Sitting in the hospital room, Chi Xiaocheng waited for a long time but didn't hear Su Tao's reply. [[7003 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled even more happily. [[7004 旁白 neutral]]
But the old voice, produced by the pseudovoice skill, carried a hint of absentmindedness and disbelief, "Xiao... Xiao Tao, Xiaocheng... did something happen to her?" [[7005 池母 sad]]
A mother regards her daughter as her only one. [[7006 旁白 neutral]]
But she couldn't get any news from her daughter. [[7007 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if the sky had fallen. [[7008 旁白 neutral]]
And pressed down on Su Tao. [[7009 旁白 neutral]]
This white moonlight female lead quickly forced a smile, her tone light and comforting, "Auntie, what are you talking about? Of course Xiaocheng is fine. It's very cold here in Jiuzhou City, and Xiaocheng just fell asleep not long ago because of a cold. Her phone is on silent." [[7010 苏桃 neutral]]
The old voice on the phone breathed a sigh of relief, "That's good, that's good. Xiaocheng's brother has been gone for so long and hasn't sent any news. If anything else happens to Xiaocheng... your uncle and I don't know what we'd do." [[7011 池母 sad]]
Su Tao's smile gradually stiffened. [[7012 旁白 neutral]]
The old voice didn't stop. Old people liked to repeat meaningless words, "Xiao Tao, it's really great that you're by Xiaocheng's side." [[7013 池母 neutral]]
"This child's personality has always been difficult since she was little, and she's easily bullied. We two old folks only know how to farm. We've already disappointed Xiaocheng's brother. If it weren't for you, we really wouldn't know what to do." [[7014 池母 sad]]
"Xiao Tao, thank you for being a pillar of support and letting Xiaocheng rely on you. I'm relieved to entrust that child to you." [[7015 池母 neutral]]
Listening to the relieved tone, Su Tao's stiff smile gradually turned bitter, "You're welcome, Auntie. You and Uncle raised me when I was little. As her older sister, of course I'll take good care of Xiaocheng." [[7016 苏桃 neutral]]
"Did you just coax Xiaocheng to sleep?" [[7017 池母 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Mm." [[7018 苏桃 neutral]]
"That child, she's still the same as before, she won't sleep unless she's hugging you. She's really a girl who won't grow up." [[7019 池母 neutral]]
Every word was filled with memories and happiness, which made Su Tao's heart even more bitter. [[7020 旁白 neutral]]
She was afraid. [[7021 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to escape. [[7022 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to forget everything and live an easy life alone. That seemed good too. [[7023 旁白 neutral]]
But in her heart, she could never quite let go of that small figure. [[7024 旁白 neutral]]
Like a thorny rose, holding it would constantly prick and sting her. [[7025 旁白 neutral]]
Even with Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao had thoughts of escaping, but only with Chi's father and mother, she dared not think that way. [[7026 旁白 neutral]]
As a low-income household, it was already very difficult for them to raise Chi Song and Chi Xiaocheng. [[7027 旁白 neutral]]
But when Chi Xiaocheng brought her home, the old couple still accepted her without hesitation. [[7028 旁白 neutral]]
Because of her, the whole family was often talked about by neighbors. [[7029 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she was an outsider, the old couple still raised her as their own daughter. [[7030 旁白 neutral]]
Buying clothes, buying toys, supporting her education, allowing her, an orphan since childhood, to feel the warmth of home and family. [[7031 旁白 neutral]]
Only Chi's father and mother, Su Tao could not fail, and dared not fail. [[7032 旁白 neutral]]
In her ear, another heavy male voice sounded. [[7033 旁白 neutral]]
It was Chi's father's slightly hoarse, smoky voice: "It's a pity Xiao Tao isn't a boy, otherwise it would be good to marry Xiaocheng off to him." [[7034 池父 neutral]]
As soon as these words came out, they were met with a scolding from Chi's mother, "Old man, what nonsense are you talking about? Chi Song is here to carry on the family line. Do you really want to marry Xiaocheng off? Even if I have to raise two daughters for the rest of my life, I'm willing!" [[7035 池母 angry]]
After scolding him, her voice softened towards Su Tao, "Xiao Tao, don't listen to your uncle's nonsense. You two decide your own matters. I won't bother you." [[7036 池母 neutral]]
"It's okay, no bother." [[7037 苏桃 neutral]]
"Mm-hmm, then I'll hang up first. Xiao Tao, Xiaocheng is entrusted to you." [[7038 池母 neutral]]
With that, the call ended. [[7039 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sat down on the sofa in a daze, her mind filled with Chi's mother's last words. [[7040 旁白 neutral]]
—Xiaocheng is entrusted to you. [[7041 旁白 neutral]]
The old couple's care, expectations, satisfaction, and happiness were all poured onto her. [[7042 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, with such heavy love, are you really going to ignore me?" [[7043 池小橙 neutral]]
Hanging up the phone, putting it down, Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved into a happy smile. [[7044 旁白 neutral]]
She thought she would soon see Su Tao in this hospital room. [[7045 旁白 neutral]]
Although the hacker toolset drawn from the system was not advanced, borrowing the original owner's mother's number was still very simple. [[7046 旁白 neutral]]
Just as the phone call said. [[7047 旁白 neutral]]
I, myself, have entrusted myself to you, Tao Tao. [[7048 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao, sitting in the living room, leaned back on the sofa and closed her eyes. All the complex emotions she had hidden deep in her heart for Chi Xiaocheng were brought out by a single phone call. [[7049 旁白 neutral]]
What should she do now? [[7050 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone and aimlessly scrolled through the content, not knowing what she was looking at, just scrolling randomly. [[7051 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was still watching the confused girl on the monitor. [[7052 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone again, "System, what do you think Tao Tao needs most right now?" [[7053 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, your comfort? Or your normal side?] [[7054 系统 neutral]]
"I've always been normal." Chi Xiaocheng corrected the system's slip of the tongue and slowly said, "What Tao Tao needs now is a fulcrum, a belief, a goal to move forward." [[7055 池小橙 neutral]]
"To make her take responsibility for me, the pressure from the original owner's parents isn't enough. Even if she comes to the hospital, she'll only come 'forced' to take care of me." [[7056 池小橙 neutral]]
"She must take the initiative." [[7057 池小橙 neutral]]
[Then what should we do next?] [[7058 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled faintly, "Next, it's naturally Doctor Orange's turn to appear." [[7059 池小橙 neutral]]
"Tao Tao has a heart problem, it needs to be treated!" [[7060 池小橙 neutral]]
Just as she was feeling confused, with a ding, a familiar person replied. [[7061 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly sat up, her face filled with joy. [[7062 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Sorry, I've been busy all day. How is your friend Orange doing now?" [[7063 成医生 neutral]]
Peach: "Doctor Cheng, let me tell you what happened first." [[7064 苏桃 neutral]]
Because they were online and didn't know each other, their realities would never overlap. [[7065 旁白 neutral]]
Coupled with the fact that Doctor Cheng had helped Su Tao a lot before, she subconsciously trusted him completely. [[7066 旁白 neutral]]
She told Doctor Cheng the entire process of what happened between Chi Xiaocheng and Ye Liang in great detail. [[7067 旁白 neutral]]
After she finished speaking, Doctor Cheng stopped replying, as if in silence. [[7068 旁白 neutral]]
The waiting time was agonizing for Su Tao. Three minutes felt like half an hour. [[7069 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "So, you don't know what to do now?" [[7070 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Mm, I... she's like that, I'm a little scared of her. Doctor Cheng, think about it, this time she hurt herself to make me break up with Ye Liang. What about next time, the time after that?" [[7071 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao: "I even thought just now, why not just let it go? I can't easily tell others about this, and it's so uncomfortable to keep it bottled up." [[7072 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng: "I think I understand what you mean." [[7073 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao urgently sent a message: "Doctor Cheng, do you have any solutions?" [[7074 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "She makes you feel pain, confusion, depression, fear, and even difficulty breathing, right?" [[7075 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao swallowed, "Yes, I know she didn't do it on purpose, but... she just unconsciously puts a lot of pressure on me. I... I don't know what to do." [[7076 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng: "(Yellow bean sigh)" [[7077 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "If you continue in your current state, you'll collapse first. I only have one suggestion." [[7078 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Send her to a mental hospital." [[7079 成医生 neutral]]
