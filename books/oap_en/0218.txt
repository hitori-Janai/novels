Chapter 218: A Strange Sense of Disconnection [[18959 旁白 neutral]]
Her body, fallen on the ground, trembled slightly. Her horrified eyes showed deep shock. The girl's voice wasn't loud, but it echoed endlessly in Su Tao's ears. [[18960 旁白 neutral]]
What are you going crazy for... [[18961 池小橙 angry]]
When did I ever like you... [[18962 池小橙 angry]]
Going crazy? [[18963 苏桃 sad]]
I'm confessing to you. Isn't this what you always wanted me to do? From a long, long time ago, and right before you died after being hit by the bullet, didn't you want me to confess to you? [[18964 苏桃 sad]]
And haven't you always liked me? [[18965 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao really hoped this was a prank, a joke, just a way for Chi Xiaocheng to tease her. [[18966 旁白 neutral]]
But when she looked up and met the other's eyes, which seemed annoyed yet held a hint of pity, Su Tao's heart sank to the bottom. [[18967 旁白 neutral]]
She struggled to get up from the floor and took a step toward Chi Xiaocheng's bed. "Xiaocheng, tell me, this is a joke, right?" [[18968 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned. "Stop." [[18969 池小橙 angry]]
"I..." [[18970 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao felt a pang in her heart but suppressed it, asking urgently, "Xiaocheng, are you... are you hating me? I know I made a lot of mistakes while you were asleep. I hesitated for a long time and even thought about giving up on you, but... but I..." [[18971 苏桃 sad]]
"But I've already decided to change. I like you, I want to be with you, and I want to make up for the mistakes I made. Haven't you always liked me? You clearly said you wanted to be with me before!" [[18972 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao placed a hand over her heart, her voice growing louder. "Xiaocheng, can you please stop fooling around?" [[18973 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's expression remained somewhat indifferent. Seeing Su Tao's state, her tone softened slightly. "First, please don't say things like you like me or want to be with me again. I'm a normal person, and I've only ever thought of you as a sister." [[18974 池小橙 neutral]]
"Second, I have never liked you. I don't know what kind of dream you've been having, but please wake up." [[18975 池小橙 neutral]]
"As for mistakes and making up for them, say whatever you want. But right now, I don't want to see you. Please leave!" [[18976 池小橙 angry]]
"The fact that I'm still calling you Sister Su Tao is already because I'm considering our previously good relationship." [[18977 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's hand, which had been massaging her shoulder, pointed to the hospital room door. "Let me say it one last time, seriously. I-do-not-like-you!" [[18978 池小橙 angry]]
The words came out of her mouth, each one serious and forceful, finally causing Su Tao to stumble weakly. [[18979 旁白 neutral]]
She could tell from Chi Xiaocheng's expression. [[18980 旁白 neutral]]
This wasn't a joke. [[18981 旁白 neutral]]
She was serious about what she said. [[18982 旁白 neutral]]
Why did it turn out like this? Is it because I gave up on myself after Xiaocheng died? [[18983 苏桃 sad]]
But Xiaocheng was still asleep, so even if I gave up on myself, she wouldn't know, right? [[18984 苏桃 sad]]
Before she died, lying in my arms, she was waiting for my confession. Why would she say something like this now? [[18985 苏桃 sad]]
Is it because of the mistakes I made in the past? [[18986 苏桃 sad]]
Thinking of this possibility, Su Tao's lips trembled. As if losing her mind, she moved closer to Chi Xiaocheng. "Xiaocheng, I know I was wrong to avoid and reject you all those times you confessed to me. So please, can you forgive me?" [[18987 苏桃 sad]]
"You don't really hate me, right? And saying you don't like me is just a joke, right?" [[18988 苏桃 sad]]
"No... Xiaocheng, say something! You're lying to me, right? You used to like me so much, and now you suddenly say you hate me... If you were trying to scare me, you've succeeded. I'll be completely devoted to you from now on. Xiaocheng, just say something!" [[18989 苏桃 sad]]
The last sentence from Su Tao was almost a shout. [[18990 苏桃 sad]]
She couldn't accept this turn of events. [[18991 旁白 neutral]]
She had woken up, and she had confessed. After overcoming life and death, they should be holding each other close. [[18992 旁白 neutral]]
So why hate me at a time like this? [[18993 苏桃 sad]]
Didn't you call me Tao Tao just before? [[18994 苏桃 sad]]
She moved closer to the bed, and Chi Xiaocheng shrank back into a corner, looking frightened. Her eyes were filled with a mix of emotions. [[18995 旁白 neutral]]
Refusal, fear, shock, helplessness, and confusion. [[18996 旁白 neutral]]
Like a little lamb cornered by a big bad wolf. [[18997 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao reached out to grab Chi Xiaocheng's hand, but before she could, a sharp voice called out from the doorway, "Miss Su!" [[18998 苏教授 angry]]
Her body froze. Su Tao quickly came to her senses and turned to see Professor Su at the door. [[18999 旁白 neutral]]
Her chapped lips trembled, but she couldn't say a word. [[19000 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su glanced at Chi Xiaocheng, then said to Su Tao, "You, come with me first." [[19001 苏教授 neutral]]
Su Tao said anxiously, "But Professor, Xiaocheng, she..." [[19002 苏桃 sad]]
"That's enough, come with me now!" [[19003 苏教授 angry]]
Professor Su's commanding tone silenced Su Tao. [[19004 旁白 neutral]]
The young woman glanced at Chi Xiaocheng with a final trace of hope in her eyes, but the girl still had a look of refusal, though it wasn't quite disgust. [[19005 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao turned away, dejected, and walked toward the door. [[19006 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind was still a complete mess. [[19007 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't understand why this was happening. Xiaocheng's reaction after waking up was unlike any of the countless scenarios she had imagined. [[19008 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the room, Professor Su glanced at her and said calmly, "Compose yourself and come with me. I'll tell you about Miss Chi's condition." [[19009 苏教授 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao's eyes suddenly lit up. [[19010 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly followed Professor Su. Before they even reached the office, she asked impatiently, "Professor Su, what's wrong with Xiaocheng? She... she used to like me so much, but when we were just talking, she... she..." [[19011 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao bit her lip and forced herself to say the words she didn't want to admit, "She clearly said she hates me and has never liked me!" [[19012 苏桃 sad]]
Professor Su knew about her "romance" with Chi Xiaocheng; only that fool Dongfang Yang was in the dark. [[19013 旁白 neutral]]
Because she was so anxious, Su Tao didn't try to hide anything. [[19014 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su said, "Don't worry. I can't be sure about her condition right now. In fact, she only woke up an hour before you arrived. We've been running tests and haven't had time to determine her exact situation yet." [[19015 苏教授 neutral]]
"Then you showed up. I was about to stop you to give you a heads-up. It seems this is more serious than I thought." [[19016 苏教授 neutral]]
Professor Su's words made Su Tao pause for a moment. [[19017 旁白 neutral]]
She then took a deep breath. "Professor Su, are you saying that even though Xiaocheng is awake, she has other medical issues?" [[19018 苏桃 sad]]
"Let's go into the office first." [[19019 苏教授 neutral]]
They went into the office together. After pouring a glass of water for Su Tao, Professor Su said, "Sit here for a moment. I'm going to get the preliminary analysis report, and then I'll explain everything to you." [[19020 苏教授 neutral]]
"O... okay." [[19021 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao took a long, deep breath and slapped her cheeks with both hands, forcing herself to calm down. [[19022 旁白 neutral]]
Her once youthful and pretty face now looked a little haggard after the recent emotional rollercoaster. [[19023 旁白 neutral]]
Even if her body was fine, a person's spirit clearly affects their physical appearance. [[19024 旁白 neutral]]
Time passed slowly, almost like torture. [[19025 旁白 neutral]]
After a short while, the office door was pushed open. [[19026 旁白 neutral]]
