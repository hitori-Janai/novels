Chapter 29: Why Don't You Act Cute With Me? [[2474 旁白 neutral]]
    Back in the hospital room, both of them silently agreed not to mention what just happened. [[2475 旁白 neutral]]
    But there was one thing Chi Xiaocheng couldn't avoid. [[2476 旁白 neutral]]
    That was the huge medical bill! [[2477 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng looked at the medical bill in her hand, feeling her head buzzing. She looked at Dongfang Yang in confusion, "Twenty-three thousand? Why is it so expensive?" [[2478 池小橙 sad]]
    Dongfang Yang said calmly, "Look at what kind of room you're staying in and what kind of service you're getting. The doctors and nurses are on standby 24 hours a day for you. Not only did they use a lot of equipment, but the medicine was also top quality. Twenty-three thousand is actually reasonable." [[2479 东方阳 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng's hand holding the medical bill trembled slightly. This time she wasn't acting - she was really about to cry. "But... that's way too much!" [[2480 池小橙 sad]]
    "That doesn't even include your phone." Dongfang Yang pointed to the new phone in her hand and said calmly, "I had someone buy it for you last night. It's a Xiaomi 14, four thousand yuan. I'll round it down - just pay me back twenty-five thousand." [[2481 东方阳 neutral]]
    Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao with tearful eyes, "Taotao~" [[2482 池小橙 sad]]
    Her voice was soft and sweet as she acted cute, holding Su Tao's hand. Dongfang Yang was stunned. [[2483 旁白 neutral]]
    This sweet, soft loli voice - what man could resist it! [[2484 旁白 neutral]]
    His bad impression of Chi Xiaocheng plus Su Tao being nearby always made Dongfang Yang unconsciously ignore one fact. [[2485 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng was a legal loli whose looks were just as good as Su Tao's. [[2486 旁白 neutral]]
    Both were beautiful girls who would stand out even among the many noble ladies he knew. [[2487 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao stood to the side, awkwardly twirling her hair. Her pretty profile faced Dongfang Yang, and in her eyes, seeing two girls so close together was quite enjoyable. [[2488 苏桃 neutral]]
    She felt like it wouldn't be a loss if she could take either of their places. [[2489 苏桃 neutral]]
    Su Tao cleared her throat softly, "Sorry, Xiaocheng, I don't have much money either. My part-time job wages for this month haven't been paid yet, and I only have two thousand yuan on me. Um... I'll give you fifteen hundred." [[2490 苏桃 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng was really happy that Su Tao could lend her fifteen hundred when she only had two thousand. [[2491 旁白 neutral]]
    But compared to the huge gap of twenty-five thousand, it really wasn't enough. [[2492 旁白 neutral]]
    She leaned against the headboard feeling defeated, thinking about how to use her advantage as a transmigrator to make some quick money. [[2493 池小橙 neutral]]
    Right now, she only had four hundred yuan on her. [[2494 池小橙 neutral]]
    Throwing away her phone had been too impulsive! [[2495 池小橙 neutral]]
    In her previous life, Chi Xiaocheng had just graduated from university and studied new media for a few years. Apart from tuition paid by her family, she earned her living expenses by writing novels. [[2496 旁白 neutral]]
    However, even though she had been writing for years, she was always a failed author, earning only a thousand yuan per month including perfect attendance bonuses, just enough to get by. [[2497 旁白 neutral]]
    After transmigrating to this parallel world, Chi Xiaocheng had done some research. This place was called the Great Zhou Kingdom. Although the system and core were similar to her previous world's China, this novel was a female-oriented story, so the world setting served the various powerful male leads. [[2498 旁白 neutral]]
    Financial groups were everywhere, powerful families were extremely strong, and the entertainment industry was highly developed. Methods like copying novels, anime, and movies that transmigrators usually used to make money were completely unavailable to her. [[2499 旁白 neutral]]
    In such a setting, while there weren't any ridiculous urban supernatural powers, the novel's setting did include the existence of ancient martial artists in the Great Zhou Kingdom. [[2500 旁白 neutral]]
    The priority was self-protection first, then thinking about paying him back. Dongfang Yang was so rich, maybe if she owed him for ten or eight years, he'd forget about it? [[2501 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng looked at him, and he happened to look back. Their eyes met. [[2502 旁白 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang smiled teasingly, "If you act cute with me like you just did with Su Tao, I might be happy enough to forgive you a bit more." [[2503 东方阳 neutral]]
    He showed a confident expression. [[2504 旁白 neutral]]
    He thought to himself that if she called him "big brother" in that same soft, sweet voice, he wouldn't mind forgiving her two thousand yuan. [[2505 东方阳 neutral]]
    But who knew, as soon as he said it, Chi Xiaocheng's expectant little eyes became disgusted. [[2506 旁白 neutral]]
    She turned her head away, pouting, "No way." [[2507 池小橙 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang's mouth twitched, "You confessed to me before, and now you're so disgusted by me?" [[2508 东方阳 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng huffed softly, "I only act cute with Taotao." [[2509 池小橙 neutral]]
    Su Tao watched Chi Xiaocheng's complete rejection and realized that her previous confession to Dongfang Yang might have had the same motive as Ye Liang's - she didn't want her and Dongfang Yang to be together. [[2510 苏桃 neutral]]
    The love she spoke of was something she put into action every moment. [[2511 苏桃 neutral]]
    Feeling warm in her heart, Su Tao looked at Dongfang Yang, "How about this - I'll also take responsibility for part of the money Xiaocheng owes. You're not short of money, so you're not in a hurry, right? We'll slowly pay you back within a year." [[2512 苏桃 neutral]]
    Seeing Su Tao speak up for Chi Xiaocheng again, Dongfang Yang really felt like she was being stolen away. [[2513 旁白 neutral]]
    Just a few days ago, she was quite clingy with him. [[2514 旁白 neutral]]
    Now everything was about Xiaocheng. [[2515 旁白 neutral]]
    He scratched his hair and sighed, "Forget it. I invested in a coffee shop outside the school. Chi Xiaocheng, you can work there for three months, and I'll consider the debt forgiven." [[2516 东方阳 neutral]]
    "Really?" Chi Xiaocheng's eyes sparkled. [[2517 池小橙 happy]]
    "It's just a casual task for the family anyway. Just don't mess it up." [[2518 东方阳 neutral]]
    "Thank you, Young Master Dongfang!" Chi Xiaocheng gave him a happy smile, her small pointed canine tooth looking extremely cute. [[2519 池小橙 happy]]
    Dongfang Yang nodded coolly, "Only because of Su Tao. Also, for these three months, you're my subordinate. Don't be timid. If anyone dares to bully you, fight back, understand?" [[2520 东方阳 neutral]]
    "Yes, yes!" [[2521 池小橙 happy]]
    Dongfang Yang's lips curved up, "Come on, call me boss." [[2522 东方阳 neutral]]
    "Boss Dongfang~" [[2523 池小橙 happy]]
    Chi Xiaocheng called out sweetly, her voice clear and intoxicating like a lark. [[2524 旁白 neutral]]
    This girl is actually quite cute. [[2525 东方阳 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang thought this as he looked at Chi Xiaocheng's pretty face for a while, then looked away somewhat awkwardly. [[2526 旁白 neutral]]
    After chatting for a long time, the doctor came for Chi Xiaocheng's second checkup, and then Su Tao and Dongfang Yang left the room together. [[2527 旁白 neutral]]
    "Thank you, Dongfang Yang." Su Tao came to the hallway, looked back at the door, and spoke sincerely. [[2528 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dongfang Yang nodded lightly, "I'm just afraid she'll have an accident. With my reputation, Ye Liang probably won't openly target her." [[2529 东方阳 neutral]]
    Su Tao was stunned, "So you had that plan too?" [[2530 苏桃 neutral]]
    "What else?" Dongfang Yang shrugged, "Making her pay back the money was just teasing her. Twenty thousand yuan isn't even enough for a proper meal for me. Looking at the cheap cosmetics she used to use, I know she doesn't have much money." [[2531 东方阳 neutral]]
    Su Tao scratched her cheek, "I was worried you'd dislike her." [[2532 苏桃 neutral]]
    "I did a bit before." Dongfang Yang put his hands in his pockets, then remembered that sweet call of "boss" and smiled. [[2533 东方阳 neutral]]
    "But now, I think she's not bad." [[2534 东方阳 neutral]]
    Although it was an accident, the result was good. [[2535 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng also knew in her heart that after learning about her being bullied, Dongfang Yang had the idea of protecting her. [[2536 池小橙 neutral]]
    This young master seems a bit tsundere. [[2537 池小橙 neutral]]
    Time flew by, and after resting for three days, Chi Xiaocheng went through the discharge procedures. [[2538 旁白 neutral]]
    During this time, Su Tao stayed by her side almost constantly, even feeding her meals on the first day. [[2539 旁白 neutral]]
    Although she was still a girl, she already showed a hint of that mature wife-like charm. [[2540 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng both enjoyed it and loved it. [[2541 池小橙 happy]]
    Nothing unexpected happened during this time, and she behaved extra well. [[2542 池小橙 neutral]]
    This made Su Tao even more convinced that yandere could be cured! [[2543 苏桃 neutral]]
