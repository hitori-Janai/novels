Chapter 27: She's Quite Cute [[2306 旁白 neutral]]
"This..." [[2307 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao was suddenly at a loss for words and quickly started brainstorming. [[2308 旁白 neutral]]
If it were an ordinary person asking, they might mean whether her figure was cute or something like that. [[2309 旁白 neutral]]
But since it was Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao felt she couldn't answer directly. [[2310 旁白 neutral]]
Because Chi Xiaocheng was a yandere! [[2311 旁白 neutral]]
She had self-harm tendencies and thought differently from others. [[2312 旁白 neutral]]
Recalling what she knew about yanderes, Su Tao felt that neither of her two options was very good. [[2313 旁白 neutral]]
A: Don't like it. [[2314 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng might think I don't like her, which could make her condition worse. She might fall into that strange state, or she might turn dark, or even have a breakdown! [[2315 苏桃 neutral]]
B: Like it. [[2316 旁白 neutral]]
This was indeed a problem-free option. The only issue was that her goal was to make Xiaocheng stop being a yandere. Just pretending to like her would be fine, but if she said it directly, would it deepen the misunderstanding? [[2317 苏桃 neutral]]
After thinking briefly, Su Tao knew this was an easy question with only one answer. [[2318 旁白 neutral]]
She answered awkwardly, "I like it." [[2319 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked again, her tone innocent, "Then what do you like most?" [[2320 池小橙 neutral]]
"Uh... hands, I guess." [[2321 苏桃 neutral]]
Her eyes looked guilty, but fortunately she was behind Chi Xiaocheng fixing her hair, so her guilt wouldn't be noticed. [[2322 旁白 neutral]]
But answering like this should help her avoid the topic, right? [[2323 苏桃 neutral]]
She thought so. [[2324 旁白 neutral]]
But then she heard Chi Xiaocheng say quietly, "Since Taotao likes them, how about I give you my hands?" [[2325 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao paused her movements, "Give... give?" [[2326 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded gently, "Yes, does Taotao want the left hand or the right hand? I'll cut it off and give it to you." [[2327 池小橙 neutral]]
Suddenly, Su Tao's guilty expression turned to panic. She quickly came to Chi Xiaocheng's front, with a forced smile and as gentle a tone as possible, "You don't need to... give them to me. What I like more is a healthy, complete Xiaocheng." [[2328 苏桃 neutral]]
"Oh, I see..." [[2329 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yes, yes, that's right!" [[2330 苏桃 happy]]
"Okay, then I'll eat more meat and take good care of my body." [[2331 池小橙 happy]]
A sweet smile bloomed on her face, extremely cute. [[2332 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment. [[2333 旁白 neutral]]
Then she felt overjoyed. [[2334 苏桃 happy]]
She seemed to have found a way to treat Chi Xiaocheng! [[2335 苏桃 happy]]
Because I said I liked hands, she thought she had to cut off her hands to make me happy. [[2336 苏桃 neutral]]
Now I said I wanted her to be healthy. [[2337 苏桃 neutral]]
She would really try to eat more and recover her body. [[2338 苏桃 neutral]]
So this is how yanderes work! [[2339 苏桃 neutral]]
As long as I keep an eye on her, it shouldn't be a problem? [[2340 苏桃 neutral]]
Looking at Chi Xiaocheng squinting and smiling foolishly, with a small pointed canine tooth showing, Su Tao also showed a relaxed smile. [[2341 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, normal Xiaocheng was still very cute. [[2342 苏桃 happy]]
She chose to ignore the issue about hands, and the atmosphere between them became harmonious as they finally started having a normal conversation. [[2343 旁白 neutral]]
After last night's rain, the morning outside gradually brightened, and a ray of sunlight fell from the window, landing right on Su Tao. [[2344 旁白 neutral]]
She wore a hospital gown, smiled as she talked, her slender fingers swaying gently, as if painting the scenes she described for Chi Xiaocheng. [[2345 旁白 neutral]]
The sunlight dyed her black hair with a golden glow, half her face serene and gentle, making Chi Xiaocheng's heart skip a beat. [[2346 旁白 neutral]]
"So beautiful." [[2347 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao, who was talking about school topics, was stunned by Chi Xiaocheng's words, "What?" [[2348 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng showed her dimples, saying softly, "I said, I like you!" [[2349 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao was dazed and couldn't help but turn her head away. [[2350 苏桃 neutral]]
"Really, saying such things again." [[2351 苏桃 neutral]]
A blush appeared on her delicate face, perfectly hidden by the sunlight, making Chi Xiaocheng feel she looked even more beautiful. [[2352 旁白 neutral]]
However, this warm and intimate atmosphere didn't last long. [[2353 旁白 neutral]]
There was a knock outside, and Dongfang Yang walked in with a doctor. [[2354 旁白 neutral]]
The doctor looked at Chi Xiaocheng and said, "Have you contacted the patient's family? We need a family member to sign here." [[2355 旁白 neutral]]
"Uh..." [[2356 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao and Dongfang Yang both looked at Chi Xiaocheng. [[2357 旁白 neutral]]
The signature should have been done yesterday, but because of the emergency and Dongfang Yang's guarantee as a young master, it had been delayed until now. [[2358 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao said, "I originally wanted to contact Brother Chi Song, but I thought it would be better not to worry them about this kind of thing, so I've been planning to wait until you woke up to see." [[2359 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng hesitated for a moment and asked, "Can't I sign it myself?" [[2360 池小橙 neutral]]
From her memories, she knew the original owner's family was ordinary, with parents who had been farmers for generations, living in a not-so-wealthy village far from Jiuzhou City, unable to come over. [[2361 旁白 neutral]]
As a villainous supporting character, she also had an equally villainous brother. [[2362 旁白 neutral]]
Three years ago, when the brother learned from her school teacher that Chi Xiaocheng had good grades in her first year of high school and might get into a top university with two years of effort, he chose to drop out of college and join society. [[2363 旁白 neutral]]
Because he had no skills and was naive, he was deceived and ended up following a gang boss. [[2364 旁白 neutral]]
Over two years, he didn't achieve much and was even arrested several times, but he kept sending tuition and living expenses back home. [[2365 旁白 neutral]]
Until a year ago, when he took a knife for the gang boss, he lost an arm but also became the boss's trusted aide, earning a commercial apartment in the inner ring of Jiuzhou City. [[2366 旁白 neutral]]
This was exactly where Chi Xiaocheng now lived. [[2367 旁白 neutral]]
In the original story, after the original owner was killed by Ye Liang, her brother appeared as a new villain who turned dark, leading the boss's forces in a mad pursuit of Ye Liang, living for about two hundred chapters before meeting a tragic end. [[2368 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng knew that when it came to family, whether he had turned dark or not, her brother was always very good. [[2369 旁白 neutral]]
Although she had transmigrated, she still respected this bond, and unless absolutely necessary, Chi Xiaocheng didn't want to worry the original owner's brother. [[2370 旁白 neutral]]
The main concern was that he might conflict with the male leads, which would be really troublesome. [[2371 旁白 neutral]]
Because of this, when she looked at the doctor, her little eyes practically screamed "I have unspeakable difficulties." [[2372 旁白 neutral]]
The doctor looked at Dongfang Yang expressionlessly. [[2373 旁白 neutral]]
The latter said calmly, "It's nothing serious anyway, just let her sign it herself. It's just a formality." [[2374 东方阳 neutral]]
"Alright." [[2375 旁白 neutral]]
The doctor nodded without saying much. [[2376 旁白 neutral]]
After handing Chi Xiaocheng the medical instructions to sign, he left on his own. [[2377 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Dongfang Yang weakly, using her acting skills to instantly become a bit more cute and fragile. [[2378 旁白 neutral]]
However, with Su Tao present, she didn't go too far. [[2379 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you, Young Master Dongfang." [[2380 池小橙 neutral]]
She said weakly, which in Su Tao's eyes just looked like fear. [[2381 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't help but turn around and defend her, saying, "Dongfang Yang, don't scare Xiaocheng." [[2382 苏桃 neutral]]
"Huh?" Dongfang Yang pointed at himself, "How did I scare her?" [[2383 东方阳 neutral]]
He had only said one sentence since entering the room! [[2384 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Your expression scared her. Just be normal like usual. You're not good at acting cool." [[2385 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang: "..." [[2386 东方阳 neutral]]
He felt wronged. [[2387 旁白 neutral]]
He had clearly stayed quiet so as not to disturb the doctor! [[2388 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao grabbed one of Chi Xiaocheng's small hands and gently squeezed it, "It's okay, Xiaocheng. He won't scare you like before." [[2389 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded gently, then looked at Dongfang Yang, "I'm... I'm sorry." [[2390 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang waved his hand generously, "Forget it, it's nothing anyway." [[2391 东方阳 neutral]]
"No, no." Chi Xiaocheng quickly shook her head to explain, "What I mean is, when you came in just now, even though I knew you wouldn't do anything to me, I was still a little scared." [[2392 池小橙 neutral]]
"I have to apologize for this. You've helped me so much, yet I still thought this way." [[2393 池小橙 neutral]]
She lowered her head, her tea-colored hair perfectly catching the sunlight, creating a thin golden mist. Her frail appearance made people feel much more fond of her. [[2394 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang touched his cheek, feeling a bit embarrassed. [[2395 旁白 neutral]]
This was her reason for apologizing. [[2396 旁白 neutral]]
And was she blushing when she lowered her head? [[2397 旁白 neutral]]
She felt... quite cute. [[2398 东方阳 neutral]]
