Chapter 164: Confronting Ye Liang! [[14375 旁白 neutral]]
Three days passed in the blink of an eye. [[14376 旁白 neutral]]
Trapped in a cycle of internal conflict, Su Tao finally shifted her focus from self-blame with the return of Chi Song. [[14377 旁白 neutral]]
She felt too ashamed to face Chi Song, and perhaps he knew that seeing her would cause her stress, so he chose not to come home to meet her. [[14378 旁白 neutral]]
But his return did indeed help Su Tao shift her focus from her inner turmoil to hatred. [[14379 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang! [[14380 苏桃 angry]]
If it weren't for him, Xiaocheng wouldn't have been in trouble, wouldn't have argued with me, and might not have even turned into a yandere! [[14381 苏桃 angry]]
If I can't avenge Xiaocheng, then when I die, or when she comes to me in my dreams, how could I ever face her? [[14382 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang must die! [[14383 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao was alone, and Ye Liang was watching her. Neither Dongfang Yang nor Si Chen wanted her to take any risks. [[14384 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao herself didn't think so. [[14385 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, her eyes flashed with determination. "Xiaocheng died because of me. If I have to rely on you for everything, even for avenging her, then what's the point of me staying alive!" [[14386 苏桃 angry]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng's death, she didn't understand this. [[14387 旁白 neutral]]
She thought it was enough that she was there. She had other friends and a lot of work, not to mention her mentor who was in the hospital. [[14388 旁白 neutral]]
There were casual classmates, the student council, university clubs, and some teachers who had her contact info and occasionally asked for help. [[14389 旁白 neutral]]
These were all complicated relationships in her life, and she believed her life was quite full. [[14390 旁白 neutral]]
She was busy every day, so it didn't feel empty. [[14391 旁白 neutral]]
When she was always busy and still had to look after this cute little girl, Su Tao felt a mix of fondness and frustration, sometimes wondering if she'd have more time for other things if Xiaocheng weren't such a burden. [[14392 旁白 neutral]]
And now, Chi Xiaocheng was dead. [[14393 旁白 sad]]
She finally understood that those so-called complicated relationships in her life wouldn't change much if she were gone. [[14394 旁白 sad]]
And if she lost those relationships, her life wouldn't change much either. [[14395 旁白 sad]]
But without Chi Xiaocheng, she felt like a piece of her heart was missing. [[14396 旁白 sad]]
Work is busy, studying is tiring, and relationships are frustrating, but after all of it, you're the first person I think of. [[14397 苏桃 sad]]
Only after losing you did I realize that the motivation to do all those things was because I could see you after they were done! [[14398 苏桃 sad]]
Her determination finally made Dongfang Yang and Si Chen give in. [[14399 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at this moon-like girl, after two months, Dongfang Yang finally saw a glimpse of the person she was when they first met. [[14400 旁白 neutral]]
However, she had changed back only because someone important had left her. [[14401 旁白 sad]]
The plan against Ye Liang began. [[14402 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang tied up some of the Ye family's forces in the capital, making it impossible for them to support Ye Liang in Jiuzhou City. [[14403 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen acted as an intelligence hub, gathering all sorts of information on Ye Liang and handling the officials in Jiuzhou City. [[14404 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song and Long Ge frantically targeted Ye Liang's underground businesses. During this time, incidents like accidental fires and gas explosions frequently occurred in Jiuzhou City. [[14405 旁白 neutral]]
It caused widespread panic. [[14406 旁白 neutral]]
But they also made significant progress. Ye Liang had tried to bring people back from Lizhi City, but Long Ge's group intercepted them and got information about many of Ye Liang's businesses in Jiuzhou City. [[14407 旁白 neutral]]
With attacks from multiple fronts, even though Jiuzhou City was Ye Liang's home base, he couldn't react in time. [[14408 旁白 neutral]]
He even gave up on the hospital where he was receiving treatment. [[14409 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao, during the time she was on good terms with Ye Liang, had met many of his old acquaintances. [[14410 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to win them over, or at least use them to guess Ye Liang's location. [[14411 旁白 neutral]]
But taking a chance came with risks. [[14412 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone knew that. [[14413 旁白 neutral]]
Including Su Tao. [[14414 旁白 neutral]]
She was walking on a busy street when a girl suddenly bumped into her. [[14415 旁白 neutral]]
The deliberate bump was too obvious. Before Su Tao could even get angry, a note was slipped into her hand. [[14416 旁白 neutral]]
With a suspicious look, she went into the women's restroom to read it. [[14417 旁白 neutral]]
"This is Ye Liang. I know you're looking for me. Believe it or not, Lin Fangya did this behind my back." [[14418 叶良 neutral]]
"I just woke up in the hospital and found out that Lin Fangya targeted you without my knowledge. But you're taking your anger out on me and messing up my city." [[14419 叶良 neutral]]
"This is my home base, so I'll be the one losing in the end. I don't want to be your enemy. I'm willing to talk and hand over Lin Fangya." [[14420 叶良 neutral]]
"Also, I've already caught and interrogated Xiao Ming. I have news about your father. I also have some of Chi Xiaocheng's belongings. But since you keep targeting me, I've protected Chi Xiaocheng's parents to prevent you from doing anything desperate." [[14421 叶良 neutral]]
"Si Chen and Dongfang Yang are after my assets, so they won't believe me. But you're different, Su Tao. If you trust me, come alone to the Jujuyouni Hotel the day after tomorrow at 8 PM. I'll explain everything to you in person." [[14422 叶良 neutral]]
"--Ye Liang." [[14423 叶良 neutral]]
The note was written on both sides. Su Tao had seen Ye Liang's handwriting before and confirmed it was his. [[14424 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[14425 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's expression turned strange. [[14426 旁白 neutral]]
Did Ye Liang really think she was a fool, or that she would be blinded by hatred? [[14427 旁白 neutral]]
However... [[14428 旁白 neutral]]
This was exactly what she wanted! [[14429 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao clenched the note, her eyes turning ice-cold. [[14430 苏桃 angry]]
... [[14431 旁白 neutral]]
Three days passed quickly. Su Tao took care of her health, changed into a thick, black down coat, and walked into the kitchen. [[14432 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze lingered on the kitchen knife for a few seconds. [[14433 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, she put the fruit knife that Chi Xiaocheng often used into her pocket. [[14434 旁白 neutral]]
She stepped out, hailed a taxi, and said flatly, "Driver, to the Jujuyouni Hotel." [[14435 苏桃 neutral]]
"Miss Su Tao, it seems you're really following the instructions on the note." [[14436 陌生男1 neutral]]
The driver grinned, his eyes in the rearview mirror growing playful. [[14437 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao adjusted the collar of her coat and said lightly, "What, are you afraid I'll tell Dongfang Yang and the others, so you're planning to change the location? I don't mind. You've been watching me outside my apartment for three days, right?" [[14438 苏桃 neutral]]
"That's right." [[14439 陌生男1 neutral]]
The driver started the taxi. "For the past three days, we've had hackers monitoring not just the inside and outside of your apartment complex, but also your phone." [[14440 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Originally, we had another place in mind. But you've been very obedient these three days and haven't told anyone about your agreement with the young master, so there's no need to change the location." [[14441 陌生男1 neutral]]
The driver seemed to be mocking Su Tao's naivety, leaning back in his seat and letting his guard down. [[14442 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't notice the very strange look in Su Tao's eyes. [[14443 旁白 neutral]]
She really wanted to ask, are your hackers actually reliable? [[14444 苏桃 neutral]]
The taxi moved slowly. Su Tao even felt the driver take several detours, seemingly to confirm no one was following, before finally arriving at the Jujuyouni Hotel. [[14445 旁白 neutral]]
Before getting out, Su Tao saw a man with a strange posture, standing awkwardly by the entrance and looking at her. [[14446 旁白 neutral]]
His nasty smile made Su Tao instantly clench the fruit knife in her pocket. [[14447 旁白 angry]]
Ye Liang, today you will die! [[14448 苏桃 angry]]
