Chapter 245: The Distance Between the Stars and the Moon [[20948 旁白 neutral]]
"Tang Tang, seriously, why are you so excited about me and Xiaocheng!" [[20949 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the messages from her friend, which kept asking when she would arrive. She sighed and replied. [[20950 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since she made it clear last time that the person she liked was actually Xiaocheng. [[20951 旁白 neutral]]
This friend's personality seemed to have changed. She used to be somewhat serious, but now she had become very enthusiastic. [[20952 旁白 neutral]]
Tang Tang replied, "Of course I'm excited. I'm just so curious about your story—growing up together, overcoming all sorts of difficulties, and your sisterly bond turning into love." [[20953 唐糖 happy]]
"You're too shy to talk about it when I ask, so there should be no problem with me wanting to get to know little Xiaocheng, right?" [[20954 唐糖 happy]]
"By the way, what style of formal dresses are you wearing today? Is it a matching set for couples?" [[20955 唐糖 happy]]
"Also, I haven't seen little Xiaocheng for many years. Back in middle school, I only saw her occasionally hiding behind you, so I don't remember her very well. Is she even cuter than before?" [[20956 唐糖 happy]]
For every sentence Su Tao said, she would reply with many more. [[20957 旁白 neutral]]
The young woman covered her face, "Xiaocheng and I aren't even officially together yet. She... she had a small problem after waking up from the hospital. Anyway, it's not happening as fast as you think." [[20958 苏桃 sad]]
Tang Tang: "Oh, I can't help being excited! In our circle, there are quite a few girl couples, but they're mostly just looking for some fun. A pure love like yours is something new to me!" [[20959 唐糖 happy]]
Su Tao: "What on earth do you mean, 'new'!" [[20960 苏桃 angry]]
However, Su Tao caught on to the important words in Tang Tang's message. [[20961 旁白 neutral]]
In her circle, couples like her and Xiaocheng were not uncommon. [[20962 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen had also said before that the upper-class circles were actually quite messy, and her concerns about gender were just personal limitations. For them, it was completely normal. [[20963 旁白 neutral]]
The doubt that had always been in her heart prompted Su Tao to send a message to Tang Tang, "Are couples like me and Xiaocheng really that common?" [[20964 苏桃 neutral]]
Tang Tang: "Hmm? You mean two girls being together?" [[20965 唐糖 neutral]]
Tang Tang: "At least in my circle, it's quite common. Some rich young ladies who don't want to get married will find someone of the same gender to refuse the pursuits of young masters. Some are just pretending, but most are real." [[20966 唐糖 neutral]]
Tang Tang: "It's also quite common in regular society. I don't think it's strange. It's just that it's rare in your environment. I remember your family is from the countryside, right?" [[20967 唐糖 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Yes." [[20968 苏桃 neutral]]
Tang Tang: "Well, there you go. The people there are not very open-minded and have deep-rooted ideas about getting married and having children. Here in the big city, you see it everywhere." [[20969 唐糖 neutral]]
Could it be that she was really overthinking things? [[20970 旁白 neutral]]
Tang Tang: "If you ask me, Taozi, you're just too straight. Otherwise, you definitely wouldn't think so much about it." [[20971 唐糖 neutral]]
Su Tao pouted, "My emotional intelligence isn't low." [[20972 苏桃 neutral]]
Tang Tang: "Socializing and romance require different kinds of emotional intelligence." [[20973 唐糖 neutral]]
Just as she was about to say more, she suddenly felt the car stop, and Dongfang Yang's voice reached her ears, "We're here." [[20974 东方阳 neutral]]
This was Si Chen's family branch in Jiuzhou City, and also the location for tonight's banquet. [[20975 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to last time, Su Tao's outfit was much more reserved. [[20976 旁白 neutral]]
She wore a gray-black down coat over a pure white knit sweater, with a few blue accessories inside and out. The pure white fur collar on the hood was the most eye-catching part of the outfit. [[20977 旁白 neutral]]
The sweater was slim-fitting, the cotton pants were snug, and she wore long boots. Since the coat was open, Su Tao's impressive figure, usually hidden under loose clothes, was somewhat noticeable. [[20978 旁白 neutral]]
Her soft, smooth hair was still tied up in a high ponytail. [[20979 旁白 neutral]]
With a blank expression, she looked cool and at the same time had a cold beauty that kept strangers away. [[20980 旁白 neutral]]
She was like a star, faintly shining, but not too obviously. [[20981 旁白 neutral]]
"If she's attending a banquet, Xiaocheng might change into a formal dress?" [[20982 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao got out of the car and looked at Dongfang Yang to ask. [[20983 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang nodded, "Yes, I heard Si Chen prepared a dress for her. But with her small and short figure, it won't make much difference. Standing next to me, people might think she's my daughter." [[20984 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao pouted, a little displeased with Dongfang Yang's words. [[20985 苏桃 angry]]
What did he mean by small and short. [[20986 旁白 angry]]
That's petite! [[20987 旁白 angry]]
Si Chen was right that Dongfang Yang was a bit dense. He had no idea how comfortable it was to hold Xiaocheng in her arms! [[20988 旁白 angry]]
"Let's go, let's go inside first. If others arrive later, they'll probably hold me up with conversation." [[20989 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang didn't look back and led Su Tao forward. [[20990 旁白 neutral]]
The scale of this banquet was small. All the guests were from the younger generation of various families. Compared to Si Zhenliu's birthday banquet last time, it was not as luxurious, but there were clearly more things for young people to do. [[20991 旁白 neutral]]
In the center of the main hall, there was also a large stage. [[20992 旁白 neutral]]
While she was still observing the layout of the venue, Su Tao heard Si Chen's voice, "Su Tao, this outfit is quite nice. It feels much better than your last formal dress. You always looked too delicate in a dress, which was less stunning." [[20993 司辰 neutral]]
As soon as Su Tao turned around, she heard Si Chen add, "But for today, you're still a bit lacking compared to Chi Xiaocheng." [[20994 司辰 neutral]]
She glanced to the side and was captivated. [[20995 旁白 neutral]]
The familiar girl stood beside Si Chen like a princess. The pure white long dress was expertly tailored, outlining her slender figure. [[20996 旁白 neutral]]
The neckline was slightly open, the cuffs were tightened, and the waistline of the dress was cinched with a belt studded with small diamonds. The skirt was layered with multiple layers of light gauze, and a semi-transparent small train extended to her ankles. [[20997 旁白 neutral]]
On her soft, tea-colored long hair, there was a small, delicate ice crystal crown. [[20998 旁白 neutral]]
It was like seeing a little princess from a fairy tale. [[20999 旁白 happy]]
Before Su Tao could even recover, Chi Xiaocheng lifted her skirt in annoyance, "Si Chen, this dress is so troublesome. I feel like I'll fall if I take a bigger step." [[21000 池小橙 angry]]
Si Chen chuckled softly, "A lady can't take steps that are too big. You have to be elegant, you know? And if you fall, there's a risk of exposure. You'd better be careful." [[21001 司辰 neutral]]
"I'm wearing safety shorts underneath!" [[21002 池小橙 angry]]
Besides, this dress wasn't very revealing. [[21003 旁白 neutral]]
The layered gauze skirt crossed in front of her calves, covering most of her legs. Only her calves would become a bit eye-catching as she walked. [[21004 旁白 neutral]]
If she were to fall flat on her back, no dress could prevent exposure. [[21005 旁白 neutral]]
As Dongfang Yang and Su Tao approached, Chi Xiaocheng raised a slight smile and asked, "Dongfang Yang, do you think this outfit looks good on me?" [[21006 池小橙 happy]]
"Of course, my beautiful little princess." [[21007 东方阳 happy]]
Dongfang Yang, knowing his part, placed his hand flat on his chest and gave a very gentlemanly European knight's bow. [[21008 旁白 neutral]]
He might be a bit goofy, but on this formal occasion, this simple gesture made many young ladies from other families notice him. [[21009 旁白 neutral]]
All eyes were focused on Chi Xiaocheng. [[21010 旁白 neutral]]
If this entire banquet were the sky, then the other beautifully dressed girls were the stars. When the light shone on Chi Xiaocheng, she was the only moon in the entire sky. [[21011 旁白 neutral]]
Even the brightest star was not as dazzling as her. [[21012 旁白 neutral]]
What's more, the brightest star was now hidden in the dark clouds, standing in a place untouched by the light. [[21013 旁白 sad]]
Staring blankly as the moon shone brightly. [[21014 旁白 sad]]
She wanted to reach out. [[21015 旁白 sad]]
But she found that every star was billions of light-years away from the moon. [[21016 旁白 sad]]
