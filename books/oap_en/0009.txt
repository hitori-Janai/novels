Chapter 9: Reaping Emotion Points! [[727 旁白 neutral]]
Sitting back in his chair, Dongfang Yang stared straight ahead, his index finger tapping rhythmically on the table in time with his shaking leg. [[728 旁白 neutral]]
The petite, pigtail-wearing girl before him kept her eyes downcast, her hands nervously clutching a corner of her skirt. [[729 旁白 neutral]]
Reason told him that Chi Xiaocheng was faking it. [[730 旁白 neutral]]
And it was an obvious act! [[731 旁白 neutral]]
But his experience told him that acting couldn't be this convincing. He had only seen such a drastic change in personality from veteran actors in the entertainment industry. [[732 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, her cute, slightly weary face made it hard to think ill of her. [[733 旁白 neutral]]
Could she really be a different person without makeup? [[734 东方阳 neutral]]
Why hadn't he noticed before that she was actually quite nice when she behaved? [[735 东方阳 neutral]]
Without even realizing it himself, his dislike for Chi Xiaocheng had faded significantly in that moment. [[736 旁白 neutral]]
He pointed to the seat opposite him and said in a deep voice, "Sit." [[737 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded timidly, smoothed her skirt, and moved to the seat. [[738 旁白 neutral]]
Her persona for the day was a timid, shy, and cute girl. [[739 旁白 neutral]]
The makeup was just a form of self-protection. [[740 旁白 neutral]]
The increase of Emotion Points in her mind hadn't stopped. Although it was only two or three points at a time, not as much as before, Chi Xiaocheng knew. [[741 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was being influenced by her. [[742 旁白 neutral]]
She acted like a flustered little rabbit, fidgeting restlessly. After a moment, she decided to speak first, lowering her head to Dongfang Yang. "Young Master Dongfang, please... please scold me!" [[743 池小橙 sad]]
Dongfang Yang laughed with amusement, resting his chin on one hand as he looked at Chi Xiaocheng. "Why should I scold you?" [[744 东方阳 neutral]]
"Because... because I kept bothering you before and caused you trouble. I came to apologize, so you can scold me however you want!" [[745 池小橙 sad]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow. "Really? Anything?" [[746 东方陽 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lifted one eye to glance at him worriedly. "It... it would be nice if you could be a little gentle." [[747 池小橙 neutral]]
Heh, an interesting woman. [[748 东方阳 neutral]]
Honestly, Dongfang Yang couldn't tell if Chi Xiaocheng was acting, but in his mind, the difference in her behavior was just too great. [[749 旁白 neutral]]
So he asked directly, "You said Su Tao talked some sense into you in the basement, and now you've changed your ways. I feel like you're a completely different person. Tell me, how did Su Tao persuade you?" [[750 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded timidly. "Actually, when I kidnapped Su Tao... well, I guess you could call it kidnapping. When I locked her in the basement, I mainly wanted to warn her to stay away from you." [[751 池小橙 neutral]]
"Young Master Dongfang, you know that Su Tao is very reasonable and gentle. Even when I threatened her, she didn't get angry. Instead, she told me that I was just being misled by Xiu Hua and the others." [[752 池小橙 neutral]]
"Xiu Hua?" Dongfang Yang interjected curiously. [[753 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng quickly passed the blame she had prepared. "She's a friend of mine. She taught me how to do my makeup and how to target Su Tao. She said that both you, Young Master Dongfang, and Young Master Ye Liang, originally liked me, but Su Tao stole you away." [[754 池小橙 neutral]]
"So... so..." [[755 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't continue, lowering her head in shame. [[756 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang picked up where she left off. "So you actually believed that?" [[757 东方阳 neutral]]
"Yes." Chi Xiaocheng quickly explained, "But in the basement, Su Tao explained everything to me bit by bit. She was like moonlight within reach, shining on me and driving away the darkness. I... I can't believe I did such horrible things to her before!" [[758 池小橙 sad]]
"I'm not a good person!" [[759 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked like she was about to slap herself. [[760 旁白 neutral]]
Then she went on and on, praising Su Tao. [[761 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang enjoyed listening to it. [[762 旁白 neutral]]
Because he also thought Su Tao was perfect, and Chi Xiaocheng's words were exactly what he felt. [[763 旁白 neutral]]
Once he felt that connection, he subconsciously believed the little lolita's words a bit more. [[764 旁白 neutral]]
But he still spoke with disdain, "You really are incredibly stupid." [[765 东方阳 angry]]
"S-sorry!" [[766 池小橙 sad]]
"Lift your head." [[767 东方阳 neutral]]
Hearing the commanding tone, Chi Xiaocheng raised her small head high, though her eyes darted around nervously. [[768 旁白 neutral]]
Her delicate little face was fully revealed to Dongfang Yang. [[769 旁白 neutral]]
Although this young master had seen countless beautiful women, he had to admit that the makeup-free Chi Xiaocheng was quite easy on the eyes. [[770 旁白 neutral]]
Still, she couldn't compare to Su Tao! [[771 旁白 neutral]]
He added this in his mind, then said to Chi Xiaocheng, "I'll believe you for now, but if I find out you're lying, you're dead!" [[772 东方阳 angry]]
"I... I won't!" Chi Xiaocheng appeared very flustered. "I know I'm not good enough for you, Young Master Dongfang. I won't bother you anymore!" [[773 池小橙 sad]]
"Good." [[774 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang nodded deeply. After asking for more details about what happened in the basement, he was ready to send Chi Xiaocheng away. [[775 旁白 neutral]]
But he saw the little lolita fidgeting as if she had something else to say. [[776 旁白 neutral]]
He asked, "Is there anything else?" [[777 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded lightly, took out her phone, and opened her social media feed. [[778 旁白 neutral]]
It was the post where she had shared her no-makeup photo. [[779 旁白 neutral]]
With a very serious expression, she said to Dongfang Yang, "Um, this photo, it's without any makeup!" [[780 池小橙 neutral]]
The corner of Dongfang Yang's mouth twitched. [[781 旁白 neutral]]
An hour ago, he had replied that if the photo wasn't edited, he would eat a... well, something unpleasant. [[782 旁白 neutral]]
Was she looking for trouble? [[783 东方阳 angry]]
Just as he was about to curse, Dongfang Yang noticed that his reply on the post was gone. [[784 旁白 neutral]]
Did she delete it first? [[785 旁白 neutral]]
That's pretty thoughtful. [[786 旁白 neutral]]
He rubbed his nose and didn't say anything more. [[787 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, after happily reaping the last wave of Emotion Points, hurriedly left the cafe. [[788 旁白 neutral]]
From start to finish, she maintained her cute persona. [[789 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until her small figure disappeared at the end of the road that Dongfang Yang snorted, "All an act." [[790 东方阳 neutral]]
He collected his thoughts and snapped his fingers. [[791 旁白 neutral]]
A man in black at another table stood up respectfully and asked, "Young Master, what are your orders?" [[792 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Investigate the relationship between Chi Xiaocheng and that Xiu Hua. You heard what she just said. See how much of it was a lie." [[793 东方阳 neutral]]
"Yes, Young Master." [[794 陌生男1 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng, completely unaware that her story would be investigated, walked out of the school gate with a happy expression. "System, how many Emotion Points did I get this time?" [[795 池小橙 happy]]
[During this time, Dongfang Yang provided the host with 214 Emotion Points] [[796 系统 neutral]]
[The female lead, Su Tao, provided the host with 32 Emotion Points] [[797 系统 neutral]]
[The host now has a total of 271 Emotion Points] [[798 系统 neutral]]
"Great! Purchase the content from chapters 140-160 of the novel!" [[799 池小橙 happy]]
These were the chapters where her character, the cannon fodder sidekick, was written out. But according to the usual tropes in novels, when one villain exits, another one is introduced. [[800 旁白 neutral]]
Conflict is what drives the most emotion in a story. [[801 旁白 neutral]]
These elements are needed to make the protagonist act, either willingly or unwillingly. [[802 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng needed a way to secretly get close to Su Tao to carry out her plan. [[803 旁白 neutral]]
As the novel's content filled her mind, Chi Xiaocheng stood at the school gate, her eyes gradually filling with joy. [[804 旁白 happy]]
The first ten of these chapters described how the original Chi Xiaocheng scratched Su Tao's face and was then killed by Ye Liang after exposing her chest. [[805 旁白 neutral]]
The next ten chapters... [[806 旁白 neutral]]
