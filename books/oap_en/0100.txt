Chapter 100: Development Plan (Extra chapter for x-melody) [[8656 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was very troubled. [[8657 旁白 neutral]]
It was true she had a system, but Emotion Points couldn't be exchanged for money. [[8658 旁白 neutral]]
She had hacking skills, but that didn't mean she could break the law to get illegal money. There were plenty of jobs on the dark web, but what could a weak girl like Chi Xiaocheng do? [[8659 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen had also made it clear that he couldn't provide that much cash. [[8660 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang had money, but he was just a bit naive, not an idiot. A few tens of thousands might have been fine, but tens of millions wasn't something Chi Xiaocheng could get just by acting cute. [[8661 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother, is it okay if we don't pay the ten million?" [[8662 池小橙 sad]]
"It's mainly my fault. I didn't hold back," Chi Song said, looking guilty. "The doctor said Ye Liang's 'third leg' was almost ruined. If he's lucky, it can be treated. If not, he might be impotent for life." [[8663 池松 sad]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng was stunned. [[8664 旁白 neutral]]
Wow, her brother basically neutered this male lead! [[8665 池小橙 happy]]
If he's unlucky, he'll have no sex life for the rest of his life? [[8666 池小橙 happy]]
Isn't this the perfect poison apple to shatter his male lead aura? [[8667 池小橙 happy]]
Ten million to make a male lead exit the stage for good... that sounds like a great deal. [[8668 池小橙 happy]]
"The person we spoke to last time was the Ye family's second young master," Chi Song continued. "He doesn't seem to get along with Ye Liang. He told Dongfang Yang and me that openly." [[8669 池松 neutral]]
"The Ye family is furious about losing face and will definitely come after us. He doesn't care about the ten million; it's a payment to show the Ye family. If we pay him, he'll help us push Ye Liang out of the family." [[8670 池松 neutral]]
"The Ye family's second young master..." [[8671 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng remembered this person from the original novel. [[8672 旁白 neutral]]
The original owner of her body had lived until Chapter 100. After she died, her brother appeared and survived until Chapter 300. After he died, he left behind a huge mess. [[8673 旁白 neutral]]
Jiuzhou City and Lizhi City were thrown into complete chaos. [[8674 旁白 neutral]]
The Ye family's second young master used the incident as a scandal to force Ye Liang out of the family. The two of them were like fire and water. [[8675 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she had brought her brother over from Lizhi City ahead of schedule, creating a butterfly effect, the villains who were meant to appear were still showing up, following the original story's path. [[8676 旁白 neutral]]
Is this the world correcting itself? [[8677 池小橙 neutral]]
Among all the characters, the only one who had awakened on their own was Chen Qian, a cannon-fodder villain just like her, who didn't even survive for ten chapters after appearing. [[8678 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Chi Xiaocheng was thinking, Chi Song took a deep breath and said in a serious tone, "Leave the money to me. I'll handle it." [[8679 池松 neutral]]
"Brother?" [[8680 池小橙 neutral]]
While she was still confused, Chi Song had already taken out his phone and made a call. [[8681 旁白 neutral]]
A bold voice came through the phone, "Songzi, is that you? How are things back home? Are you enjoying yourself?" [[8682 龙哥 happy]]
Chi Song glanced at Chi Xiaocheng beside him and cleared his throat. [[8683 旁白 neutral]]
He said to Chi Xiaocheng, "Little sister, this is Brother Long. He's the foreman at the construction site where I worked. He's been very good to me." [[8684 池松 neutral]]
Brother Long was also surprised for a moment, then laughed heartily. "So our little sister is there too! Ah, the construction site really isn't the same without you, Songzi. The new guys can't even carry ten bricks at once." [[8685 龙哥 happy]]
Chi Song chuckled. "Of course. I can carry 15 bricks at once. I was the strongest in our team." [[8686 池松 happy]]
"Brother, a brick is about 5 centimeters thick. 15 bricks stacked up would be half as tall as me. You can carry that with one hand?" [[8687 池小橙 neutral]]
"Uh..." Chi Song was at a loss for words, saying awkwardly, "We were talking about back when your brother was in his prime. I'm not educated, I just have brute strength." [[8688 池松 neutral]]
"I'm Xiaocheng. Thank you for taking care of my brother, Brother Long. He's a bit naive, so I'm sure he's caused you a lot of trouble." [[8689 池小橙 happy]]
She was well-behaved, sensible, and sweet. [[8690 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't ask what they did, and her words of thanks and concern were sincere. [[8691 旁白 neutral]]
Brother Long was stunned for a good while after hearing her, then sighed with emotion, "Songzi, you have to cherish a sister like this. If I hadn't made that mistake back then, my daughter would be in middle school by now, about the same age as our sister." [[8692 龙哥 sad]]
"Brother Long, you've been so good to me. We're brothers. My sister already called you Brother Long, so she's our little sister now." [[8693 池松 happy]]
Brother Long's bold voice sounded again. "Alright, let's stop this sentimental talk between two grown men. Why did you call me?" [[8694 龙哥 happy]]
"It's like this, Brother Long," Chi Song said, embarrassed as he explained what happened. "So... I was wondering if... you have any spare cash." [[8695 池松 sad]]
Asking his boss for ten million was something only a straightforward guy like Chi Song could do. [[8696 旁白 neutral]]
If his boss had even a hint of suspicion or distrust, their relationship would have been over. [[8697 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how you looked at it, it seemed like he was planning to run away with the money. [[8698 旁白 neutral]]
For an ordinary gang involved in underground business, ten million was definitely not a small sum. [[8699 旁白 neutral]]
Even Chi Xiaocheng thought her brother was being impulsive. [[8700 旁白 neutral]]
How could he survive in the gang after making his relationship with his boss so awkward? [[8701 旁白 neutral]]
However, Brother Long just laughed. "I was wondering why all of the Ye family's influence and businesses here in Lizhi City were in chaos. So it was you, kid." [[8702 龙哥 happy]]
"Good job!" Brother Long's voice was excited. "My men were running into obstacles, but a week ago, for some reason, the Ye family's forces suddenly tried to pull out." [[8703 龙哥 happy]]
"I can't give you ten million, but five million is possible." [[8704 龙哥 neutral]]
Chi Song was very touched. "Five million is enough! Thank you, Brother Long. I'll figure out the other five million myself!" [[8705 池松 happy]]
"No way. Last time, I checked the organization you paid for our little sister's medical fees and found out it was a scam. I took some time to go to your hometown and shut them down. I recovered 5 million for you, so that's a perfect match." [[8706 龙哥 neutral]]
Her brother was scammed out of five million? [[8707 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked confused but didn't say anything. [[8708 旁白 neutral]]
She heard Brother Long continue, "Actually, Songzi, I was going to call you even if you didn't call me. The Ye family's second young master contacted me through the Si family's connections and said we could cooperate." [[8709 龙哥 neutral]]
"Consider this ten million a loan from you to me, as a way to open the door to the Ye family's second young master. Once I take over all of the Ye family's businesses in Lizhi City, I'll pay you back double!" [[8710 龙哥 happy]]
Her surprise turned into delight. [[8711 旁白 neutral]]
If the ten million went directly to Ye Liang, Chi Xiaocheng would have felt terrible. [[8712 旁白 neutral]]
But now, it was being used as startup capital for Brother Long to connect with the Ye family's second young master. Then her brother would be sent back to Lizhi City, and with Brother Long's ability, he would definitely establish a firm foothold there. [[8713 旁白 neutral]]
If her brother develops his own power, that's her power too! [[8714 池小橙 happy]]
Maybe one day her plan to fake her own death would succeed, and she could run off to Lizhi City, leave Su Tao on her own for a few months, and then make a dramatic comeback. [[8715 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng became excited. [[8716 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she expected, Brother Long continued, "But Songzi, you might have to come back soon. I don't have many people here I can fully trust, and you're one of them!" [[8717 龙哥 neutral]]
Hearing this, Chi Song's blood rushed to his head, and he yelled, "No problem, Brother Long! I'll be back tomorrow!" [[8718 池松 happy]]
"Hahaha, no need to be in such a hurry. Spend a couple more days with your little sister." [[8719 龙哥 happy]]
A sly look appeared in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes as she said sweetly to Brother Long, "Brother Long, you mean 'our' little sister~" [[8720 池小橙 happy]]
