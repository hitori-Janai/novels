Chapter 170: A Not-So-Perfect Ending [[14861 旁白 neutral]]
When do people most easily feel helpless, weak, and insignificant? [[14862 旁白 neutral]]
It's when something is clearly within reach, but you just can't grasp it. It's when there were many chances to turn things around, but you stubbornly walked down the only wrong path. [[14863 旁白 neutral]]
Just like when she was crying for help, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't save her. [[14864 旁白 neutral]]
I couldn't even get revenge for her. [[14865 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao slammed her fist on the rooftop's iron door. The "bang" was drowned out by the sound of gunshots outside. [[14866 旁白 angry]]
"Brother Chi Song, let me out!" [[14867 苏桃 angry]]
"I want to get revenge for Xiaocheng too! Let me out!" [[14868 苏桃 angry]]
"Brother Chi Song!!!" [[14869 苏桃 angry]]
She hit the iron door again and again. After the first gunshot from outside, it gradually became quiet. [[14870 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao, already exhausted physically and mentally, ran out of strength. Her pounding became weaker, and her straight posture slowly slumped. [[14871 旁白 sad]]
With a "thud," she knelt on the ground. [[14872 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao weakly raised her hands to grab the door lock, using its support to keep from collapsing, but her head hung low, resting against the door as tears fell endlessly. [[14873 旁白 sad]]
Why! [[14874 苏桃 sad]]
Why are you doing this to me? [[14875 苏桃 sad]]
Is this my punishment for abandoning Xiaocheng? [[14876 苏桃 sad]]
Brother Chi Song, tell me. [[14877 苏桃 sad]]
"Why... why won't you even give me a chance to avenge Xiaocheng..." [[14878 苏桃 sad]]
Just then, another "bang" from a gunshot echoed. Su Tao knew that things were about to end. [[14879 旁白 sad]]
Ye Liang, already seriously injured and on the ground, was no match for Chi Song, who had a gun. [[14880 旁白 neutral]]
With a "creak," the rooftop's iron door was pulled open again by Chi Song. [[14881 旁白 neutral]]
Kneeling on the ground, Su Tao lifelessly raised her face. [[14882 旁白 sad]]
Her cheeks were covered in dust, her hair was a mess, and her eyes were empty. Fresh tears still streamed down, and her damp hair, losing its usual beauty, clung to her face in clumps. A strand stuck to her lips like a scar on the young girl's face. [[14883 旁白 sad]]
Meeting Chi Song's complicated gaze, Su Tao's eyes focused slightly. "Brother Chi Song, is Ye Liang dead?" [[14884 苏桃 sad]]
"He's dead." [[14885 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song nodded lightly and bent down to help Su Tao up. [[14886 旁白 neutral]]
But the kneeling girl didn't take his outstretched hand. Instead, she stared blankly at the rooftop behind him. [[14887 旁白 sad]]
The sky was dark, but a little moonlight still sprinkled down, as if trying hard to keep the world bright. [[14888 旁白 neutral]]
The moonlight seeped in through the doorway, most of it falling on Chi Song, and a small part shone through the gap, as if trying to reach Su Tao. [[14889 旁白 neutral]]
However, the moonlight stopped just in front of Su Tao. [[14890 旁白 sad]]
A straight shadow stopped less than half a meter in front of her. [[14891 旁白 sad]]
She knew it was just the angle of the moon, that she was too far from the doorway for the light to reach her. [[14892 旁白 neutral]]
This was a law of nature, a matter of physics. [[14893 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she knew this, she still felt empty and lonely, still felt like the moonlight was rejecting her. [[14894 旁白 sad]]
It was as if it was saying: Your white moonlight is already dead. [[14895 旁白 sad]]
You are not worthy of bathing in this moonlight. [[14896 旁白 sad]]
Ye Liang was dead, but why didn't she feel happy? Instead, an endless emptiness washed over her. [[14897 旁白 sad]]
Does this count as getting revenge? [[14898 旁白 sad]]
And after getting revenge, what should I do now? [[14899 旁白 sad]]
I didn't kill him with my own hands. Does this really count as revenge? Will Xiaocheng really forgive me? [[14900 旁白 sad]]
Or maybe... [[14901 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's gaze drifted beyond the rooftop. [[14902 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps jumping from this 30-story building to be with Xiaocheng is also an option? [[14903 旁白 sad]]
While her thoughts were running wild, Chi Song reached out and firmly grabbed Su Tao's arm, pulling her up. [[14904 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao slowly came back to her senses, not daring to meet Chi Song's eyes. [[14905 旁白 sad]]
She could only lower her head, standing unsteadily and miserably. Her lips trembled for a long time, wanting to say those two words, "Sor..." [[14906 旁白 sad]]
"Sorry." [[14907 池松 sad]]
However, Chi Song said the two words a step faster than Su Tao. [[14908 旁白 neutral]]
With her head down, Su Tao's eyes widened suddenly, and for a moment, even her hands clenched tightly. [[14909 旁白 sad]]
"Why?" Su Tao bit her lip, forcing the word out. [[14910 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Song didn't hear Su Tao's quiet words and asked, "What did you say?" [[14911 池松 neutral]]
"I said, why!" Su Tao looked up, confused and lost, at Chi Song. "Why is Brother Chi Song apologizing?" [[14912 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Song opened his mouth but hadn't answered yet. [[14913 旁白 neutral]]
A self-mocking smile appeared on Su Tao's lips. "I'm clearly the one who's wrong, so why is Brother Chi Song apologizing?" [[14914 苏桃 sad]]
The string in her heart snapped completely again. She grabbed Chi Song's collar and yelled, "I'm the one who didn't protect Xiaocheng, I'm the one who got her killed! It's all my fault, so why is Brother Chi Song apologizing!" [[14915 苏桃 angry]]
"You entrusted Xiaocheng to me, and Uncle and Auntie also told me to take care of her. You all trusted me with her." [[14916 苏桃 sad]]
"You all thought I could take good care of her, protect her!" [[14917 苏桃 sad]]
"But what happened!" [[14918 苏桃 angry]]
"What happened..." [[14919 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao clenched her fist, and her other hand hit Chi Song's shoulder, but with no strength at all. [[14920 旁白 sad]]
Her voice changed from a roar to a hoarse, self-blaming cry. "Because of me, she's dead!" [[14921 苏桃 sad]]
"I didn't take care of her!" [[14922 苏桃 sad]]
"I didn't protect her!" [[14923 苏桃 sad]]
"I should have been the one to die, but now she's the one who's dead!" [[14924 苏桃 sad]]
"Brother Chi Song..." Su Tao's voice grew weak from shouting, and she started crying on his shoulder again. "I'm begging you... please don't take away my guilt and remorse for Xiaocheng, okay? Otherwise... otherwise I'll have nothing left, I'm begging you..." [[14925 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng is already gone. [[14926 旁白 sad]]
Besides these feelings, how else can I prove that Xiaocheng ever lived in this world? [[14927 旁白 sad]]
Are you going to take even these things away from me! [[14928 旁白 angry]]
However, after hearing this, Chi Song was silent for a long time. [[14929 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't put all the blame on her as Su Tao wished. [[14930 旁白 neutral]]
He just said in a heavy voice, "It's not your fault. I'm the one who didn't protect you guys. I knew you might be in danger, but I still left Jiuzhou City." [[14931 池松 sad]]
Before he left, he only left a few of his men near the neighborhood. [[14932 旁白 neutral]]
No one expected that a killer would use a sniper rifle in a busy city. [[14933 旁白 neutral]]
He comforted her, "Tao, don't overthink it. My little sister wouldn't blame you." [[14934 池松 sad]]
"But I wish you would blame me!" [[14935 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao suddenly let go of Chi Song and shouted in despair, "Why are you being so gentle with me? Why don't you scold me? Doesn't this just make me seem like a burden to Xiaocheng!!!" [[14936 苏桃 angry]]
The pent-up emotions that had nowhere to go gradually turned into self-blaming curses and crying. [[14937 旁白 sad]]
Tears soaked his shoulder, and her voice echoed in the stairwell. [[14938 旁白 sad]]
Dongfang Yang rushed over, wanting to go to the rooftop, but was stopped by Long Ge. [[14939 旁白 neutral]]
The man with one ear missing lit a cigarette and said softly to Dongfang Yang, "Don't go up. Give them some space." [[14940 龙哥 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was silent, clenched his fist, and punched the wall hard again. [[14941 旁白 angry]]
Ye Liang was dead, and Chi Xiaocheng had been avenged. [[14942 旁白 sad]]
But why didn't he feel any happiness at all? [[14943 旁白 sad]]
If this fixed reality were a game, Su Tao would be the protagonist and Ye Liang the villain. [[14944 旁白 neutral]]
The heroine, Xiaocheng, was killed by the villain to save the protagonist, and the protagonist gathered her teammates to defeat the villain. [[14945 旁白 neutral]]
But what kind of story ends without its heroine? [[14946 旁白 sad]]
If parallel universes exist, then in which timeline is the ending a perfect one? [[14947 旁白 sad]]
Hearing Su Tao's heart-wrenching cries, Dongfang Yang couldn't help but sigh. [[14948 旁白 sad]]
At least this timeline is a bad ending. [[14949 旁白 sad]]
