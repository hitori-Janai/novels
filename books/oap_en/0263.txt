Chapter 263: A New Direction for Cultivating Yandere Taotao (Extra chapter for Mengmeng) [[22402 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she was extremely reluctant, Su Tao didn't dare to directly stimulate Chi Xiaocheng's memories. [[22403 旁白 neutral]]
As a result, she began to pack up her belongings in the room. [[22404 旁白 neutral]]
Pillows, clothes, toiletries... [[22405 旁白 neutral]]
The signs of her presence in the room were disappearing, little by little. [[22406 旁白 sad]]
And the person erasing them was, ironically, herself. [[22407 旁白 sad]]
Holding a set of her pajamas, Su Tao looked at Chi Xiaocheng with a last glimmer of hope in her eyes. [[22408 旁白 sad]]
But the little girl with long, brown hair was sitting on the edge of the bed, her back turned to Su Tao. [[22409 旁白 neutral]]
She had changed into comfortable shorts and was holding her phone, her fair calves dangling attractively. Her small feet, still in white socks, swung back and forth happily. [[22410 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't dare to get closer to see who she was chatting with. [[22411 旁白 sad]]
She just lowered her head sadly and walked out of the room. [[22412 旁白 sad]]
Of course, she didn't notice that as she turned, Chi Xiaocheng also turned to look at her retreating figure. [[22413 旁白 neutral]]
She gently put on the Status Glasses. [[22414 旁白 neutral]]
The corners of her lips curled into a meaningful smile. [[22415 旁白 neutral]]
[Su Tao] [[22416 系统 neutral]]
[Height: 166] [[22417 系统 neutral]]
[Weight: 96→97] [[22418 系统 neutral]]
[Bust: C] [[22419 系统 neutral]]
[Current Status: Self-blame, Lack of Confidence, Impatience, Overly Hesitant, Self-Avoidance, Mild Daze, Mild Self-Loathing, Mild Stress, Mild Paranoia] [[22420 系统 neutral]]
[General Affection for Host: 99 (She sees you as the most important person in her life)] [[22421 系统 neutral]]
[Romantic Affection for Host: 71→75 (During your memory loss, she has fully accepted her feelings for you and is clearly aware that she gets jealous when you interact with others. Fang Ning, Dongfang Yang, and Si Chen are all seen as potential rivals due to her insecurity; [[22422 系统 neutral]]
Even with her traditional views on gender, she hopes you will love her again like before. However, this affection, born from impatience, is not stable, and her forced attempts to increase it will become slower and slower)] [[22423 系统 neutral]]
[Possessive Affection for Host: 65→69 (Because of your memory loss, she has become insecure and conflicted. She has the urge to possess you but is afraid of hurting you because of your memory issues; [[22424 系统 neutral]]
She subconsciously believes her relationship with you is steadily improving and that things will return to normal if they continue to develop slowly; [[22425 系统 neutral]]
Your deliberate closeness with Fang Ning and the others has made her feel a sense of crisis, which has subconsciously increased her possessiveness. But to increase it further, she might need to face the reality of you leaving her)] [[22426 系统 neutral]]
The numbers had increased, but Chi Xiaocheng was still a little dissatisfied with the progress. [[22427 池小橙 neutral]]
According to the System's explanation, without a new breakthrough, the latter two affection levels were approaching their current limits. [[22428 旁白 neutral]]
To break past 70 in possessiveness, she needed to take drastic measures. [[22429 池小橙 neutral]]
As for the romantic affection getting stuck at 75 and rising slowly, Chi Xiaocheng had expected that. [[22430 池小橙 neutral]]
The affection she forced upon herself couldn't truly become love. Her own prediction was that it would get stuck around 80. [[22431 池小橙 neutral]]
Without experiencing a better side of her, it would be difficult for the affection to increase. [[22432 旁白 neutral]]
For now, it was easier to cultivate possessiveness. [[22433 池小橙 neutral]]
And now, with Emotion Points to spare, Chi Xiaocheng began to look at the upgrade options for the Status Glasses. [[22434 旁白 neutral]]
Previously, in order to find Lin Fangya, she had spent a lot, and her Emotion Points had dropped below 3000. [[22435 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't even afford a poison apple. [[22436 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng never expected that during her "friendly interaction" with Lin Fangya, this side character, who was supposed to die in a few chapters, would provide her with a huge amount of Emotion Points in such a short time! [[22437 旁白 happy]]
Not only did it cover all her expenses from that night, but she ended up with even more than before! [[22438 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's Emotion Points now stood at a whopping 5500! [[22439 旁白 happy]]
The pain Lin Fangya felt that night, the resentment, regret, pleading, despair, and the ultimate fear of death, had given Chi Xiaocheng nearly 3000 Emotion Points in an instant. [[22440 旁白 happy]]
This "power bank" was even more effective than Chu Lingfeng. [[22441 旁白 happy]]
A minor character like her, with a low character weight, shouldn't have been able to provide many Emotion Points. [[22442 旁白 neutral]]
Just like Chen Qian, who had a name in the original story but only gave Chi Xiaocheng ten or so points even during large emotional fluctuations. [[22443 旁白 neutral]]
It was better than nothing. [[22444 旁白 neutral]]
She thought Lin Fangya would be the same, but she didn't expect that as her character weight increased, the Emotion Points she could provide also increased. [[22445 旁白 neutral]]
According to the System. [[22446 系统 neutral]]
If she hadn't dealt with her this time. [[22447 系统 neutral]]
If she had been chosen by the world's will and continued to grow, she might have become another major boss like Ye Liang. [[22448 系统 neutral]]
In Jiuzhou City, there weren't many important characters. After Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, and the others began to gravitate towards Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng, Chu Lingfeng lost many of his connections, and his presence began to diminish with less screen time. [[22449 旁白 neutral]]
Even as one of the protagonists, his storyline wasn't the focus for now. [[22450 旁白 neutral]]
And it wasn't time for the wealthy female villain, who practically represented the world's will, to make her appearance. [[22451 旁白 neutral]]
After the original lead villain, Ye Liang, died, the world's will had no one to choose and set its sights on Lin Fangya. [[22452 旁白 neutral]]
This caused her status in the novel's world to rise. Chi Xiaocheng's actions last night were indeed a bit extreme, but she had coincidentally eliminated a future villain with great potential. [[22453 旁白 neutral]]
Now that she had Emotion Points, she could finally look at the various upgrade paths for the Status Glasses. [[22454 旁白 happy]]
[Status Glasses Upgrade Path 1: Body Attributes (1000 Emotion Points): See the target's various attachments to your physical features. For example, with the female lead Su Tao: Lips (Slightly Addicted), Hair (Likes), Feet (Slightly Desires)...] [[22455 系统 neutral]]
[Status Glasses Upgrade Path 2: External Configuration (2000 Emotion Points): See the target's affection levels for your friends. For example, with the female lead Su Tao, you can see her affection data for Dongfang Yang, or for Fang Ning...] [[22456 系统 neutral]]
[Status Glasses Upgrade Path 3: Customized Values (3000 Emotion Points): Customize the values a person sees. Grants the ability to lend the glasses. For example, if you lend the glasses to Su Tao, she can see your true affection for her, or she can see the fake affection you have customized.] [[22457 系统 neutral]]
Besides these three, there were more powerful and more expensive upgrade paths. [[22458 旁白 neutral]]
But with Chi Xiaocheng's current Emotion Points, looking at the later ones would only make her envious. [[22459 旁白 neutral]]
The first option was undoubtedly useless, but Chi Xiaocheng was very curious about the second and third. [[22460 池小橙 neutral]]
Especially the third one, Customized Values! [[22461 池小橙 happy]]
Imagine a scene where Su Tao accidentally puts on the Status Glasses and discovers the data this high-tech device can display. [[22462 池小橙 happy]]
When she looks at Chi Xiaocheng, what would happen if the glasses showed that her affection for Su Tao was 0, or even negative? [[22463 池小橙 happy]]
The outcome was a bit uncertain, and Chi Xiaocheng didn't dare to think about it too much. [[22464 池小橙 neutral]]
Just as the description said, it gave her the possibility of lending the glasses out. [[22465 池小橙 neutral]]
It gave her a new idea for cultivating her Taotao! [[22466 池小橙 happy]]
The thought of Su Tao discovering that her Xiaocheng no longer belonged to her, and then becoming anxious enough to turn to the dark side, made Chi Xiaocheng hum a little tune. [[22467 池小橙 happy]]
But, it wasn't time for that yet. [[22468 池小橙 neutral]]
She shook her head lightly, took out her phone, and tapped on Dr. Cheng's account. She silently counted to ten. [[22469 池小橙 neutral]]
With a "ding," a message arrived from the user named "Peach is the Cutest." [[22470 旁白 neutral]]
A mischievous smile involuntarily appeared on the little girl's lips. [[22471 旁白 happy]]
Oh, Xiaocheng, Xiaocheng, being so cunning with Taotao. [[22472 旁白 happy]]
