Chapter 12 Don't You Want Some Water? [[978 旁白 neutral]]
Whenever her tongue touched the cut inside her lip, the pain would remind Su Tao of what happened in the basement. [[979 旁白 neutral]]
Her first kiss was gone. [[980 旁白 sad]]
She was also forced to lie to Ye Liang. [[981 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng had become someone she didn't recognize at all, and had said things Su Tao never thought she would say. [[982 旁白 sad]]
For the past two days, she had been thinking a lot, but she hadn't talked about it with anyone. No matter how hard she thought, she couldn't figure out why Chi Xiaocheng had become like this. [[983 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't understand, she couldn't figure it out. [[984 旁白 neutral]]
So, she decided to avoid her for the time being. [[985 旁白 neutral]]
But to her surprise, Chi Xiaocheng actually came to the school basketball game. [[986 旁白 neutral]]
"Is she here to see me?" [[987 苏桃 neutral]]
"Or is she here to cheer for Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang?" [[988 苏桃 neutral]]
For some reason, another thought popped into Su Tao's mind. [[989 旁白 neutral]]
"Didn't Xiaocheng say she doesn't like Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang?" [[990 苏桃 neutral]]
With this strange thought in her mind, the game started soon after. As the male leads of the novel, Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang were, of course, practically good at everything. [[991 旁白 neutral]]
The two teams were evenly matched, and one cool shot after another made most of the girls in the audience scream with excitement. [[992 旁白 neutral]]
Halfway through the match, Chi Xiaocheng sneaked a peek at Su Tao. [[993 旁白 neutral]]
She saw that Su Tao's eyes were also sparkling with excitement. [[994 旁白 neutral]]
Although her feelings about her were complex. [[995 旁白 neutral]]
It was clear that Su Tao also had a very good impression of the male leads. [[996 旁白 neutral]]
Noticing the two unopened bottles of water beside her, Chi Xiaocheng's eyes shifted. [[997 旁白 neutral]]
She turned to a boy behind her and said with a sweet smile, "Hey, could you do me a favor?" [[998 池小橙 happy]]
The boy was taken aback by Chi Xiaocheng suddenly talking to him, and his eyes lingered on her cute, delicate face for a couple of seconds. [[999 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't mind, and even gave a playful blink. [[1000 旁白 happy]]
The boy quickly snapped out of it and nodded nervously, "N-No problem." [[1001 陌生男1 neutral]]
"I'm a bit thirsty. Could you buy two bottles of water for me?" [[1002 池小橙 neutral]]
"T-Two bottles?" [[1003 陌生男1 neutral]]
The boy nodded blankly, secretly happy. [[1004 旁白 happy]]
He was thirsty too, so one bottle for each of them would be perfect. [[1005 旁白 happy]]
The game was still going on. The boy, with the pretty girl on his mind, ran back quickly. He handed one bottle to Chi Xiaocheng, but just as he was about to open the other one, he saw her reach out for it. [[1006 旁白 neutral]]
He froze for a second. "What's wrong?" [[1007 陌生男1 neutral]]
"It was two bottles." Chi Xiaocheng said with an innocent face. [[1008 池小橙 neutral]]
The boy looked at his friend next to him, then back at Chi Xiaocheng, confused. "Are you drinking two bottles by yourself?" [[1009 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Oh, they're not for me. I'm giving them to Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang later." [[1010 池小橙 neutral]]
These simple, plain words instantly made the boy's heart sink. [[1011 旁白 sad]]
I bought water for a pretty girl, and she's using the water I bought to give to other guys. [[1012 陌生男1 sad]]
"Then what does that make me?" [[1013 陌生男1 sad]]
He numbly handed over the water. Then, he saw Chi Xiaocheng take out her small wallet and pull out a 5-yuan bill. [[1014 旁白 neutral]]
She placed it in his hand. "Thank you, little bro~" [[1015 池小橙 happy]]
Two bottles of water only cost four yuan. [[1016 旁白 neutral]]
She even gave him a one-yuan tip for running the errand! [[1017 旁白 neutral]]
The boy felt his nose turning red and as if he was wearing a clown's frizzy wig. [[1018 旁白 sad]]
His love story was over before it even began. [[1019 旁白 sad]]
His friend next to him silently patted his shoulder and stood up. "Let's go, or Batman will be here to catch the Joker soon." [[1020 陌生男1 sad]]
Soon, the first half of the game ended. [[1021 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's blue team was in the lead. [[1022 旁白 neutral]]
It was break time. [[1023 旁白 neutral]]
The boys on both teams were drenched in sweat, and girls were constantly giving them water and towels, except for Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang. [[1024 旁白 neutral]]
These two were true campus idols, famous and well-respected, so most people didn't dare to approach them. [[1025 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, didn't everyone know they were both pursuing Su Tao? [[1026 旁白 neutral]]
The main character was right here, after all. [[1027 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Su Tao picked up a bottle of water and was about to get up. [[1028 旁白 neutral]]
Another small figure was faster than her. [[1029 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng grabbed a bottle of water, trotted over to Dongfang Yang, and showed a silly smile. "Master Dongfang, would you like some water?" [[1030 池小橙 happy]]
She held the water with both hands, her face full of anticipation. [[1031 旁白 happy]]
It was as if this was some precious treasure. [[1032 旁白 happy]]
Dongfang Yang chuckled and shook his head. "No, thank you." [[1033 东方阳 neutral]]
Although his opinion of Chi Xiaocheng had changed, he definitely wouldn't accept water from her in front of everyone. [[1034 旁白 neutral]]
Especially not in front of Su Tao. [[1035 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, the disappointment on Chi Xiaocheng's face flashed for a moment. [[1036 旁白 sad]]
With a burst of great acting, she let Dongfang Yang catch that trace of emotion, then forced a smile. "If you want some water, you can tell me." [[1037 池小橙 sad]]
She turned around. [[1038 旁白 neutral]]
The System's voice echoed in her mind. [[1039 旁白 neutral]]
【Emotion Points +4...】 [[1040 系统 neutral]]
【Emotion Points +7...】 [[1041 系统 neutral]]
【Emotion Points +2...】 [[1042 系统 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was surprised that she still dared to give him water in front of so many people, especially when Su Tao had already stood up. [[1043 旁白 neutral]]
"She's doing this on purpose!" [[1044 东方阳 angry]]
Of course, Chi Xiaocheng was doing it on purpose. [[1045 旁白 neutral]]
She just didn't expect to earn some Emotion Points this way. [[1046 旁白 happy]]
So, she turned around again. [[1047 旁白 neutral]]
And walked towards Ye Liang. [[1048 旁白 neutral]]
That silly smile instantly turned a little fearful as she stood before him, holding out the water bottle with both hands. [[1049 旁白 sad]]
Before she could even speak. [[1050 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang slapped the water bottle to the ground. [[1051 旁白 angry]]
"How dare you show up in front of me and pretend? Get lost!" [[1052 叶良 angry]]
His voice was filled with anger, and his annoyance also provided Chi Xiaocheng with 23 Emotion Points. [[1053 旁白 neutral]]
The water bottle rolled a few times and stopped at the feet of a girl with bleached-blonde hair. [[1054 旁白 neutral]]
She stepped on it. [[1055 旁白 neutral]]
The girl looked at Chi Xiaocheng with a sneer. [[1056 旁白 neutral]]
The small figure stood in the empty space cleared by the crowd, looking so wronged and helpless. [[1057 旁白 sad]]
Seeing this, Dongfang Yang frowned and couldn't help but say to Ye Liang, "Was that necessary? There are so many people here, watch your image." [[1058 东方阳 neutral]]
Ye Liang snorted coldly. "What, Dongfang Yang, you feel sorry for this girl now? I haven't even settled the score with her yet and she dares to come near. If Su Tao hadn't stopped me, she would have disappeared from this school yesterday. Just looking at her makes me want to puke." [[1059 叶良 angry]]
From beginning to end, he never looked at Chi Xiaocheng directly. [[1060 旁白 neutral]]
That pale, makeup-free face was pitiful, but if you don't look, how can you be charmed? [[1061 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked back to her seat, looking lost. She picked up the last bottle of water and slowly looked at Su Tao. "Tao Tao, do you... want some water?" [[1062 池小橙 sad]]
After being rejected by two people in a row. [[1063 旁白 sad]]
She seemed to be looking for some comfort. [[1064 旁白 sad]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng's sad expression and poor state, Su Tao wanted to take the water and comfort her. [[1065 旁白 neutral]]
But Ye Liang walked over from a distance, huffing coldly. [[1066 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao shrank back, glanced at him, and after hesitating, she shook her head. "Sorry, Xiaocheng, I'm not thirsty right now. I don't really want any water." [[1067 苏桃 sad]]
"Thud!" [[1068 旁白 neutral]]
The water bottle she was holding fell heavily to the ground. [[1069 旁白 sad]]
The onlookers who were just watching the drama now looked at her with either scorn or pity. [[1070 旁白 neutral]]
"I see, so Tao Tao doesn't want water..." [[1071 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice was quiet, but it was just loud enough for Su Tao to hear. [[1072 旁白 neutral]]
She handed a bottle of water to Ye Liang, then turned her head and saw a faint smile on Chi Xiaocheng's lips. Her crimson eyes reflected the action of her handing over the water. [[1073 旁白 neutral]]
Her pupils seemed to have no light in them, completely empty. [[1074 旁白 sad]]
That dazed expression seemed to be sending Su Tao a message. [[1075 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's world. [[1076 旁白 sad]]
Had collapsed. [[1077 旁白 sad]]
