Chapter 59 You Already Like Me a Little~ [[5185 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng herself was very cute. [[5186 旁白 neutral]]
But besides passersby, everyone who looked at her had a slight filter. [[5187 旁白 neutral]]
Just like Su Tao, having grown up with her, how could she not know Chi Xiaocheng's beauty? [[5188 旁白 neutral]]
She was just used to it, always standing from an older sister's perspective, taking her beauty for granted, and seeing her cute actions as clumsiness. [[5189 旁白 neutral]]
But under Chi Xiaocheng's subtle influence during this period, the cuteness she now perceived. [[5190 旁白 neutral]]
Was the kind that belonged exclusively to girls. [[5191 旁白 neutral]]
Detached from her "older sister" perspective. [[5192 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Su Tao herself didn't realize that her heart had been stirred. [[5193 旁白 neutral]]
Turning her gaze away, Su Tao gently pushed Chi Xiaocheng out of her embrace. Somewhat flustered, she sought a point of escape, "N-next time, Xiaocheng, don't say that. How could I bear to treat you as a pet? You'll always be my good little sister." [[5194 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked, then touched her lips with her index finger again, asking with a giggle, "Is it really just a good little sister?" [[5195 池小橙 neutral]]
Or rather, given the circumstances, could she still be a "good little sister"? [[5196 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm very greedy, you know~" [[5197 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng came in front of Su Tao again, burrowing into her embrace. [[5198 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was about to say something when Chi Xiaocheng pressed her index finger against her lips, "Tao Tao, don't speak. Can I sleep in your arms?" [[5199 池小橙 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng..." [[5200 苏桃 neutral]]
"I can feel it." Chi Xiaocheng hugged Su Tao tightly, her voice soft, "Tao Tao, you already like me a little, don't you? Your eyes look different now. When I wake up, Tao Tao can be discharged~" [[5201 池小橙 neutral]]
"Discharged..." [[5202 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao murmured these two words. [[5203 旁白 neutral]]
Does being discharged mean she can leave here? [[5204 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't remember how long it had been, but it should be about a week, right? [[5205 旁白 neutral]]
In just one week, I fell in love with Xiaocheng? [[5206 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt the warmth in her embrace, her expression complex. [[5207 旁白 neutral]]
No, perhaps it's been more than a week. [[5208 旁白 neutral]]
And, I don't like Xiaocheng. [[5209 旁白 neutral]]
I'm just pretending to like her. [[5210 旁白 neutral]]
She was fooled by me. [[5211 旁白 neutral]]
That's why she said such things. [[5212 旁白 neutral]]
Just sleep, and everything will be back to normal when you wake up. [[5213 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao held the small body and lay down on the bed together. She closed her eyes, wanting to sleep, but she couldn't. [[5214 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's words kept echoing in her mind. [[5215 旁白 neutral]]
—You already like me~ [[5216 旁白 neutral]]
Even if it was just a little. [[5217 旁白 neutral]]
When a person realizes something that is independently different from their inner self and dares not accept, they will constantly think about it and defend themselves. [[5218 旁白 neutral]]
This is all protection from the subconscious. [[5219 旁白 neutral]]
In reality, Chi Xiaocheng knew better than Su Tao herself. [[5220 旁白 neutral]]
There wasn't much love, at most some good feelings. [[5221 旁白 neutral]]
The continuous pathological state for several days, followed by a sudden change to being obedient and cute, created a strong contrast that impacted Su Tao's heart and misled her feelings. [[5222 旁白 neutral]]
And at this point, Chi Xiaocheng only needed a slight inducement. [[5223 旁白 neutral]]
She could make Su Tao misunderstand herself further. [[5224 旁白 neutral]]
She would constantly think about this, constantly deny herself in her heart. Over time, the image of Chi Xiaocheng in her mind would never fade. [[5225 旁白 neutral]]
No need for Cinderella's handkerchief. [[5226 旁白 neutral]]
This effect was also achieved! [[5227 旁白 neutral]]
The incense burner with the soft bone powder was still working, but the room door was open. [[5228 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao desperately wanted to get out of here. She just wanted to get her phone and see what had happened outside for the past week or so. [[5229 旁白 neutral]]
Why hadn't anyone come looking for her? [[5230 旁白 neutral]]
It was understandable that Doctor Cheng didn't know her actual situation. [[5231 旁白 neutral]]
What about Si Chen? [[5232 旁白 neutral]]
What about Chen Qian? [[5233 旁白 neutral]]
After Ye Liang returned, he should have looked for her, right? [[5234 旁白 neutral]]
Why was there no movement for so many days? [[5235 旁白 neutral]]
But noticing Chi Xiaocheng, who seemed to be sound asleep in her arms, her anxious heart slowly calmed down. [[5236 旁白 neutral]]
These past few days, Xiaocheng must have been very tired too, right? [[5237 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng's voice just now wasn't as energetic as usual. [[5238 旁白 neutral]]
And the food... Su Tao forced herself to endure the discomfort in her heart and gradually analyzed it. [[5239 旁白 neutral]]
Taking water as an example, as long as it was fed through Xiaocheng's small mouth, the taste not only didn't change, but also had an alluring sweetness. [[5240 旁白 neutral]]
This also proved that Su Tao's sense of taste was not broken. [[5241 旁白 neutral]]
Those strange, rotten-tasting things might just be dark cuisine specially made by the outside vendors. [[5242 旁白 neutral]]
But why was this happening? Was Xiaocheng hinting to me in this way that she was actually the most wonderful one? [[5243 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng sound asleep, Su Tao couldn't help but touch her head. [[5244 旁白 neutral]]
But after reaching out, she felt a little scared. [[5245 旁白 neutral]]
The love of a yandere was a bit too heavy and extreme. [[5246 旁白 neutral]]
But could she blame Xiaocheng? [[5247 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled bitterly. [[5248 旁白 neutral]]
If she hadn't tested her, this wouldn't have happened, would it? [[5249 旁白 neutral]]
She knew she was a yandere, but she still couldn't believe it, and even used Ye Liang to provoke her. [[5250 旁白 neutral]]
Now that this had happened, it was all her own fault. [[5251 旁白 neutral]]
And she even caused Xiaocheng to enter a yandere state, harming her already frail body. [[5252 旁白 neutral]]
In self-reproach, Su Tao's embrace around Chi Xiaocheng became even gentler. [[5253 旁白 neutral]]
If Chi Xiaocheng knew that Su Tao attributed all the responsibility to herself, she would sigh again. [[5254 旁白 neutral]]
This is the female lead of the white moonlight type! [[5255 旁白 neutral]]
Just being by her side makes people unconsciously fall in love. [[5256 旁白 neutral]]
So, to prevent her from flirting around, she must be kept firmly by her side. [[5257 旁白 neutral]]
Sunlight streamed in from outside the window, but it couldn't penetrate the cracks in the window. The room remained dark even after the lights were turned off. [[5258 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao slept and woke, woke and slept. [[5259 旁白 neutral]]
But she found that it never reached the next day. [[5260 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind was hazy, and she was even more exhausted. [[5261 旁白 neutral]]
Every minute, every second, was an unbearable torment. [[5262 旁白 neutral]]
The only comfort was the soft warmth in her arms, and the occasional gentle snoring that dispelled her depression. [[5263 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng silently told her: No matter when, I will always be by your side. [[5264 旁白 neutral]]
Darkness, it seemed, was no longer so terrifying. [[5265 旁白 neutral]]
After an unknown period, Chi Xiaocheng, who was resting in Su Tao's arms, slowly woke up. [[5266 旁白 neutral]]
She sat up and rubbed her sleepy eyes, "What time is it? Tao Tao, why didn't you wake me up?" [[5267 池小橙 neutral]]
She used to say the same thing when she overslept and was almost late for high school. [[5268 旁白 neutral]]
Every movement, every plain word, seemed to evoke memories in her heart. [[5269 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao turned on the light beside her, "I don't know what time it is either. It should be morning, right?" [[5270 苏桃 neutral]]
"Oh, right." Chi Xiaocheng reacted, pulling Su Tao's hand and walking towards the door, "Since Tao Tao is well, you can be discharged now." [[5271 池小橙 neutral]]
Like a trapped bird, finally seeing the dawn of freedom. [[5272 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's steps were heavy yet expectant. The moment she stepped out of the room, a dazzling sunlight almost blinded her. [[5273 旁白 neutral]]
The afterglow reflected from the window glass gradually faded, and Su Tao squinted her eyes and walked to the window. [[5274 旁白 neutral]]
The rosy glow spread like fire, dyeing the clouds red. [[5275 旁白 neutral]]
Was that the morning sun? [[5276 旁白 neutral]]
Or the setting sun? [[5277 旁白 neutral]]
The afterglow sprinkled on her face. The warm light intertwined with dark memories. Su Tao dazedly picked up the phone Chi Xiaocheng had already placed on the table. [[5278 旁白 neutral]]
"Time..." [[5279 苏桃 neutral]]
Less than three days have passed?! [[5280 旁白 neutral]]
