Chapter 46 Host, Be Normal, This System is Scared [[3955 旁白 neutral]]
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over! [[3956 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng seemed to have lost her mind. [[3957 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't really kill me, would she?! [[3958 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen only felt the small knife almost touching his face. Although crimson had already dripped from his chin, he felt no pain at all. [[3959 旁白 neutral]]
Only a bone-chilling coldness. [[3960 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's eyes darted, looking at Chi Xiaocheng's face. [[3961 旁白 neutral]]
On her fair and slightly flushed cute face, a pair of strange vertical pupils stared intently at him. Strands of tea-colored hair hung down her cheeks, like sharp, thin steel wires. [[3962 旁白 neutral]]
He felt extremely nervous. [[3963 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's mind raced. He knew he couldn't stay in this stalemate, otherwise, if Chi Xiaocheng suddenly moved the knife, it would be bad! [[3964 旁白 neutral]]
Trying his best to relax his body and suppress any possible aggression, Si Chen chuckled dryly, "Well... Chi Xiaocheng, I was just lying to you. Actually, I..." [[3965 司辰 neutral]]
"Hiss—" [[3966 旁白 neutral]]
As he spoke, he gasped, the tip of the knife almost sliding upwards along his line of sight. Strands of his hair were neatly cut, finally stopping at his ear. [[3967 旁白 neutral]]
Scared, Si Chen quickly said, "Actually, I don't like Su Tao at all. I support you and Su Tao being together! I've disliked that little b*stard Ye Liang for a long time. Su Tao being Ye Liang's maid was also forced!" [[3968 司辰 neutral]]
"I can help you solve this!" [[3969 司辰 neutral]]
He finished this string of words in almost three seconds. [[3970 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen didn't even dare to breathe, feeling his hairs stand on end and goosebumps all over his body. [[3971 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, he saw the red light in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes recede a little, "You're lying to me?" [[3972 池小橙 neutral]]
"This time I'm not lying to you!" Si Chen directly sold out Su Tao, "This time I'm helping Su Tao test if you really like her, that's why I said that. Su Tao is afraid that your love for her is fake!" [[3973 司辰 neutral]]
"She's mine! I like her more than anyone!" [[3974 池小橙 angry]]
The dagger was pulled out and stabbed into the wall again. [[3975 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen nodded like a pecking chick, "Yes, yes, yes. I wasn't sure before, but now I feel it. Su Tao and I are just ordinary friends. I like petite, cute girls. I really don't like her!" [[3976 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned again, "You mean, you think Tao Tao isn't pretty or cute?" [[3977 池小橙 neutral]]
"Of course not!" Si Chen was very obedient, "Su Tao and you are the most beautiful in the world! You two are a perfect match! What kind of scoundrel is Ye Liang, daring to compete with you for Su Tao!" [[3978 司辰 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng, I swear to God, I'm on your and Su Tao's side!" [[3979 司辰 neutral]]
After a heartfelt and sincere speech, Chi Xiaocheng finally calmed down. [[3980 旁白 neutral]]
The knife against him was withdrawn. [[3981 旁白 neutral]]
The hand that had been pressing on his shoulder also retracted. It was no longer harmless as before, but the dazzling red light in her eyes had faded. [[3982 旁白 neutral]]
Those strange vertical pupils were also gradually receding. [[3983 旁白 neutral]]
Without Chi Xiaocheng's coercion, Si Chen was too weak to support himself with his hands and almost fell directly. [[3984 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, he felt extremely lucky. [[3985 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, she wasn't an incurable, severe yandere. [[3986 旁白 neutral]]
She still had some rationality left. [[3987 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stood aside, quietly watching Si Chen, appearing somewhat obedient, "You have a way to prevent Su Tao from being Ye Liang's maid?" [[3988 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen swallowed again, "Ye Liang demanded Su Tao be his maid simply because he was stood up at the last cruise banquet. I can use my family to create some trouble for him, so he won't have time to bother Su Tao." [[3989 司辰 neutral]]
"Good!" [[3990 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng responded, not caring what Si Chen thought, just assuming he had decided to help her. [[3991 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she glanced at his face, half-stained with crimson. [[3992 旁白 neutral]]
She took out a pack of tissues from her small bag. [[3993 旁白 neutral]]
She walked two steps to his side, "Here." [[3994 池小橙 neutral]]
"And..." She activated her acting skills, deliberately turning her head away to create a contrast of returning to normal, and whispered like a mosquito, "I'm sorry." [[3995 池小橙 neutral]]
After saying that, she threw the tissues on the ground. [[3996 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pulled her hood over her face and walked out of the alley with small steps. [[3997 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving Si Chen sitting on the ground, staring blankly at her staggering figure as she left. [[3998 旁白 neutral]]
Then he picked up the tissues, and for some reason, her fair side profile, turning away awkwardly and apologizing, appeared in his mind. [[3999 旁白 neutral]]
"This guy... seems pretty good when she's normal." [[4000 司辰 neutral]]
"Hiss—" [[4001 旁白 neutral]]
"It hurts so much! She looks so frail, where does she get so much strength?" [[4002 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen endured the belated pain, wiping his face and glasses with a tissue. Just as he was about to take out his phone to call a bodyguard, he suddenly froze. [[4003 旁白 neutral]]
His mind was filled with Chi Xiaocheng's pathological changes. [[4004 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a look of disbelief appeared in Si Chen's eyes, "Could it be..." [[4005 司辰 neutral]]
"Her purpose in approaching Su Tao and wanting to control her is also that?" [[4006 司辰 neutral]]
If that's the case... [[4007 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen took a deep breath, seemingly making a choice between Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao. [[4008 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, before night fell, Chi Xiaocheng quickly returned home. [[4009 旁白 neutral]]
Then, like Si Chen, her legs gave way and she sat directly on the cold floor, letting out a long sigh, "Finally... I should have gotten through it." [[4010 旁白 neutral]]
[Uh... Host, were you acting just now?] [[4011 系统 neutral]]
"Nonsense." Chi Xiaocheng retorted speechlessly, "Why do you always question me, System? What else could I be besides acting?" [[4012 池小橙 neutral]]
[But I feel like you were about to kill him just now. If he hadn't turned his head, you would have stabbed him in the face, right?] [[4013 系统 neutral]]
"I calculated it precisely before stabbing. Si Chen's identity is so sensitive, and he has the male lead's halo. It's not that easy for something to go wrong. If I couldn't make him lose his mind first, he would definitely see through my act." [[4014 池小橙 neutral]]
"There was nothing else I could do." [[4015 池小橙 neutral]]
Saying that, Chi Xiaocheng got up and walked towards her room with a calm expression. [[4016 旁白 neutral]]
The system stopped speaking. [[4017 旁白 neutral]]
It just thought to itself. [[4018 旁白 neutral]]
Can a person's acting really portray anger so well? [[4019 旁白 neutral]]
The blackening skill's multiplier was 7 times just now! [[4020 旁白 neutral]]
But the host also looked quite normal. She could even talk to Si Chen just now. [[4021 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe this system is overthinking it. [[4022 旁白 neutral]]
Resting, showering, and ordering takeout, Chi Xiaocheng gradually shed her fatigue. [[4023 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, she calculated the time. After waiting for a long time, she didn't receive any messages from Chen Qian, so she knew that Su Tao wouldn't come to confront her tonight. [[4024 旁白 neutral]]
Tomorrow night was her time to go to Ye Liang's place. [[4025 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps she would have to wait until tomorrow. [[4026 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pondered, went to bed early, and after eating a sleep chocolate she got from a previous draw, she fell into a deep sleep. [[4027 旁白 neutral]]
The next morning, with the alarm clock ringing, Su Tao woke up early. [[4028 旁白 neutral]]
Her hair was disheveled, and her eyes were sleepy. [[4029 旁白 neutral]]
She let out a long yawn and then noticed that someone in the dorm was up even earlier than her, "Qianqian, good morning." [[4030 苏桃 neutral]]
Chen Qian was sitting on her bed playing with her phone and greeted Su Tao, "Morning, Su Tao. Up so early? Are you going to Young Master Ye's place?" [[4031 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled and shook her head, "I have something more important today. I'm not going to Ye Liang's." [[4032 苏桃 neutral]]
Chen Qian's eyes flickered, "Is it about Chi Xiaocheng?" [[4033 陈倩 neutral]]
"Yes." Su Tao nodded, then smoothed her hair, "I don't know why, but I always feel a little uneasy. Do you think if I say that to Xiaocheng, her reaction will be too extreme?" [[4034 苏桃 neutral]]
"Relax. Is she going to imprison you or something?" The danger in Chen Qian's smile flashed and disappeared, "If anything happens, you can call me anytime, I'll help you!" [[4035 陈倩 neutral]]
"Okay, thank you, Qianqian." [[4036 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao patted her face, revealing a spirited smile. [[4037 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "You're welcome. We're best friends, after all." [[4038 陈倩 neutral]]
She got out of bed and washed up. [[4039 旁白 neutral]]
After quickly getting ready, Su Tao walked to the dorm corridor. [[4040 旁白 neutral]]
Looking up at the sky, for some reason, the uneasiness in her heart subtly grew. [[4041 旁白 neutral]]
The sky was overcast today, and there might be heavy rain. [[4042 旁白 neutral]]
