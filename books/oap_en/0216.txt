Chapter 216: She always called me Taotao [[18787 旁白 neutral]]
A surprise is called a surprise because it happens suddenly, leaving no time to prepare. [[18788 旁白 neutral]]
The elevator was fast going from the 1st to the 8th floor, but for Su Tao, it felt so long. [[18789 旁白 neutral]]
She paced back and forth, circling the center of the elevator. Her boots, covering her small feet, made a tapping sound on the floor. [[18790 旁白 neutral]]
Her clenched fists were getting a little sweaty from nervousness and anticipation. [[18791 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't prepared for Chi Xiaocheng to wake up at this moment. [[18792 旁白 neutral]]
Even though Professor Su had said that, given Xiaocheng's condition, she might wake up in the next couple of days. [[18793 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao subconsciously thought this was just Professor Su's way of comforting her. She understood how much hope could affect a person, so she was very grateful to Professor Su. [[18794 旁白 neutral]]
Holding on to that tiny bit of possibility, she had been picking out a gift online. [[18795 旁白 neutral]]
The gift wasn't chosen yet. She was just making her daily visit to the hospital to see her Xiaocheng, but unexpectedly, a surprise was hidden in this ordinary routine. [[18796 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao stopped walking and watched the elevator go up, floor by floor. [[18797 旁白 neutral]]
From the 5th floor to the 6th, and after a long wait, the number changed to 7. [[18798 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took a quick deep breath. Thinking about a decision she had made, her heart started to beat uncontrollably fast. [[18799 旁白 neutral]]
"Confession, confession, confession..." [[18800 苏桃 neutral]]
"What should I say in a confession? Is it enough to just say I like her?" [[18801 苏桃 neutral]]
"What about making it special? But Xiaocheng must be very weak after just waking up. Should I show my concern for her first, or confess first?" [[18802 苏桃 neutral]]
"What kind of expression will she have then? Will it be relief and happiness? But she'll definitely be very happy, right? After all, she has always hoped that I would like her." [[18803 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao mumbled to herself very quickly. With a "ding," the elevator arrived. As the doors slowly opened, Su Tao bolted out. [[18804 旁白 neutral]]
Room 806, straight to the end and the first room around the corner! [[18805 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, she even forgot she was in a hospital and that her long strides might disturb other patients' rest. [[18806 旁白 neutral]]
Until a young nurse stopped Su Tao and made a "shh" gesture at her. "Ma'am, please be a little quieter. The patients on this floor are in critical condition and need a lot of rest." [[18807 小护士 neutral]]
"Sorry, sorry!" [[18808 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly apologized and slowed her pace. [[18809 旁白 neutral]]
She really wanted to see Chi Xiaocheng, and she really wanted to hear her affectionately and happily call her "Taotao." [[18810 旁白 happy]]
Before she reached the corner, she saw Professor Su walking over hurriedly, looking a little unwell. [[18811 旁白 neutral]]
She saw Su Tao and paused for a moment. "Miss Su, you're here so early today?" [[18812 苏教授 neutral]]
"The cafe started its annual holiday today, so I have nothing to do. I came to keep Xiaocheng company. I heard she woke up, is that right?" [[18813 苏桃 happy]]
Hearing this, Professor Su pressed her lips together and nodded lightly. "She's awake, but other nurses are changing her dressings and checking the equipment right now. You should wait a little while before you go over." [[18814 苏教授 neutral]]
"Oh, I see... Okay!" [[18815 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao nodded eagerly, her face full of anticipation. She didn't notice Professor Su's hesitant expression. [[18816 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su sighed softly. "You can go in after the nurses come out. But please be mentally prepared. Although she's awake, the situation is not good. Try not to upset her." [[18817 苏教授 sad]]
"Okay." [[18818 苏桃 neutral]]
Watching Professor Su hurry away, Su Tao looked a little confused. [[18819 旁白 neutral]]
Waking up is the best news, so why would she say the situation is not good? [[18820 旁白 neutral]]
If it was because her body had gotten weaker after lying in bed for a whole month, Su Tao could understand. [[18821 旁白 neutral]]
But that wasn't a problem. She would take care of Xiaocheng! [[18822 旁白 neutral]]
She tried to calm her impatient heart and waited. [[18823 旁白 neutral]]
Before long, her phone rang, interrupting her excited mood. [[18824 旁白 neutral]]
She recognized the phone number and, feeling relieved, walked over to a balcony where she wouldn't disturb other patients. [[18825 旁白 neutral]]
She answered the call. [[18826 旁白 neutral]]
A kind, elderly voice spoke first. "Is that Xiaotao? Am I disturbing you by calling at this time?" [[18827 池母 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled and said in a relaxed tone, "Don't worry, Auntie, you're not disturbing me. It's winter break, and I have nothing to do. How could you possibly disturb me?" [[18828 苏桃 happy]]
The caller was Chi Xiaocheng's mother, the elder who had raised Su Tao. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call her a second mother. [[18829 旁白 neutral]]
Although Chi's mother's voice was kind, it held a trace of worry. "Xiaotao, the reason I'm calling is that I can't reach Xiaocheng. I haven't heard from her in a while, so I wanted to ask if you two had a fight. I haven't heard from her for so long." [[18830 池母 sad]]
The familiar question made Su Tao pause for a moment. [[18831 旁白 neutral]]
She remembered receiving a similar call when she was dealing with the yandere Chi Xiaocheng. [[18832 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, Chi Xiaocheng was also in the hospital, seriously injured, and her condition was unknown. [[18833 旁白 neutral]]
She had told a lie, lacking confidence, and didn't dare to face Chi's mother directly. [[18834 旁白 sad]]
But things were different now. Thinking about the fact that Chi Xiaocheng had woken up, Su Tao smiled and said, "Auntie, don't worry, how could we possibly fight? Xiaocheng is very attached to me. She always calls me 'Taotao' affectionately." [[18835 苏桃 happy]]
"She's in the hospital for health reasons. The doctor said she can't use her phone, so it's at home." [[18836 苏桃 neutral]]
"That's good." Chi's mother sighed in relief and sounded more relaxed. "So, are you two coming home for the New Year?" [[18837 池母 happy]]
"Well..." Su Tao hesitated. "I need to check with the doctor about Xiaocheng's condition. If there's no problem, we will definitely come back for the New Year." [[18838 苏桃 neutral]]
"How about this? In a couple of days, Xiaocheng and I will give you a video call." [[18839 苏桃 happy]]
"Great, great! It's been so long. The old man and I miss you two!" [[18840 池母 happy]]
The conversation was full of everyday chatter, but it was filled with hope for the future. This time, Su Tao didn't run away. [[18841 旁白 happy]]
Xiaocheng was awake. If she was physically fine, she would take her home for the New Year. [[18842 旁白 happy]]
After confessing, she would go home and truly tell her aunt and uncle. [[18843 旁白 happy]]
She wanted to take care of Xiaocheng for the rest of her life! [[18844 旁白 happy]]
And then prove to them that she had the ability to do so! [[18845 旁白 happy]]
As they chatted, a nurse slowly came out of Chi Xiaocheng's room. [[18846 旁白 neutral]]
Pushing a cart full of equipment, her expression was happy about Chi Xiaocheng's recovery. [[18847 旁白 happy]]
While politely ending the call with Chi's mother, Su Tao quickly walked to the door of the hospital room. [[18848 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the room, the girl she had been longing for was sitting on the bed. Her small frame was hidden in a blue and white hospital gown. [[18849 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's hands were folded in her lap, and she was looking out the window at the birds flying by. [[18850 旁白 neutral]]
The morning sun and gentle breeze favored this delicate girl. Like a soft hand, the breeze moved the pure white curtains and also her smooth, shiny, brown hair. [[18851 旁白 neutral]]
With only a side view of her face visible, she looked so beautiful at that moment. [[18852 旁白 happy]]
The excitement and thrill in Su Tao's heart slowly calmed down. [[18853 旁白 happy]]
Surprise and anxiety turned into happiness, and tears threatened to well up in her eyes. [[18854 旁白 happy]]
All her emotions finally melted into the gentlest gaze. [[18855 旁白 happy]]
The scene before her was not a dream. [[18856 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao took a deep breath and knocked lightly on the doorframe, getting Chi Xiaocheng's attention. [[18857 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng..." [[18858 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao was about to speak, but Chi Xiaocheng on the bed spoke first. [[18859 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled with a relaxed, dependent look. "Sister Su Tao, you're here." [[18860 池小橙 happy]]
Her words made Su Tao stop in her tracks. [[18861 旁白 sad]]
Sister... Su Tao? [[18862 旁白 sad]]
Shouldn't it be Taotao? [[18863 旁白 sad]]
