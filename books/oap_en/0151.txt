Chapter 151: This time, I can't listen to you. [[13333 旁白 neutral]]
Shards of glass danced in the air, and blood bloomed like a flower. Everything around Su Tao seemed to slow down. [[13334 旁白 neutral]]
The glass hit the floor with a harsh clatter, and the sound of the gunshot still seemed to echo in the air. Screams erupted from all over the apartment complex. [[13335 旁白 neutral]]
A large hole was blown through the glass door. Cracks spread out from the center of the bullet hole like a spiderweb. [[13336 旁白 neutral]]
A flying piece of glass grazed Su Tao's cheek, leaving a cut, but she didn't feel any pain. Her pupils, narrowed from the intense shock, reflected only terror and disbelief. [[13337 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey... Xiaocheng... This isn't real, is it? Are... are you okay?" [[13338 苏桃 sad]]
As she spoke with a trembling voice, her mind went blank. She didn't even think to pull Chi Xiaocheng further into the living room to safety. [[13339 旁白 neutral]]
She was on the floor only because Chi Xiaocheng had tackled her, her hands braced against the ground and her knees supporting Chi Xiaocheng's waist. [[13340 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out to hold Chi Xiaocheng, but her hand was trembling too much to touch her shoulder. [[13341 旁白 neutral]]
What was going on? [[13342 苏桃 sad]]
What in the world had just happened? [[13343 苏桃 sad]]
Why was there a gun? Was it an assassination? [[13344 苏桃 sad]]
I was the one who should have been shot, so why did Xiaocheng push me out of the way? [[13345 苏桃 sad]]
What was I supposed to do now? [[13346 苏桃 sad]]
And Xiaocheng… why aren't you talking? [[13347 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's shoulder trembled slightly, and Su Tao snapped back to her senses, grabbing her shoulders. [[13348 旁白 neutral]]
A flicker of relief crossed her face as she helped Chi Xiaocheng sit up. "Xiaocheng, are you okay?" [[13349 苏桃 happy]]
But how could she be okay after taking a bullet for her? [[13350 旁白 sad]]
As Su Tao helped Chi Xiaocheng up, she felt a large wet patch on her own clothes. A dark red hole, somewhere near her heart, was gushing blood like a broken faucet. [[13351 旁白 neutral]]
Her relief turned into a stunned, unspeakable horror. She quickly pressed her hand to the wound. [[13352 旁白 sad]]
But blood kept seeping out from the edges of her palm and between her fingers. [[13353 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng... Xiaocheng, hang in there! I... I'll call Dongfang Yang right now, I'll have him get a doctor!" [[13354 苏桃 sad]]
With her hair in a mess, Su Tao frantically searched for her phone, but she couldn't find it in any of her pockets. [[13355 旁白 neutral]]
Downstairs, the security guard's voice echoed through the complex, telling residents to stay calm and hide away from the windows, warning them not to go outside. [[13356 旁白 neutral]]
The complex's security team had already reached the door to Chi Xiaocheng's apartment. They were ringing the doorbell repeatedly while shouting from outside, waiting for property management to bring a spare key card. [[13357 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao couldn't hear the doorbell. With one hand over the wound and the other caressing Chi Xiaocheng's face, she held her up and kept murmuring, "Hang in there." [[13358 旁白 sad]]
A small hand suddenly grabbed Su Tao's wrist with surprising strength. Chi Xiaocheng struggled to open her eyes. [[13359 旁白 neutral]]
Her face was rapidly growing pale and gaunt as her life slipped away. [[13360 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, Chi Xiaocheng managed to force a smile. [[13361 旁白 happy]]
"Taotao~" [[13362 池小橙 happy]]
She whispered the name that filled her heart. In her final moments, there was no trace of her usual possessiveness, as if their earlier argument had never happened. [[13363 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice was so weak that Su Tao had to lean in close to hear her. [[13364 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao squeezed Chi Xiaocheng's hand tightly, tears streaming down her face. "Xiaocheng, don't talk. Just hold on and don't fall asleep. The doctor will be here soon. You'll be saved, just like last time." [[13365 苏桃 sad]]
"Taotao..." [[13366 池小橙 sad]]
She called her name again, trying to lean closer to Su Tao's ear, but she didn't have the strength to even lift her head. Speaking and breathing had become incredibly difficult. [[13367 旁白 neutral]]
Ah, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts so much... [[13368 池小橙 sad]]
Even with the skill that reduced pain, it was still agonizing. [[13369 旁白 neutral]]
But... I don't feel bad at all. [[13370 池小橙 happy]]
The body holding me is so warm, completely different from the cold I felt in the bathtub last time. [[13371 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng forced a smile. "Taotao, you... you have to listen to me." [[13372 池小橙 sad]]
She was growing weaker, as if trying to say her last words. [[13373 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao just kept shaking her head, tears falling. "Don't talk. I won't listen. Whatever you have to say, you can tell me after you get better. You can talk as much as you want then!" [[13374 苏桃 sad]]
"You're asking for the impossible~" [[13375 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng chuckled softly, then let out a dry cough. [[13376 旁白 neutral]]
She could feel her body growing cold. [[13377 旁白 neutral]]
If she didn't say what she needed to say now, she might never get another chance. [[13378 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng gathered her remaining strength and weakly reached up to wipe away Su Tao's tears. "Taotao... I was never mad at you... I'm sorry for putting so much pressure on you..." [[13379 池小橙 sad]]
"Stop talking, just stop talking!" [[13380 苏桃 sad]]
"If I don't say it now... I'm afraid I won't get another chance. I..." [[13381 池小橙 sad]]
"No... no!" Su Tao gripped Chi Xiaocheng's hand tighter, shaking her head forcefully. [[13382 苏桃 sad]]
She didn't want to hear it. She didn't want to hear any of it! [[13383 旁白 sad]]
Last words. [[13384 旁白 sad]]
Goodbyes. [[13385 旁白 sad]]
Instructions for the future. [[13386 旁白 sad]]
She refused to accept any of it. Say whatever you want after you've recovered. I want to hear it when you're standing in front of me, healthy again! [[13387 旁白 sad]]
With a "beep," the front door opened, and the security guards rushed in. The one in the lead shouted, "Is everyone in 502 okay?" [[13388 旁白 neutral]]
The security chief scanned the room and spotted Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng, partially hidden by the counter. He walked toward them, relieved. "That's great, it looks like you're okay. I..." [[13389 保安队长 neutral]]
"Shut up—!" [[13390 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao looked up and screamed at the security chief. [[13391 旁白 neutral]]
Tears streamed down her chin. Beneath her messy bangs, her eyes were bloodshot, and the tears themselves seemed to be streaked with thin lines of red. [[13392 旁白 neutral]]
The security chief froze. As he got closer, he saw that Chi Xiaocheng, who had been hidden by the counter, was lying in the girl's arms. [[13393 旁白 neutral]]
The rug beneath them was soaked red, like a blooming rose. [[13394 旁白 neutral]]
He paused for a moment, then nodded to the other guards, signaling them to secure the other rooms. [[13395 旁白 neutral]]
He took out his phone and stepped back outside. [[13396 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had already lowered her head again, her heart aching as she watched the life fade from Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[13397 旁白 sad]]
She wanted to do something. [[13398 旁白 sad]]
But she realized there was nothing she could do. [[13399 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng repeated her words again, "Taotao, you... you have to listen to me." [[13400 池小橙 sad]]
"I won't listen! If you say another word, I'll leave you!" [[13401 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao kept shaking her head, refusing, trying to snatch her Xiaocheng back from the hands of death. [[13402 旁白 sad]]
Usually, whenever she said that, Chi Xiaocheng would quiet down and obey. [[13403 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, she had a reason she had to speak. [[13404 旁白 neutral]]
She managed a faint, sweet smile. "That's so mean. But I'm sorry. Just this once... I can't listen to you." [[13405 池小橙 sad]]
