Chapter 174: You Only Deserve to Regret [[15182 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't know where Chengcheng's confidence came from, but she met her firm and confident eyes. [[15183 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but show a faint smile. "Alright, I'll listen to you. I'll believe that a miracle will happen." [[15184 苏桃 happy]]
Anyway, she was just agreeing for the sake of it. [[15185 旁白 neutral]]
How could a dead person come back to life? [[15186 旁白 neutral]]
Since they were out to relax, she shouldn't keep venting her negative emotions to Chengcheng. [[15187 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng took a big sip of her coffee, finishing the whole glass of Orange C. Then she stood up and said, "Let's go. We don't have much time, and it's boring to just sit in this cafe. The sun is so nice, let's go for a walk." [[15188 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao stood up with her, confused. "Going for a walk is fine, but... what do you mean we don't have much time?" [[15189 苏桃 neutral]]
"Didn't I tell you?" Chengcheng picked up Da Wang and placed him on her shoulder. "I snuck out. I've been doing research recently and often have to isolate myself, so my advisor gave me a three-hour break." [[15190 程程 neutral]]
As she spoke, she glanced down at her phone. "Let's walk around for another hour and a half, then I have to go back early." [[15191 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao: "What kind of research are you doing, senior?" [[15192 苏桃 neutral]]
"Um..." Chengcheng replied lightly, "Astronomy. You wouldn't understand even if I told you." [[15193 程程 neutral]]
"So, where should we go next?" [[15194 苏桃 neutral]]
"Hmm... let's go to your university. It's still lively before the holiday starts. I've never been to Jiuzhou University." [[15195 程程 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao went to the door first, pushed it open, and held it until Chengcheng went out before closing it. "If we're going to the university, should we take a taxi? It's a half-hour walk." [[15196 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's okay, let's just walk." [[15197 程程 neutral]]
They chatted casually on the way, but they had already talked a lot during the hour at the cafe. [[15198 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was usually quite talkative, but since Chi Xiaocheng left, she had become a bit quiet. [[15199 旁白 sad]]
The conversation wandered, but eventually, it came back to Chi Xiaocheng. [[15200 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng was walking slightly ahead and asked, "Taozi, if your Xiaocheng could wake up, what's the first thing you would want to say to her?" [[15201 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao touched her chin and thought for a moment. "Probably... an apology." [[15202 苏桃 sad]]
"You seem to have high emotional intelligence when we chat, so how can you be so dense when it comes to feelings?" [[15203 程程 neutral]]
Chengcheng jumped over a small pit of snow and looked back at Su Tao. "She definitely wouldn't be happy if you apologized. The best thing to do is to give her what she wants most the moment she wakes up." [[15204 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao: "What she wants most?" [[15205 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes. You have to remember, she took a bullet for you because she likes you, worries about you, and didn't want you to get hurt. She wants you to live and have a better life." [[15206 程程 neutral]]
"Not for you to be depressed all the time. If she woke up to see you looking miserable and apologizing, anyone would feel that saving you wasn't worth it, right?" [[15207 程程 angry]]
Every word from Chengcheng seemed to strike a chord in Su Tao's heart. [[15208 旁白 neutral]]
What did Xiaocheng want in her last moments? [[15209 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's memory went back to the moment they parted. [[15210 旁白 sad]]
Two words suddenly appeared in her mind. [[15211 旁白 neutral]]
Confession. [[15212 旁白 neutral]]
She stopped walking. "Chengcheng, do you mean... I should confess to her when she wakes up?" [[15213 苏桃 neutral]]
Chengcheng turned back and continued walking, a slight smile on her lips. "I wouldn't know about that. Only you know what she's missing or what she likes. But this is all hypothetical, of course." [[15214 程程 happy]]
She said it lightly, but Su Tao's eyes became serious. "If she really can wake up, I will definitely confess!" [[15215 苏桃 happy]]
This time, it won't be just saying "I like you." [[15216 旁白 neutral]]
Nor will it be words like "I love you." [[15217 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, I will declare it to you: we will become a couple, and you will be my girlfriend! [[15218 旁白 happy]]
"But, in the end, this is just a hypothetical situation." [[15219 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao sighed again. Regret haunted her every moment. [[15220 旁白 sad]]
How she wished Chi Xiaocheng could have heard her confession in that final moment. [[15221 旁白 sad]]
However, Chengcheng, who had been walking ahead, suddenly turned her head to look at Su Tao. [[15222 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was startled. "Senior, what are you doing?" [[15223 苏桃 neutral]]
Chengcheng pushed up her black-framed glasses, as if confirming something. [[15224 旁白 neutral]]
After Su Tao held her breath for a long time, she asked very seriously, "Your Xiaocheng was willing to die for you, and you still haven't confessed to her?" [[15225 程程 angry]]
"I..." Su Tao was at a loss for words. [[15226 苏桃 sad]]
Then she lowered her head. "It's my fault. I was always... always a little afraid of Xiaocheng's yandere side." [[15227 苏桃 sad]]
Chengcheng: "And?" [[15228 程程 angry]]
"And... also, I thought that two girls... it's a bit... strange." [[15229 苏桃 sad]]
Her mindset hadn't completely changed yet. [[15230 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng, who was in front, turned around unhappily. "Since you've been so hesitant, you really only deserve to regret like this. You should be glad that your Xiaocheng has always loved you." [[15231 程程 angry]]
"If one day she's really stolen away by someone else, it'll be too late for regrets." [[15232 程程 angry]]
"Besides, even if she could wake up, a false confession like that would be compensation, not like and love." [[15233 程程 angry]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and said stubbornly, "But what's the use of saying all this? Xiaocheng isn't going to wake up." [[15234 苏桃 sad]]
She had never gone to the hospital. [[15235 旁白 sad]]
She didn't dare to face Chi Xiaocheng's body. [[15236 旁白 sad]]
It had been over a week now. Although Dongfang Yang hadn't given her any news, it was probably just a matter of choosing an auspicious day for the cremation. [[15237 旁白 sad]]
The originally harmonious relationship between the two seemed to have become a little awkward because of this topic. [[15238 旁白 neutral]]
This continued until they reached the gate of Jiuzhou University. Chengcheng looked up and exclaimed, "As expected of a top university in the country, this gate is so impressive." [[15239 程程 happy]]
Su Tao looked at Chengcheng strangely. "Senior, your university is the impressive one. It's recognized as the best in Jiuzhou City." [[15240 苏桃 neutral]]
"Ahem, you always want what you can't have. You just don't get it." [[15241 程程 neutral]]
Seeing many students leaving with their luggage, Chengcheng couldn't help but ask, "Where are you planning to go next?" [[15242 程程 neutral]]
"I..." Su Tao hesitated, then saw a familiar figure walking over with a suitcase. "Yo, Taozi, I haven't seen you for a week. How have you been?" [[15243 黎染 happy]]
The person who came was Li Ran, a classmate she worked with part-time. [[15244 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lied, "I've been busy lately. Are you going home?" [[15245 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yeah, there's nothing to do after the exams. I just got my salary yesterday and earned my credits, so I quit my job at the supermarket." [[15246 黎染 happy]]
Li Ran came up to Su Tao. "Most of the part-timers have already quit. There are only one or two people left at the supermarket. You've been on leave for a week, it's amazing the new manager approved such a long leave for you." [[15247 黎染 neutral]]
Hearing Li Ran say this, Su Tao finally remembered. [[15248 旁白 neutral]]
Since Sister Long was injured by Xiaocheng, the supermarket had a new manager. [[15249 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't in a good state at that time, so Dongfang Yang helped her ask for a week off. [[15250 旁白 neutral]]
If she hadn't seen Li Ran, she would have forgotten about it. [[15251 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Su Tao felt a little scared again. [[15252 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng was great in every way, except for her yandere side, which she didn't like. [[15253 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng's extremism not only sent Sister Long to the hospital, but also injured her own advisor. [[15254 旁白 sad]]
Although Sister Long was a bit harsh, it was just a small conflict. It was still a human life! [[15255 旁白 sad]]
Not to mention, her advisor had been very good to her, guiding and training her since the beginning of the semester. [[15256 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and asked, "How is... Sister Long?" [[15257 苏桃 sad]]
Li Ran said lightly, "She's in the hospital. She lost an arm, is permanently blind in both eyes, and seems to have other injuries. She'll probably be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life." [[15258 黎染 neutral]]
As she spoke, she smiled happily. "Taozi, your Xiaocheng did a great thing. She really deserved it!" [[15259 黎染 happy]]
Hearing this, Su Tao was stunned. "Deserved it?" [[15260 苏桃 neutral]]
