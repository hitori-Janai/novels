Chapter 127: Su Tao's Lucid Dream [[11180 旁白 neutral]]
The figure was the same one Chi Xiaocheng had seen before, and after a moment of disorientation, she was captivated by its exquisite quality and striking visual contrast. [[11181 旁白 neutral]]
In the figure, she wore a black formal dress, staring at Chi Xiaocheng with a demonic, terrifying smile, as if about to drink her "orange juice." [[11182 旁白 neutral]]
The switch from black to white was like a reversal of their roles in real life. [[11183 旁白 neutral]]
She was the aggressor. [[11184 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, in her pure white princess dress, was the victim. [[11185 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stared at the figure, her lips trembling. "Does Xiaocheng... also think I'm the one who hurt her?" [[11186 苏桃 sad]]
She rubbed her eyes, unable to look at the figure any longer. She curled up under the covers, hugging the large brown teddy bear tightly. [[11187 旁白 neutral]]
She pretended the big brown bear was Chi Xiaocheng, burying her face in its fluffy fur and greedily breathing in the scent Chi Xiaocheng had left behind. [[11188 旁白 sad]]
*If only Xiaocheng were here,* she thought. [[11189 旁白 sad]]
This thought lingered in her mind as she drifted off to sleep. [[11190 旁白 neutral]]
But when she opened her eyes again, she was faced with a scene that pained her deeply. [[11191 旁白 sad]]
"Why? Why would you rather go with Ye Liang than take me with you? Do you dislike me that much?" [[11192 池小橙 sad]]
The person she missed so much was standing before her in tears, pointing at Ye Liang with eyes full of bitterness and sorrow. [[11193 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao knew this scene all too well. It was the day she and Xiaocheng argued during their high school summer break. [[11194 旁白 neutral]]
At the time, she was on good terms with Ye Liang and had accepted his help. As payback, he asked her to go with him to a matchmaking party to help him fend off a girl from another family he was being set up with. [[11195 旁白 neutral]]
She had agreed, wanting to repay Ye Liang for his help. [[11196 旁白 neutral]]
That way, she would have no further ties or troubles with the young master. [[11197 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng refused to listen to her explanation, and the two of them ended up fighting. [[11198 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was an adult now, and Su Tao wanted her to be more independent. She wasn't angry at first, but with Ye Liang there, she found herself saying some very harsh things to Chi Xiaocheng for no reason. [[11199 旁白 neutral]]
That argument was the fuse that lit a series of events that followed. [[11200 旁白 neutral]]
"But why am I back here?" [[11201 苏桃 neutral]]
"Is this a dream?" [[11202 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked down at her transparent hands and realized she was merely an observer, watching the memory play out again. [[11203 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, the Su Tao in the dream retorted loudly, "Can you stop being so unreasonable? It's been so long, yet you're still so immature. Xiaocheng, you need to find your own hobbies and things to do!" [[11204 苏桃 angry]]
People often don't choose their words carefully when they are irritated and angry. [[11205 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao knew this, but what stunned her was the realization that followed. [[11206 旁白 neutral]]
"Were my words really that harsh?" [[11207 苏桃 sad]]
"I don't remember it at all." [[11208 苏桃 neutral]]
The argument grew more intense, and Chi Xiaocheng left in tears. [[11209 旁白 sad]]
She belatedly realized she should chase after her, but Ye Liang held her back. [[11210 旁白 neutral]]
*I'll find time to talk to Xiaocheng and apologize later,* she thought. [[11211 旁白 neutral]]
The observing Su Tao found herself thinking the same thing as her dream-self. [[11212 旁白 neutral]]
Because back then, that was exactly what she had thought. [[11213 旁白 neutral]]
"But is this dream just meant to make me watch things that have already happened?" [[11214 苏桃 neutral]]
"Am I dreaming this because I regret it so much?" [[11215 苏桃 sad]]
"Is this my punishment? To relive the pain of losing her all over again?" [[11216 苏桃 sad]]
Since no one could see her in her transparent state, Su Tao decided to follow the direction Chi Xiaocheng had gone. [[11217 旁白 neutral]]
There was no need to follow her own past. She was more interested in what Chi Xiaocheng did after their fight. [[11218 旁白 neutral]]
Why did she become so strange, so yandere, so paranoid? [[11219 苏桃 neutral]]
And why did she fall for people like Ye Liang in such a short time, and constantly oppose me? [[11220 苏桃 neutral]]
She followed Chi Xiaocheng back to her home and watched as the younger girl threw herself onto her bed, crying. The sound of her sobs tore at Su Tao's heart. [[11221 旁白 sad]]
To Su Tao's surprise, Chi Xiaocheng spent the next few days trying to find her. [[11222 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao was always too busy to see her. [[11223 旁白 neutral]]
The appearance of Ye Liang, Dongfang Yang, and Si Chen had gradually thrown her own life into disarray. [[11224 旁白 neutral]]
Because of all their small problems, her life had become busy and full. But from Chi Xiaocheng's more extreme perspective, it meant one thing. [[11225 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't want her anymore. [[11226 旁白 sad]]
The two of them barely spoke again until the school term began. [[11227 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng seemed to be acting abnormally. She would sometimes wake up muttering that Ye Liang was dangerous. [[11228 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed to be having one nightmare after another, believing the Ye Liang from her dreams would hurt Su Tao and treating these dreams as reality. [[11229 旁白 neutral]]
But with no other friends to talk to, she had no one to turn to. [[11230 旁白 sad]]
Finally, after university started, she met her two roommates, including Zeng Xiu Hua. [[11231 旁白 neutral]]
Faced with her roommates' friendly smiles, the lonely Chi Xiaocheng naively trusted them and told them everything. [[11232 旁白 neutral]]
Her favorite person, Su Tao. [[11233 池小橙 sad]]
But it felt like she didn't want her anymore. [[11234 池小橙 sad]]
The terrifying Ye Liang from her dreams. [[11235 池小橙 sad]]
If she didn't stop him, Su Tao would definitely get hurt. [[11236 池小橙 sad]]
To the observing Su Tao, these words sounded like the beginning of a split personality. [[11237 旁白 neutral]]
But Zeng Xiu Hua was not a good person. She deceived Chi Xiaocheng while manipulating her, saying, "Since you can't win Su Tao back, why don't you just steal Ye Liang from her?" [[11238 曾秀花 neutral]]
"Steal him away?" [[11239 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng asked, confused. [[11240 旁白 neutral]]
Zeng Xiu Hua nodded. "That's right. You're so cute. I'll put a little makeup on you, and I guarantee Ye Liang will be head over heels for you. If you steal him away from Su Tao, won't you be protecting her?" [[11241 曾秀花 neutral]]
Those manipulative words stuck in Chi Xiaocheng's mind. [[11242 旁白 neutral]]
The white swan, deceived by a toad, willingly steeped herself in murky water and became an ugly, despised duckling. [[11243 旁白 sad]]
But with the toad's praise, the ugly duckling believed that she was at her most beautiful and lovely. [[11244 旁白 sad]]
"Xiu Hua, that Chi Xiaocheng is so naive. It'll be a miracle if she can win over Ye Liang with that clownish makeup on her face." [[11245 陌生女1 neutral]]
"Isn't it fun, though? I just want to see her expression when Ye Liang rejects her. Hahaha! Who cares if she's pretty? She has no brain. A few nice words and she does whatever you say. We should thank that Su Tao for making Chi Xiaocheng so obedient." [[11246 曾秀花 happy]]
Hearing Zeng Xiu Hua and the other roommate mock Chi Xiaocheng behind her back made Su Tao burn with rage. [[11247 旁白 angry]]
But as a mere observer in a memory, she could do nothing. [[11248 旁白 sad]]
She already knew exactly what would happen next. [[11249 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng would pursue Ye Liang, Dongfang Yang, and even Si Chen. [[11250 旁白 neutral]]
And she would be rejected, time and time again. [[11251 旁白 neutral]]
She would constantly interfere in Su Tao's life, making Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang's opinion of her worsen. [[11252 旁白 neutral]]
And the distance between her and Su Tao would grow ever wider. [[11253 旁白 sad]]
—Yes, that's what was supposed to have happened in reality. [[11254 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao kept following Chi Xiaocheng, wondering when the dream would finally end. [[11255 旁白 neutral]]
However, what happened next was something Su Tao never expected. [[11256 旁白 neutral]]
At dusk, Chi Xiaocheng confessed her feelings to Ye Liang for the first time. [[11257 旁白 neutral]]
Holding a bundle of wildflowers she had picked from who-knows-where, she confessed, "Ye Liang, I like you. Can you leave Su Tao and be with me?" [[11258 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao didn't even have to guess; she knew Ye Liang would refuse. [[11259 旁白 neutral]]
After all, in her memory, Ye Liang had told her about this confession. [[11260 旁白 neutral]]
But to her complete astonishment, Ye Liang broke into a strange, almost terrifying grin. "Alright," he said, "I accept!" [[11261 叶良 happy]]
