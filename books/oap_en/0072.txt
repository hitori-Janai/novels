Chapter 72 First Heartbeat [[6290 旁白 neutral]]
Her heart beat a little faster, her pores opened. The biting cold wind did not make her shiver; instead, it dispelled a hint of warmth in her heart. [[6291 旁白 neutral]]
Both mentally and physically, she was relaxed, enjoying this moment. [[6292 旁白 neutral]]
What was this feeling? [[6293 旁白 neutral]]
Was it a heartbeat? [[6294 旁白 neutral]]
Her smile, her small face, her delicate nose, her small mouth, her hair, all so cute. [[6295 旁白 neutral]]
But I myself am a girl, and I'm actually... having a heartbeat for another girl? [[6296 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked away. This was purely a subconscious self-protection. [[6297 旁白 neutral]]
No, perhaps it was because Xiaocheng's actions reminded me of things from my childhood. [[6298 旁白 neutral]]
Falling into memories and a trance, that's why I'm reacting like this. [[6299 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Chi Xiaocheng's voice suddenly sounded in her ear, "Do you like it?" [[6300 池小橙 neutral]]
"What?" [[6301 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao paused, then became flustered again. [[6302 旁白 neutral]]
What did Xiaocheng mean? [[6303 旁白 neutral]]
Does she like her? [[6304 旁白 neutral]]
Not just this time, she had asked several times before. [[6305 旁白 neutral]]
Would she demand an answer? What if she showed her yandere side again? [[6306 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind raced. Chi Xiaocheng's voice sounded again, "Steamed bun, Tao Tao, do you like it?" [[6307 池小橙 neutral]]
What? So she was asking about the steamed bun. [[6308 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly nodded, "Mm-hmm, I like it." [[6309 苏桃 neutral]]
"Is that so? As long as Tao Tao likes it~" [[6310 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled back and walked forward again. [[6311 旁白 neutral]]
Her strange tone, slightly elongated ending, Chi Xiaocheng's actions always left Su Tao a little puzzled. [[6312 旁白 neutral]]
She was just talking about steamed buns, what did she mean by that? [[6313 旁白 neutral]]
Following Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao's gaze was on Chi Xiaocheng. After walking a few steps, she suddenly paused. [[6314 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze lingered on her chest for a few seconds, then quickly moved away. [[6315 旁白 neutral]]
Her steps became hurried. [[6316 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't know how much Su Tao was thinking. She was very happy right now. [[6317 旁白 neutral]]
Only because the system had just sent a notification she had been waiting for. [[6318 旁白 neutral]]
[Detected female lead Su Tao experiencing a heartbeat emotion towards the host.] [[6319 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion points +100...] [[6320 系统 neutral]]
Since it was the first time such an emotion had occurred, the emotion points gained were undoubtedly a huge sum. [[6321 旁白 neutral]]
And it was worth her half a month of effort. She had finally made Tao Tao change her mind! [[6322 旁白 neutral]]
If she could deal with Ye Liang next, she would have even more time. [[6323 旁白 neutral]]
But for the current Tao Tao, such a date could only be a seasoning. [[6324 旁白 neutral]]
She had to do something drastic. [[6325 旁白 neutral]]
At least, she had to put more pressure on her, like that night on the rooftop, or in the dark room. [[6326 旁白 neutral]]
—What should she do? [[6327 旁白 neutral]]
They didn't chat along the way as before. Both had their own thoughts, and soon arrived at the Moonlight Cafe. [[6328 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps the cafe's air conditioning was constantly on. Compared to its usual desertedness, it finally had several customers. [[6329 旁白 neutral]]
Butler Chu saw the two approaching and greeted them with a smile, "Miss Chi, Miss Su, what coffee would you like to drink?" [[6330 褚三 neutral]]
"Coffee starting at 100 yuan, I can't afford it." Chi Xiaocheng shivered, squinting at the air conditioner blowing warm air. [[6331 池小橙 neutral]]
Shopping in winter was indeed a suffering. [[6332 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a clear voice sounded in her ear, "I'll treat you to coffee, but Chi Xiaocheng, aren't you too lazy? You're supposed to be watching the cafe, but you've skipped work three out of five days." [[6333 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang walked down from the second floor of the cafe, his arms crossed, pretending to be displeased as he looked at Chi Xiaocheng. [[6334 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng saw Dongfang Yang. Her intermediate acting skills made her restrain a hint of the dependence she showed towards Su Tao, and instead, she timidly replied, "I was sick those few days. If you don't believe me, ask Tao Tao. She was taking care of me." [[6335 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's smile stiffened. [[6336 旁白 neutral]]
These days she skipped work, wasn't it in the dark room? [[6337 旁白 neutral]]
"Is that so, Su Tao?" [[6338 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't dare to meet Dongfang Yang's gaze and nodded slightly, "Mm... Xiaocheng... has always been a bit frail." [[6339 苏桃 neutral]]
She wasn't good at lying. If it were Si Chen, he could easily tell Su Tao was hiding something by paying attention to her micro-expressions. [[6340 旁白 neutral]]
Then Dongfang Yang just looked at Chi Xiaocheng helplessly, not suspecting Su Tao's cover-up at all, "Although it's the same whether you're at the cafe or not, next time you need to take time off, remember to report to Butler Chu in advance, understood?" [[6341 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded like a pecking chick, then cautiously asked, "Boss, are you concerned about me?" [[6342 池小橙 neutral]]
"Huh?" Dongfang Yang's tone was mocking, "I'm just afraid that if something really happens to you, you'll turn around and extort me. People who don't know might think I'm a black-hearted boss." [[6343 东方阳 neutral]]
At these words, both Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao looked at him strangely. [[6344 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's face froze, a little awkward, "W-why are you looking at me like that? I'm just telling the truth." [[6345 东方阳 neutral]]
He quickly changed the subject, "I heard Ye Liang is bullying you two?" [[6346 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao gently shook her head, "Not really, just a small spat with him." [[6347 苏桃 neutral]]
"He's bullying me!" Chi Xiaocheng mustered her courage, looking like she was complaining to her parents, "Boss, you don't know, Ye Liang actually said he wanted to snatch Tao Tao away. I... I wish I could beat him to death!" [[6348 池小橙 angry]]
A hint of bloodlust flashed in her eyes. Her intermediate acting skills made Chi Xiaocheng soft and cute. [[6349 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was greatly moved when he saw this. [[6350 旁白 neutral]]
That little b*stard Ye Liang, still saying Chi Xiaocheng likes Su Tao and would be dangerous? [[6351 旁白 neutral]]
It's clear that Chi Xiaocheng likes me, Young Master! [[6352 旁白 neutral]]
She knows I like Su Tao, and she's even willing to sacrifice herself to prevent Ye Liang from getting close to Su Tao! [[6353 旁白 neutral]]
What is this if not love for me? [[6354 旁白 neutral]]
Really, I'm crying. [[6355 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's heart ached. Ever since he confirmed that Chi Xiaocheng's true nature was a clumsy little idiot, he found her more and more pleasing to the eye. [[6356 旁白 neutral]]
Emotions surged in his heart. Dongfang Yang immediately clenched his fist and pounded his chest, "Chi Xiaocheng, you're my employee. Next time Ye Liang dares to bully you, report him to me. He's got some nerve bullying my people!" [[6357 东方阳 angry]]
Then he looked at Su Tao, "Su Tao, you too. Next time Ye Liang yells at you, just ignore him. I've got your back." [[6358 东方阳 neutral]]
After saying that, he quickly added, "Of course, don't misunderstand. I don't care that much about you two. I just don't like that guy Ye Liang. As your boss and friend, I'm just supporting you incidentally." [[6359 东方阳 neutral]]
"That's it. If anything happens, message me on WeChat. I have something else to do, so I'm leaving first." [[6360 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang put his hands in his pockets and walked out of the cafe with light steps, humming a cheerful tune. [[6361 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, he was in a very good mood. [[6362 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at his retreating figure, Chi Xiaocheng's acting subsided, and she couldn't help but sigh, "Dongfang Yang is truly a good person!" [[6363 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded beside her, "He's always been a warm-hearted tsundere." [[6364 苏桃 neutral]]
Seeing his young master praised by two beauties, Butler Chu, sitting at the counter, couldn't help but smile proudly, "Young Master has always been like this. He usually donates a lot of money to mountainous areas from the large sums his family gives him." [[6365 褚三 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded gently. [[6366 旁白 neutral]]
If such a character wasn't on the opposing side, there would indeed be nothing to criticize. [[6367 旁白 neutral]]
However, although Dongfang Yang was a bit foolish, he seemed to still have some good feelings for Tao Tao. [[6368 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng ordered a cup of coffee from Butler Chu, then leaned close to Su Tao's ear and asked, "Tao Tao, you don't like Dongfang Yang, do you?" [[6369 池小橙 neutral]]
