Chapter 55 The Love of a Yandere, Unique (Bonus for Kira) [[4823 旁白 neutral]]
Humans have limits. [[4824 旁白 neutral]]
The more suppressed, the harder it is to think. [[4825 旁白 neutral]]
Just like a drowning person, once they touch that straw, they will cling to it desperately. Even if they cannot surface, they will hold onto that last hope and drag the straw into the water. [[4826 旁白 neutral]]
It took almost two days to set up such an environment. The straw Chi Xiaocheng left was naturally something that could completely change Su Tao's perception and make her obsessed. [[4827 旁白 neutral]]
Girls are such creatures. [[4828 旁白 neutral]]
Thin, delicate, soft, sweet, like the most beautiful product in the world, incredibly alluring. [[4829 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's previous punishments were not few. [[4830 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao resisted wholeheartedly, her mind completely elsewhere. [[4831 旁白 neutral]]
Confusion, disgust. Even if the touch was pleasant, Su Tao's subconscious would block this feeling. Her heart was like an iron door, completely sealed. [[4832 旁白 neutral]]
In that environment, how could she feel Chi Xiaocheng's beauty? [[4833 旁白 neutral]]
But now, she had actively opened the door to her heart. [[4834 旁白 neutral]]
Unable to bear the loneliness of being alone. [[4835 旁白 neutral]]
Unable to bear the endless cycle of days. [[4836 旁白 neutral]]
When she realized that no matter what, the food was unpalatable, and even more disgusting than excrement, she would react in that way. [[4837 旁白 neutral]]
As long as there is hope, people will not collapse. [[4838 旁白 neutral]]
What's more... [[4839 旁白 neutral]]
That's the female lead! [[4840 旁白 neutral]]
A white moonlight, with her own halo. [[4841 旁白 neutral]]
If she collapsed so easily, how could she become the only perfect existence in the novel? [[4842 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's index finger was still touching her lips. While waiting for Su Tao to act, her smile gradually became expectant. [[4843 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even realize that her originally calm crimson eyes had unconsciously become eerie. [[4844 旁白 neutral]]
Her face took on an unnatural flush, as if intoxicated. [[4845 旁白 neutral]]
And such a change was extremely obvious in Su Tao's eyes. [[4846 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, she would be scared, she would be afraid, she would think about how to soothe Chi Xiaocheng's emotions and make her transform from a yandere state back into the normal, cute Xiaocheng. [[4847 旁白 neutral]]
But now, in her eyes, there was only the thin, cherry-blossom pink of her fingertips. [[4848 旁白 neutral]]
That was the only sweetness different from the food. [[4849 旁白 neutral]]
Taking a step forward, Su Tao pulled Chi Xiaocheng. [[4850 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes closed. [[4851 旁白 neutral]]
Her movements were greedy and clumsy. [[4852 旁白 neutral]]
After an unknown period, when rationality surged into her mind, she met Chi Xiaocheng's satisfied smile. [[4853 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes were dazed, "Do you like it?" [[4854 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's throat was choked, unable to speak. [[4855 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze was somewhat dull, as if she was surprised and unable to comprehend what she had done. [[4856 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was not in a hurry. She slowly retreated to the door and brought in a bowl of rice. [[4857 旁白 neutral]]
She leaned close to Su Tao's ear and gently licked her earlobe, "I like it very much, Tao Tao. This is a reward~" [[4858 池小橙 neutral]]
A tingling sensation ran through Su Tao's earlobe, bringing her back to her senses quickly. [[4859 旁白 neutral]]
Looking up again, she found that Chi Xiaocheng had already left. [[4860 旁白 neutral]]
This was time deliberately left for her to think. [[4861 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao swallowed, and after hydrating, she felt a pang of hunger in her stomach. [[4862 旁白 neutral]]
She was afraid that this rice would be just as unpalatable, just as a hybrid mix of sour, sweet, bitter, and salty, just as dark cuisine. [[4863 旁白 neutral]]
Forget it, it doesn't matter. Am I going to starve myself to death if I don't eat? [[4864 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled obscurely, scooped up a spoonful, and took a small bite. [[4865 旁白 neutral]]
A normal, rich aroma spread from her tongue, and a line of hot tears flowed down. [[4866 旁白 neutral]]
"The taste is... normal." [[4867 苏桃 neutral]]
She ate ravenously, disregarding her image. [[4868 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did her eyes gradually clear. [[4869 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh, a reward, huh..." [[4870 苏桃 neutral]]
She couldn't help but think of the two answers Doctor Cheng had given her. [[4871 旁白 neutral]]
It was also the question she asked when she first met Doctor Cheng. [[4872 旁白 neutral]]
If she confirmed that Xiaocheng was indeed a yandere and couldn't be cured, what should she do? [[4873 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng answered like this. [[4874 旁白 neutral]]
A: If you don't want to move to another city and want to completely get rid of her, it's best to send her to a mental hospital. Keep her under strict supervision, just like how internet addiction schools treat internet addiction. Extreme methods for extreme people. [[4875 成医生 neutral]]
B, since you can't resist, try to enjoy it. The love of a yandere is unique! [[4876 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao's expression became complex. [[4877 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't like it. [[4878 旁白 neutral]]
But. [[4879 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't hate it that much either. [[4880 旁白 neutral]]
And all her emotional changes were transmitted to Chi Xiaocheng's phone through a hidden camera in the room. [[4881 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing her expression recover quite a bit, and then sitting there with her knees hugged, thinking, Chi Xiaocheng knew that her plan had succeeded. [[4882 旁白 neutral]]
The first step was successful. [[4883 旁白 neutral]]
"That's great~" [[4884 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng licked her lips, so excited that she danced with joy. [[4885 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, the system would have started complaining by now, but not hearing its voice made Chi Xiaocheng feel unaccustomed. [[4886 旁白 neutral]]
"System, how many emotion points are there in total?" [[4887 池小橙 neutral]]
[1732] [[4888 系统 neutral]]
In just two days, Su Tao alone provided so many emotion points! [[4889 旁白 neutral]]
It was a win-win! [[4890 旁白 neutral]]
"You're usually quite talkative, but now you're not saying anything. Shouldn't you express some opinion about Su Tao?" [[4891 池小橙 neutral]]
[I'm afraid you'll kill me if I say the wrong thing.] [[4892 系统 sad]]
"???" [[4893 池小橙 surprised]]
You're my only cheat, my helper! [[4894 旁白 neutral]]
Why would you think that?! [[4895 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said, "But your acting skill is really good. It's only intermediate level, but it's so powerful. I can perform with ease. Si Chen didn't notice anything wrong last time, and Su Tao was completely fooled by me this time." [[4896 池小橙 neutral]]
[Th-thank you for the compliment.] [[4897 系统 neutral]]
Next, Chi Xiaocheng completely immersed herself in studying with Su Tao. [[4898 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, the food was still unpalatable. Only when Su Tao actively asked for it would Chi Xiaocheng give her a reward. [[4899 旁白 neutral]]
In addition, Chi Xiaocheng did not interfere with Su Tao's sleep one night, allowing her to sleep for 8 hours. This female lead, who was on the verge of collapse, also regained much of her usual composure and rationality. [[4900 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she had completely adapted to life as a patient. [[4901 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was still that radiant white moonlight who treated her gently. [[4902 旁白 neutral]]
Just like that, two days passed. [[4903 旁白 neutral]]
Only one day remained until Chi Xiaocheng's original three-day plan. [[4904 旁白 neutral]]
A person disappearing from society for two days, even if Chi Xiaocheng tried to conceal it, would eventually be noticed. [[4905 旁白 neutral]]
The rational and astute Si Chen was one of them. [[4906 旁白 neutral]]
After chatting through messages several times, on the morning of the third day, he decisively called Su Tao. [[4907 旁白 neutral]]
The familiar ringing sound outside the door made Chi Xiaocheng, who was chatting with Su Tao, pause. [[4908 旁白 neutral]]
In the latter's surprised gaze, she slowly walked out, "Tao Tao, wait a moment. I'll answer the phone for you." [[4909 池小橙 neutral]]
At this moment, Su Tao belatedly realized something. [[4910 旁白 neutral]]
How many days had passed since the beginning? [[4911 旁白 neutral]]
For the first time, she felt the terrifying adaptability of humans. [[4912 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, after closing the door and picking up the phone, maintained her calm expression. [[4913 旁白 neutral]]
"Cough, cough." [[4914 旁白 neutral]]
She coughed twice and cleared her throat. [[4915 旁白 neutral]]
Pseudovoice skill, activate! [[4916 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello? Is this Si Chen?" [[4917 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng imitated Su Tao's tone, producing an identical voice. [[4918 旁白 neutral]]
Last time, when Ye Liang called, Chi Xiaocheng used this voice to dismiss him. [[4919 旁白 neutral]]
Facing Si Chen, she became even calmer. [[4920 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen heard the voice and seemed relieved. He asked, "Su Tao, where are you now?" [[4921 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng calmly replied, "I'm at Xiaocheng's house. She's sick, and I'm taking care of her." [[4922 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Really?" [[4923 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Ah? Why do you ask?" [[4924 池小橙 neutral]]
Everything was logical and reasonable. Even the rhetorical question was something Chi Xiaocheng had carefully studied. [[4925 旁白 neutral]]
However, after hearing this rhetorical question, Si Chen remained silent for a while. [[4926 旁白 neutral]]
After more than 10 seconds, Si Chen suddenly said, "Su Tao, I like you. Be my girlfriend." [[4927 司辰 neutral]]
Then, Chi Xiaocheng's act broke. [[4928 旁白 neutral]]
Her disguise instantly shattered, and a cold glint flashed in her crimson eyes. She almost uncontrollably rasped in her original voice, "Try saying that again?!" [[4929 池小橙 angry]]
