Chapter 88: Do you know what a yandere is? [[7672 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng recalled what she knew about this little follower. [[7673 旁白 neutral]]
She had gone to the same high school as the original owner. In her first year, just like the original owner, she was constantly bullied by Liu Guijia, Huang Limei, and their group. [[7674 旁白 neutral]]
But she and the original owner were complete opposites. [[7675 旁白 neutral]]
When the original owner was bullied, Su Tao would appear like a hero to protect her. [[7676 旁白 neutral]]
She would care for her, protect her, and teach Liu Guijia and the others a lesson. [[7677 旁白 neutral]]
But after being bullied for a whole year, this little follower, for some unknown reason, ended up joining Liu Guijia's group. [[7678 旁白 neutral]]
She became Liu Guijia's exclusive follower, and was occasionally taken away by the other two girls in the trio. [[7679 旁白 neutral]]
Whenever Liu Guijia and the others bullied the original owner or extorted money from other weaker students, this follower would be present. [[7680 旁白 neutral]]
She would be bullied and beaten along with them. [[7681 旁白 neutral]]
Afterward, she still had to continue doing chores for Liu Guijia and her friends and cleaning up their messes. [[7682 旁白 neutral]]
Although she was part of the delinquent girls' group, she didn't fit in. [[7683 旁白 neutral]]
The reason the original owner remembered this little girl was that when Liu Guijia and the others were bullying her, the follower wouldn't hit anyone. When called upon, she would just stand aside timidly, and then get yelled at. [[7684 旁白 neutral]]
Since she had transmigrated, the two times she had seen this follower, she had lived up to her name. [[7685 旁白 neutral]]
Just a follower. [[7686 旁白 neutral]]
But why was this girl here? [[7687 旁白 neutral]]
If it started snowing heavily, it wouldn't be surprising if she froze to death, right? [[7688 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng crouched down, curiously meeting the little follower's eyes. "Where's Liu Guijia? Aren't you cold, being here alone?" [[7689 池小橙 neutral]]
"Cold." The little follower's voice was flat, as if devoid of any emotion. "Liu Guijia doesn't want me anymore." [[7690 小跟班 sad]]
For her, this cold seemed far less painful than the sting of being abandoned. [[7691 旁白 neutral]]
A trace of curiosity flickered across Chi Xiaocheng's face. "What happened?" [[7692 池小橙 neutral]]
The little follower kept her head down, curled up in a ball. [[7693 旁白 neutral]]
But she still answered Chi Xiaocheng's question. "Someone with the last name Dongfang took Liu Guijia and her friends away. He said he wanted to correct their bad behavior." [[7694 小跟班 neutral]]
"Then, Liu Guijia threw this coat at me, said she didn't want me anymore, and told me to get lost." [[7695 小跟班 sad]]
"She locked me out of the backyard gate. I... no one wants me anymore." [[7696 小跟班 sad]]
Her voice remained detached and narrative, which was extremely unsettling. [[7697 旁白 neutral]]
Although her words showed she cared about what happened. [[7698 旁白 neutral]]
Her tone lacked any of the other emotions one would expect from being abandoned. [[7699 旁白 neutral]]
She had been bullied for three years, yet she was willing to stay by Liu Guijia's side and could even say things like being "abandoned." [[7700 旁白 neutral]]
This girl... [[7701 旁白 neutral]]
Could she have Stockholm syndrome? [[7702 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned, suddenly feeling that this was a tricky situation. [[7703 旁白 neutral]]
She asked, "Do you still remember me?" [[7704 池小橙 neutral]]
The little follower looked up at Chi Xiaocheng, and a flash of admiration crossed her empty eyes. "I remember. You're Chi Xiaocheng." [[7705 小跟班 neutral]]
Her voice held a slight tremor. "Last time at your house, I remember you hit Liu Guijia and scared her. I... I've always wanted to be like you!" [[7706 小跟班 happy]]
After blurting it out, the little follower shrank back again. "Sorry." [[7707 小跟班 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at her thoughtfully. "Since you know me, you must know Su Tao too, right?" [[7708 池小橙 neutral]]
The little follower paused for a moment. "The cool girl with long, grayish-black hair and a streak of pink?" [[7709 小跟班 neutral]]
"Yes." [[7710 池小橙 neutral]]
"I've seen her." [[7711 小跟班 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes lit up. "Do you like her?" [[7712 池小橙 happy]]
The little follower looked at Chi Xiaocheng in confusion. "What does 'like' mean?" [[7713 小跟班 neutral]]
Seeing her clueless expression, a plan suddenly formed in Chi Xiaocheng's mind. [[7714 旁白 neutral]]
She stood up and held out her hand to the little follower. "If no one wants you, you can come with me." [[7715 池小橙 neutral]]
This girl had been with Liu Guijia for three years and was still like this; she hadn't been corrupted and wasn't a bad person at heart. [[7716 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't just let her freeze to death here. [[7717 旁白 neutral]]
After all, in high school, she and the original owner had shared the same misfortune. [[7718 旁白 neutral]]
The only difference between them was a Su Tao. [[7719 旁白 neutral]]
But to her surprise, after reaching out her hand, the little follower paused mid-air. [[7720 旁白 neutral]]
She timidly averted her gaze and pulled back her dirty, scarred hand. "Never mind, I'll only cause you trouble." [[7721 小跟班 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng said helplessly, "Come on, what kind of trouble could you possibly cause me?" [[7722 池小橙 neutral]]
The little follower said, "You're not like Liu Guijia. It was fine for her to use me and then throw me away. You wouldn't do that." [[7723 小跟班 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng laughed in exasperation. "I have to ask, are you a masochist? You'd rather be beaten up than cause trouble for others?" [[7724 池小橙 angry]]
Without waiting for the little follower to refuse, she grabbed her hand. "One minute you say no one wants you, and the next you're shrinking away when someone does." [[7725 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng pulled her to her feet and turned around, saying, "From now on, you're my follower." [[7726 池小橙 neutral]]
With that, she pulled her away toward her house without another word. [[7727 旁白 neutral]]
Her frostbitten feet stumbled along behind Chi Xiaocheng. "Why?" [[7728 小跟班 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed helplessly. [[7729 旁白 neutral]]
She stopped. [[7730 旁白 neutral]]
Turning back to face the little follower, she let the wind blow through her hair. [[7731 旁白 neutral]]
What a hassle. [[7732 旁白 neutral]]
Hmm... what was I supposed to say? [[7733 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tried to recall what a protagonist would say in all those dramatic scenes. [[7734 旁白 neutral]]
So she said calmly to the little follower, "Because I need you!" [[7735 池小橙 neutral]]
A gust of wind blew the follower's messy black hair away from her face, revealing her small, slightly open mouth on her dirty, youthful face. [[7736 旁白 neutral]]
Her once-empty eyes gradually filled with a brownish tint. [[7737 旁白 neutral]]
That unusual gaze was full of admiration. [[7738 旁白 neutral]]
The snow seemed to have stopped. [[7739 旁白 neutral]]
She was led stumbling into Chi Xiaocheng's house and then pushed into the bathroom. [[7740 旁白 neutral]]
A set of clean clothes was tossed in. [[7741 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's disdainful voice followed, "Wash yourself properly. The clothes are new, I haven't worn them yet. You seem to be about my size, so they should fit. You can soak in the bathtub to avoid catching a cold. Make sure you scrub yourself clean." [[7742 池小橙 neutral]]
Only when the hot water hit her body, the warmth chasing away the cold, did the little follower belatedly realize what had happened. [[7743 旁白 neutral]]
She had followed her home. [[7744 旁白 neutral]]
The warm air conditioning, the new clothes she was given, and the feeling of being needed. [[7745 旁白 neutral]]
The little follower closed her eyes, letting the hot water wash over her. [[7746 旁白 neutral]]
"It's so warm." [[7747 小跟班 happy]]
Her voice was still flat, but the corners of her lips curled up involuntarily. [[7748 旁白 neutral]]
After about half an hour in the bathroom, Chi Xiaocheng saw the little follower come out, drying her hair with a towel. [[7749 旁白 neutral]]
Wearing a short-sleeved shirt with an orange print, now clean and with her hair no longer hiding her face, Chi Xiaocheng finally got a clear look at the little follower. [[7750 旁白 neutral]]
It could be summed up in two words. [[7751 旁白 neutral]]
Small and thin. [[7752 旁白 neutral]]
Her features were delicate and her face was thin. Not only were her arms covered in old scars, but her face was too. [[7753 旁白 neutral]]
Only her brown eyes had some life in them. Her own small-sized clothes seemed a bit big on the girl. [[7754 旁白 neutral]]
Her height seemed to be... around 148 cm? [[7755 旁白 neutral]]
She was very thin, with almost no chest, clearly suffering from severe malnutrition. [[7756 旁白 neutral]]
She looked a little dazed, but not stupid, and actively looked for the hairdryer to start drying her hair. [[7757 旁白 neutral]]
However, she had a lot of hair, which reached almost to her hips, making it incredibly difficult to manage. [[7758 旁白 neutral]]
After seeing that her emotions had stabilized, Chi Xiaocheng beckoned her to sit down and asked softly, "Little one, do you know what a yandere is?" [[7759 池小橙 neutral]]
