Chapter 75: The Breakup of Su Tao and Ye Liang [[6562 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's appearance was perfectly timed. [[6563 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Ye Liang had already been angered by Chi Xiaocheng and was reaching for the knife in her stomach. [[6564 旁白 neutral]]
So, from an outsider's point of view, Su Tao arrived just in time to see Ye Liang stab Chi Xiaocheng. [[6565 旁白 neutral]]
The small girl clutched her stomach, her face twisted in pain. [[6566 旁白 neutral]]
And the reality... [[6567 旁白 neutral]]
At least, the "reality" in Su Tao's eyes was just like that. [[6568 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang looked at Su Tao in a panic, quickly taking a step back. "Su Tao, let me explain! It's not what you see!" [[6569 叶良 sad]]
Facing Ye Liang, Chi Xiaocheng curled her lips into a smile. [[6570 池小橙 happy]]
But when she turned to look at Su Tao, the smile on her face turned to misery. [[6571 旁白 neutral]]
She stumbled and fell to the ground. "Tao... Taotao..." [[6572 池小橙 sad]]
Even though her heart was filled with complicated emotions, the sight of the bright red blood still made her feel a pang of heartache. [[6573 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly rushed to Chi Xiaocheng's side and held her. [[6574 旁白 neutral]]
A flash of hesitation crossed her face, but it hardened into determination as she looked at Ye Liang. "Ye Liang, do you hate Xiaocheng so much that you would hurt her?!" [[6575 苏桃 angry]]
As the words left her mouth, her heart ached with a hidden pain. [[6576 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't even notice that her hand holding Chi Xiaocheng was trembling slightly. [[6577 旁白 neutral]]
Her words lacked the real anger they should have had. [[6578 旁白 neutral]]
If judged by Chi Xiaocheng's "intermediate acting skills," Su Tao probably had no acting skills at all. [[6579 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang, who was already angry, lost his composure the moment he saw Su Tao. [[6580 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't even realize that her words were just an act. [[6581 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang said anxiously, "Su Tao, let me explain! I didn't do anything. This was all staged by Chi Xiaocheng!" [[6582 叶良 sad]]
"Is that so?" Su Tao looked at Ye Liang with empty eyes. "Didn't you say you wanted to make Xiaocheng disappear from here forever? How do you explain that the snow has turned red?" [[6583 苏桃 sad]]
"Are you trying to say Xiaocheng did this to herself?!" [[6584 苏桃 angry]]
As she spoke the last words, Su Tao shouted with all her might to hide her own fear. [[6585 旁白 neutral]]
The situation as it was, was the truth. [[6586 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Ye Liang jumped into the Yellow River, he couldn't wash himself clean. [[6587 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, Chi Xiaocheng, buried in Su Tao's arms, forced a weak smile. [[6588 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, it hurts a little." [[6589 池小橙 sad]]
"But don't worry, I'm already used to it." [[6590 池小橙 sad]]
"I'm very strong, I'm not crying~" [[6591 池小橙 sad]]
Her smile went from forced to miserable, and then she slowly closed her eyes, fainting weakly in Su Tao's arms. [[6592 旁白 neutral]]
This was an obvious act. [[6593 旁白 neutral]]
In front of both Su Tao and Ye Liang. [[6594 旁白 neutral]]
But even knowing it was an act, hearing such chilling words spoken softly was still terrifying. [[6595 旁白 neutral]]
Besides a trace of pity, fear and dread filled Su Tao's heart. [[6596 旁白 neutral]]
She looked up at Ye Liang, her lips trembling. "Ye Liang, you still like me, right?" [[6597 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang's eyes widened as he stared at Su Tao. "Su Tao, what do you mean?" [[6598 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao's eyelashes fluttered as she reached out to touch Chi Xiaocheng's face. "I mean, don't contact me anymore." [[6599 苏桃 sad]]
Hearing this, Ye Liang's barely suppressed anger flared up again. "Hehe, hahahahaha!" [[6600 叶良 angry]]
"Su Tao, you're really going to draw a line with me for this bitch, Chi Xiaocheng?!" [[6601 叶良 angry]]
The word "bitch" seemed to trigger Su Tao. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she knelt on the ground, looking at Ye Liang with determination. "Yes, for Xiaocheng, I'm drawing a line with you!" [[6602 苏桃 sad]]
"Say that again!" [[6603 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang took a step forward, glaring at Su Tao with a fierce intensity, his red eyes like those of a man-eating tiger. "Su Tao, ask yourself, haven't I treated you well? From the first day we met, I've been completely devoted to you. I'd give you anything you want. People in our circle even say I'm your lapdog!" [[6604 叶良 angry]]
"As a CEO worth over a hundred million, what kind of woman can't I find?" [[6605 叶良 angry]]
"For you, I broke off the marriage alliance with my family in the capital and nearly had a falling out with them!" [[6606 叶良 angry]]
"For you, I held banquets repeatedly to let you experience things ordinary people can't. Even so, Chi Xiaocheng caused trouble every time, but to accommodate you, I'd rather have my reputation ruined than do anything to her!" [[6607 叶良 angry]]
"I've respected all your choices and have almost never forced you to do anything, right? Isn't it obvious how I feel about you?!" [[6608 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang laughed loudly again. "Months have passed, and you've enjoyed everything. But now you're telling me that this person who has targeted us for so long is the most important to you." [[6609 叶良 angry]]
"Then what about me?!" [[6610 叶良 angry]]
"Do I have no place in your heart at all?!" [[6611 叶良 angry]]
"I don't believe you can't see she's acting! Chi Xiaocheng is a yandere, she'll end up hurting you, don't you know that?!" [[6612 叶良 angry]]
The words were practically roared, making Ye Liang's chest heave violently. [[6613 旁白 neutral]]
He had been holding back these words for a long time. [[6614 旁白 neutral]]
He had held back again and again to spare Su Tao's feelings. [[6615 旁白 neutral]]
But for what? [[6616 旁白 neutral]]
Why should Chi Xiaocheng get everything from her? [[6617 旁白 neutral]]
Why is it that after all the wrong she has done for months, she can be forgiven and return to Su Tao's side with just a small change? Is what I, Ye Liang, have done for these past few months not enough?! [[6618 叶良 angry]]
He had never spent more than a week on any single person! [[6619 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to see an expression of guilt and regret on Su Tao's face, but when he looked down, the girl kneeling on the ground was just crying bitterly. [[6620 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang, you keep saying you've done so much for me, but how can you be sure it's what I would like?" [[6621 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao answered Ye Liang's questions one by one. [[6622 旁白 neutral]]
"You broke things off with your family for me. That was your choice." [[6623 苏桃 sad]]
"You ruined your reputation by holding banquets for me, but did you ever ask if I wanted to attend them?" [[6624 苏桃 sad]]
"You wanted to give me everything and have me join your upper-class circle, but do you know that all I want is a simple, warm, and ordinary life?" [[6625 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao wiped away a tear, forcing herself to stop crying. "After all these months, I'm grateful for your efforts, but do you remember what I told you at the beginning?" [[6626 苏桃 sad]]
"I don't need anything from you, and I don't like your money or your lifestyle. If we could just be like friends, then there would be a place for you in my life." [[6627 苏桃 sad]]
"But did you ever treat me as a friend, and do you remember what I told you from the start?" [[6628 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang: "I like you, so why should I treat you as a friend?!" [[6629 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao gave a faint smile. "Ye Liang, you've always been so arrogant, thinking you're always right. You think that just because you like someone, everything should go your way, but you never try to understand what the person you like actually wants." [[6630 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao took a soft breath, her voice trembling. "You hate Xiaocheng because of me, right? From today on, we have no relationship. So don't hurt Xiaocheng because of me anymore." [[6631 苏桃 sad]]
It was as if that speech took all of her strength. [[6632 旁白 neutral]]
She almost collapsed onto the snow. [[6633 旁白 neutral]]
But feeling the warmth of the small body in her arms, she forced herself to stay upright. [[6634 旁白 neutral]]
This... was her choice! [[6635 旁白 neutral]]
Her only choice. [[6636 旁白 neutral]]
Did it matter if her words were true or not? [[6637 旁白 neutral]]
This was the only way to keep Xiaocheng safe, to stop her from hurting herself. [[6638 旁白 neutral]]
And it was the only chance... to cure her yandere personality. [[6639 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up again and saw Ye Liang's defeated expression. She spoke softly, "Ye Liang, you should go." [[6640 苏桃 sad]]
"Go?" [[6641 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang's expression changed from defeated to ferocious. [[6642 旁白 neutral]]
Facing Su Tao, he no longer had the composure of a young master and CEO, but roared like a wild beast, "You're clearly being forced by Chi Xiaocheng too, so why are you telling me to leave?!" [[6643 叶良 angry]]
At that moment, Su Tao, who had been suppressing her emotions, finally broke down completely. [[6644 旁白 neutral]]
