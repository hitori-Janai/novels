Chapter 236: As Humble as She [[20239 旁白 neutral]]
Conflicted, heartbroken, hesitant—utterly conflicted. [[20240 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao held the candied hawthorn behind her back with one hand and clutched her heart with the other. Despite the storm of emotions, she hadn't forgotten why she was here. [[20241 旁白 neutral]]
To apologize! [[20242 苏桃 neutral]]
Even if Xiaocheng still hates me! [[20243 苏桃 sad]]
I have to say it. Even if she scolds me, I just want to talk to her! [[20244 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly looked up, her eyes so determined they were slightly bloodshot. She took a step forward and said seriously and loudly, "Xiaocheng, I… I came to apologize!" [[20245 苏桃 sad]]
After speaking, she bowed deeply at a 90-degree angle, offering a stick of candied hawthorn with both hands. [[20246 旁白 neutral]]
It was like presenting flowers for a confession. [[20247 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't dare to look up, stammering, "This gift… I just bought it. I… I have no money left. I've been shamelessly eating at Dongfang Yang's cafe lately, so…" [[20248 苏桃 sad]]
"So, I will definitely get you a better, more important gift later!" [[20249 苏桃 neutral]]
After saying this, Su Tao held her breath, not daring to make a sound. [[20250 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, she had planned to list all her past mistakes and explain how she would correct them in the future, approaching it with the seriousness of writing a research paper to earn Xiaocheng's forgiveness. [[20251 旁白 neutral]]
But the moment she saw Chi Xiaocheng and heard her say she didn't want to see her, Su Tao's mind went blank. [[20252 旁白 sad]]
Her apology was just an apology; she didn't even explain what she had done wrong. [[20253 旁白 neutral]]
Now, she was prepared for Chi Xiaocheng to dislike her even more, perhaps even to hate her. [[20254 旁白 sad]]
Unexpectedly, she heard that same calm voice, "Alright, I forgive you." [[20255 池小橙 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[20256 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up in astonishment, her eyes filled with disbelief. [[20257 旁白 neutral]]
What did Xiaocheng just say? [[20258 苏桃 neutral]]
Did I… Did I just imagine that? [[20259 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said faintly, "What are you still standing there for?" [[20260 池小橙 neutral]]
"No… I…" Su Tao slowly straightened up, still not daring to look Chi Xiaocheng in the eye, only stealing a few glances. "Xiaocheng, you forgive me just like that? I thought…" [[20261 苏桃 neutral]]
"Oh, if you put it that way, then I won't forgive you." [[20262 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng cut her off, her tone still calm. [[20263 旁白 neutral]]
But this made the girl anxious. [[20264 旁白 neutral]]
She hurried to Chi Xiaocheng's side. "No, please, Xiaocheng, forgive me, okay? I really know I was wrong. Everything I did before… it was all wrong. I'll definitely change. Please don't hate me, okay?" [[20265 苏桃 sad]]
The girl's voice was urgent, yet tinged with a hint of humility. [[20266 旁白 neutral]]
The recent emotional roller coaster had finally made it impossible for her to think rationally. [[20267 旁白 neutral]]
A faint smile touched Chi Xiaocheng's lips for a moment before she suppressed it. She said slowly to Su Tao, "If you unwrap the candied hawthorn for me, I'll forgive you." [[20268 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao was overjoyed to hear this. [[20269 旁白 happy]]
Even she could tell that Chi Xiaocheng was just being a little stubborn and moody, not looking at her with the undisguised disgust from before. [[20270 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly tore open the wrapper of the candied hawthorn. [[20271 旁白 neutral]]
There were only four pieces on the stick, but they were all large. [[20272 旁白 neutral]]
When Chi Xiaocheng took it, she had to open her small, cherry-like mouth wide to take a whole bite. [[20273 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao asked cautiously, "Is it sweet?" [[20274 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's alright." [[20275 池小橙 neutral]]
Chewing on the candied hawthorn, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't suppress a smile this time. Like Su Tao, she had a sweet tooth. [[20276 旁白 happy]]
And this candied hawthorn was so sweet it was almost overwhelming, which made it taste wonderful. [[20277 旁白 happy]]
But… my answer to you can't be "sweet." [[20278 池小橙 neutral]]
Seeing that Chi Xiaocheng had gone quiet again, Su Tao began to organize her thoughts. Following what Professor Su had said, she started her apology to Chi Xiaocheng. [[20279 旁白 neutral]]
Relying on her jumbled memories, she began to distance herself from the already deceased Ye Liang. [[20280 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know Ye Liang was that kind of person. [[20281 苏桃 sad]]
She had been deceived by him and had failed to take care of her. [[20282 苏桃 sad]]
This time, Su Tao wasn't just making excuses for herself; she also admitted to many of her own mistakes. [[20283 旁白 neutral]]
Although many of her memories were confused, her memory of one thing was clear. [[20284 旁白 neutral]]
During the summer vacation after high school, she and Chi Xiaocheng had a fight. [[20285 旁白 neutral]]
After that, for various reasons, she didn't see Xiaocheng for several months. [[20286 旁白 neutral]]
And just like that, the once-lovely girl had gradually turned into a Yandere. [[20287 旁白 sad]]
Now, thinking back on that time, Su Tao felt so guilty she could hardly lift her head. [[20288 旁白 sad]]
Originally, Chi Xiaocheng's parents had only planned for her to attend a poor local college, thinking it would be close to home. [[20289 旁白 neutral]]
It was Su Tao who had insisted, against everyone's advice, on bringing Chi Xiaocheng to the big city of Jiuzhou to attend a good university. [[20290 旁白 neutral]]
Back then, Chi's parents, who had raised her for over a decade, had entrusted Xiaocheng to her, telling her to take good care of her. [[20291 旁白 neutral]]
But what happened? Before college even started, they had a falling out. [[20292 旁白 sad]]
Far from home, she was all alone in this unfamiliar environment. [[20293 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao was now filled with regret, wanting to slap herself. She couldn't understand how she could have been so awful back then, ignoring her true family, Xiaocheng, for a scoundrel like Ye Liang. [[20294 旁白 sad]]
She had taken the wrong path, step by step, and now she had to do everything she could to make things right. [[20295 旁白 neutral]]
While she was speaking, Chi Xiaocheng had already finished two pieces of the candied hawthorn. [[20296 旁白 neutral]]
When Su Tao fell silent, Chi Xiaocheng also lowered her head slowly. "Actually… I was never really angry with you." [[20297 池小橙 sad]]
"Really, Xiaocheng?!" [[20298 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao excitedly grabbed one of Chi Xiaocheng's hands. [[20299 旁白 happy]]
Her eyes brightened. [[20300 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded lightly. "I knew you wouldn't abandon me. I was just a little upset. You used to promise you would always be on my side, but that time, you yelled at me." [[20301 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao didn't know which memory Chi Xiaocheng's "yelled at me" referred to, but she knew it was best to just admit fault. [[20302 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng continued, "And I misunderstood you, too. I'm sorry…" [[20303 池小橙 sad]]
"No, no, it's all my fault. You don't need to apologize, Xiaocheng." [[20304 苏桃 neutral]]
"And also…" Chi Xiaocheng hesitated, then pulled back the hand Su Tao was holding. "I don't know why, but I always have this feeling of wanting to reject you. I know you've always been good to me, but…" [[20305 池小橙 sad]]
"But I just can't say it. When you get close to me, I feel a little uncomfortable." [[20306 池小橙 sad]]
"I can't really control this feeling." [[20307 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a breath. "So, could you please give me a little more time to get used to it?" [[20308 池小橙 neutral]]
After listening to Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao watched as she turned her head away. [[20309 旁白 neutral]]
The light in her eyes dimmed slightly, then turned into a hint of confusion. [[20310 旁白 sad]]
The misunderstanding was resolved, but why were things still like this? [[20311 苏桃 sad]]
She didn't quite understand, but she was content that Xiaocheng was willing to say this much. [[20312 旁白 neutral]]
Things had to be solved one step at a time. She could ask Dr. Cheng about what she didn't understand later. [[20313 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled and nodded lightly. "Okay. As long as you don't hate me, Xiaocheng. And also… can I still take care of you like before?" [[20314 苏桃 neutral]]
She looked on with anticipation after she spoke. [[20315 旁白 neutral]]
As humble as she was, she now needed permission just to take care of someone. [[20316 旁白 sad]]
