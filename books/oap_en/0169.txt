Chapter 169: The Death of Ye Liang [[14766 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes, once dark and crazed, suddenly filled with panic. [[14767 旁白 neutral]]
The hand holding the fruit knife trembled uncontrollably. Su Tao took two steps back from Ye Liang, her haggard face showing a mix of tension and fear. [[14768 旁白 neutral]]
The person Su Tao wanted to see least—the one she was even afraid of—was Chi Song. [[14769 旁白 neutral]]
This older brother had treated her like his own sister, looking after her since childhood and repeatedly entrusting Chi Xiaocheng to her care. [[14770 旁白 neutral]]
And what had she done? [[14771 苏桃 sad]]
She had caused Chi Xiaocheng to close her eyes forever, separating her from the brother who adored her. [[14772 旁白 sad]]
Her killing intent toward Ye Liang instantly turned into guilt. Su Tao stood frozen, the hand holding the knife falling limp at her side. [[14773 旁白 sad]]
She didn't dare to look up and meet Chi Song's eyes. [[14774 旁白 neutral]]
As she felt him walk toward her, step by step, a voice inside her screamed in fear. [[14775 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't come any closer..." [[14776 苏桃 sad]]
"I didn't do it on purpose..." [[14777 苏桃 sad]]
"Please don't scold me, I really didn't mean to..." [[14778 苏桃 sad]]
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." [[14779 苏桃 sad]]
The footsteps stopped in front of her. [[14780 旁白 neutral]]
With her head lowered, Su Tao's dry lips moved a few times. "Brother... Brother Chi Song." [[14781 苏桃 sad]]
Her voice was so small that she wondered if Chi Song could even hear it. [[14782 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, Chi Song's voice reached her ears. "Why are you looking down? Lift your head." [[14783 池松 neutral]]
His calm voice made Su Tao tremble, but she summoned her courage and raised her head. [[14784 旁白 neutral]]
The one-armed man met her gaze, then raised his right hand high. [[14785 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Su Tao shut her eyes in fear. [[14786 旁白 neutral]]
She tilted her head slightly but didn't dodge or move her cheek away. [[14787 旁白 neutral]]
She deserved this slap. [[14788 旁白 sad]]
However, the hand never landed on her face. [[14789 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, it gently stroked her messy hair. [[14790 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song's deep, soft voice reached her ears. "Don't be afraid, your brother is here. How can a girl do something like this? Go downstairs and wait for me. I'll handle things here." [[14791 池松 neutral]]
After stroking her hair, Chi Song stepped in front of Su Tao and gently pushed her toward the rooftop door. [[14792 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stumbled back a few steps and looked at Chi Song in shock. "Brother Chi Song, I..." [[14793 苏桃 neutral]]
"We can talk about it later." [[14794 池松 neutral]]
With his back to Su Tao, Chi Song spoke without turning his head. "I'm going to avenge my little sister now. It's best if you avoid a scene like this, Xiao Tao." [[14795 池松 neutral]]
"I don't want this to become a nightmare that haunts you in the future." [[14796 池松 neutral]]
As an older brother, how could he let his sister put herself in danger? [[14797 旁白 neutral]]
Let your big brother handle the dirty work. [[14798 池松 neutral]]
Chi Song glanced at Ye Liang, and after confirming he couldn't get up, he pulled Su Tao to the rooftop stairwell without waiting for her response. [[14799 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly said, "Brother Chi Song, I... I want to avenge Xiaocheng too. I can do it, I..." [[14800 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Song smiled gently. "Alright, Xiao Tao, your hands are shaking. Leave the rest to me. Besides, it's not a sight for you to see." [[14801 池松 neutral]]
Before Su Tao could argue, Chi Song gave her a gentle push. [[14802 旁白 neutral]]
Then, he slammed the rooftop door shut. [[14803 旁白 neutral]]
And locked it from the inside. [[14804 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how loudly Su Tao pounded on the door, Chi Song's expression didn't change, instead growing more determined and grim. [[14805 旁白 neutral]]
Keeping Su Tao away from this was only part of the reason. [[14806 旁白 neutral]]
If she really killed Ye Liang... [[14807 旁白 neutral]]
What about the revenge from the Ye family? [[14808 旁白 neutral]]
It was better for him, a homeless punk with no future, to be hunted down and killed than for Su Tao, who still had a bright future ahead of her. [[14809 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song reached to his waist, pulled out a handgun, and walked toward Ye Liang step by step. [[14810 旁白 angry]]
Unlike Su Tao, he would show no mercy. [[14811 旁白 angry]]
And Ye Liang knew this as well. [[14812 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the dark gun appeared, he lost any chance to beg for his life. [[14813 旁白 neutral]]
Leaning against a wall, Ye Liang seemed to truly feel despair and burst out laughing. "Hahahaha, Chi Song, oh Chi Song, you don't really think you can kill me, do you!" [[14814 叶良 angry]]
Chi Song stood five meters away, watching him with a blank expression. [[14815 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's face twisted into a snarl. "I was going to beg Su Tao, but now you've forced my hand! I'll give up my position as the young master of the Ye family to take you all down with me!" [[14816 叶良 angry]]
His words were meant to scare Chi Song, but the one-armed man simply raised the gun with a cold expression and aimed it at him. [[14817 旁白 neutral]]
Fear of death crept up his spine, and Ye Liang suddenly shouted, "Elder Ye! I... I, Ye Liang, give up the fight to be the Ye family heir! Save... save me!" [[14818 叶良 sad]]
As he spoke, a deep, old sigh came from a shadow on the rooftop. "That's enough, young friend. For my sake, please spare this boy's life." [[14819 叶老 neutral]]
An old man on the verge of death walked out from a shadow. [[14820 旁白 neutral]]
No one knew how long he had been there. [[14821 旁白 neutral]]
What was even stranger was that although the old man looked frail and hunched, his steps were steady, and he seemed to move with a faint breeze. [[14822 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song glanced at the old man, his expression unchanged. [[14823 旁白 neutral]]
Elder Ye chuckled softly. "Young friend, this is my contract with the Ye family. If Ye Liang gives up his position as heir, I can save his life. I have no intention of harming you. You should leave." [[14824 叶老 neutral]]
Chi Song frowned. "Leave? He killed my sister. A life for a life!" [[14825 池松 angry]]
He could faintly sense the danger this old man posed, but he would not back down. [[14826 旁白 neutral]]
He raised his gun and aimed it at the old man. [[14827 旁白 neutral]]
But Elder Ye showed no fear, just a faint smile. "Young friend, have you ever heard of ancient martial artists?" (World-building note: This book is not about cultivation or high-level martial arts, but focuses on sweet, everyday romance.) [[14828 叶老 neutral]]
He began to explain slowly. [[14829 旁白 neutral]]
"For generations, in our great nation of Zhou, ancient martial artists have inherited extraordinary powers through bloodlines and family heritage, allowing them to pluck leaves to use as weapons and walk on water." [[14830 叶老 neutral]]
"Even an old man like me would only need a single pebble to take care of you, young friend." [[14831 叶老 neutral]]
Elder Ye glanced at Chi Song's handgun with a disdainful smile. "Besides, haven't you heard, young friend? Beyond seven steps, the gun is faster. But within seven steps..." [[14832 叶老 neutral]]
Bang! [[14833 旁白 neutral]]
A gunshot rang out. [[14834 旁白 neutral]]
Elder Ye's mouth was still open when a bullet hole appeared on his forehead. [[14835 旁白 neutral]]
His eyes widened in disbelief. [[14836 旁白 neutral]]
Even as he fell, he stared intently at Chi Song. [[14837 旁白 neutral]]
As if cursing this young friend for having no martial ethics. [[14838 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was already stunned. [[14839 旁白 neutral]]
He could never have imagined that Elder Ye, who had always protected him in secret and only appeared at life-or-death moments, would die so dramatically. [[14840 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's face twisted as he cursed, "You old fool, I could just kill you! Why were you trying to act so tough!" [[14841 叶良 angry]]
It was true that ancient martial artists were stronger than ordinary people. In a fistfight, an energetic one could possibly take on a hundred men. [[14842 旁白 neutral]]
But even at the peak of their training, they could barely dodge a bullet. [[14843 旁白 neutral]]
This was why Ye Liang was cursing. [[14844 旁白 neutral]]
What era was this? Even gangs used guns in their fights, and here you were, trying to flick pebbles at people? [[14845 旁白 neutral]]
What could your stupid pebble flick away? [[14846 旁白 neutral]]
Crow's feet? [[14847 旁白 neutral]]
Elder Ye had been his greatest support. Now that he was dead, Ye Liang knew he had to face Chi Song alone. [[14848 旁白 neutral]]
Money? Power? Fame? Women? [[14849 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song was just a punk; maybe one of these things could convince him to spare his life. [[14850 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, that's right! I, Ye Liang, am the chosen one! There must still be a chance! [[14851 叶良 happy]]
Ye Liang smiled, turned to Chi Song, and raised a hand to speak. "Chi..." [[14852 旁白 neutral]]
Bang! [[14853 旁白 neutral]]
Another gunshot echoed across the dark and gloomy rooftop. [[14854 旁白 neutral]]
The so-called chosen one no longer had anyone to protect him. [[14855 旁白 neutral]]
A matching bullet hole appeared on his forehead. His eyes were wide open, and his body froze on the spot. [[14856 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't even finished his sentence. [[14857 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was dead. [[14858 旁白 sad]]
PS: I've been sent to the "little black room." I'll see if I can fight my way back. I will work hard to revise the text and get it reinstated. Please be patient, don't drop the book for now, and please don't abandon me. [[14859 旁白 neutral]]
