Chapter 35 Not Like Acting [[2964 旁白 neutral]]
Fear, trembling, her back was soaked with cold sweat at some point. [[2965 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia could actually feel that Chi Xiaocheng's body hadn't changed at all. She only needed to exert a little force to subdue this sickly girl. [[2966 旁白 neutral]]
But her body was completely out of control. [[2967 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't move at all! [[2968 旁白 neutral]]
Eerie crimson vertical pupils, her face covered in crimson like a trickling stream, a small tongue licking the cold blade, as if tasting her own flavor. [[2969 旁白 neutral]]
I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die! [[2970 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Liu Guijia's hands trembled, but she couldn't muster any strength. Her gaze flickered, searching around, casting a pleading look at the disheveled, knee-hugging follower. [[2971 旁白 neutral]]
But the scene before her eyes made her pupils contract once more. [[2972 旁白 neutral]]
The follower was squatting on the ground, staring intently at her. Liu Guijia noticed that the follower's face, hidden by her hair, was no longer gloomy. [[2973 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she wore a look of obsession, her eyes shining with a light Liu Guijia had never seen before. [[2974 旁白 neutral]]
—She wouldn't help her. [[2975 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia felt despair. [[2976 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, she was also like Chi Xiaocheng. Why would she help herself at this moment? [[2977 旁白 neutral]]
"Clearly, we're all the same, all dogs!" Perhaps anger rushed to her head, giving Liu Guijia a little strength back. [[2978 旁白 neutral]]
She gritted her teeth and glared at Chi Xiaocheng, trying to scare her, "If you have the guts, kill me now, otherwise you'll be dead later. Not just you, but Su Tao too, that b*tch..." [[2979 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Ah—!!!" [[2980 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Before she could finish, she felt a sharp pain in her thigh. [[2981 旁白 neutral]]
Intimidation turned into provocation. [[2982 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng half-squatted, half-knelt in front of her, a faint smile playing on her lips, "I didn't hear what you said. Can you speak louder?" [[2983 池小橙 neutral]]
"The windows are all closed, you know~" [[2984 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, calm down!] [[2985 系统 neutral]]
At this moment, the system couldn't help but intervene. [[2986 旁白 neutral]]
[If something goes wrong, we, as villains, will have no chance of turning things around. Even the female lead's halo won't save us!] [[2987 系统 sad]]
"Don't worry, System." [[2988 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's calm voice echoed in her mind. [[2989 旁白 neutral]]
The system breathed a sigh of relief. [[2990 旁白 neutral]]
[It's good that you're still rational, Host. You scared me to death. I thought you had lost your mind because of the female lead, Su Tao.] [[2991 系统 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled, replying in her mind, "Why would I lose my mind? You're being ridiculous." [[2992 池小橙 neutral]]
"Actually, I personally know that although I transmigrated here and am bound to you, to be honest, from what I've learned from the memories, the original owner didn't actually die. I just took over her body." [[2993 池小橙 neutral]]
"Occasionally, when I act abnormally, I believe it's because the original owner's lingering thoughts are influencing me." [[2994 池小橙 neutral]]
Her analysis was as rational as she claimed. [[2995 旁白 neutral]]
"It's like now, you think I'm impulsive because she mentioned Su Tao, but I know that's not the case." [[2996 池小橙 neutral]]
"It's the original owner's lingering thoughts influencing me. She was bullied for three years and hated Liu Guijia immensely." [[2997 池小橙 neutral]]
"Even when she was bullied, she didn't dare to resist. She didn't have the courage." [[2998 池小橙 neutral]]
"But I'm different!" [[2999 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes sparkled, "I'm not afraid of her, so the original owner's lingering thoughts are influencing me to seek revenge." [[3000 池小橙 neutral]]
"That's the main reason I'm like this now. In reality, my rationality hasn't broken down at all, and I haven't been influenced by Su Tao." [[3001 池小橙 neutral]]
While chatting with the system in her mind, she unconsciously uttered, "After all, I said it, I'm not really a yandere." [[3002 池小橙 neutral]]
[But Host, you really don't seem to be acting.] [[3003 系统 neutral]]
[How come I, as the system, didn't detect the original owner's thoughts and soul?] [[3004 系统 sad]]
[I'm so scared QAQ] [[3005 系统 sad]]
"If you could detect subconscious things, you wouldn't be so useless." [[3006 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng replied to the system, but in Liu Guijia's eyes, she was talking to herself. [[3007 旁白 neutral]]
The fear that had already accumulated completely overflowed. [[3008 旁白 neutral]]
She widened her eyes, pointing a trembling finger at Chi Xiaocheng in horror, and even ignoring the pain in her leg, she whispered, "Crazy... crazy..." [[3009 刘桂嘉 sad]]
What kind of inexplicable words was she saying? [[3010 旁白 neutral]]
"So she's already crazy, no wonder... no wonder..." [[3011 旁白 neutral]]
"Hahaha, hahahahaha!" Liu Guijia shed tears and burst into laughter, "So she's already crazy, no wonder she's like this, no wonder... hahahahaha..." [[3012 刘桂嘉 happy]]
But in reality, who was the crazy one? [[3013 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps the wild laughter reached outside, and hurried footsteps echoed in the corridor. [[3014 旁白 neutral]]
Her small ears twitched. [[3015 旁白 neutral]]
A strange smile appeared on her lips. [[3016 旁白 neutral]]
She pulled out the knife that was stuck in her leg and patted Liu Guijia's face with her blood-stained hand. [[3017 旁白 neutral]]
The sticky touch brought the laughter to an abrupt halt. [[3018 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng grinned, "Don't be like that. You're the bully, you know~" [[3019 池小橙 neutral]]
The knife was placed in her hand. [[3020 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng suddenly lay down to the side. [[3021 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang—" [[3022 旁白 neutral]]
Her tea-colored hair spread out as she fell into the warm crimson. [[3023 旁白 neutral]]
And Liu Guijia knelt before her, rigidly holding the small knife in both hands. [[3024 旁白 neutral]]
Her face was filled with horror. [[3025 旁白 neutral]]
Even the gloomy-faced follower squatting behind her was full of doubt. [[3026 旁白 neutral]]
Doubting Chi Xiaocheng's actions. [[3027 旁白 neutral]]
Why would she do this? [[3028 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, her doubts were answered. [[3029 旁白 neutral]]
The door, which had been left ajar, was suddenly kicked open. [[3030 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng! What happened?!" [[3031 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao panted slightly. After getting out of the elevator, she heard an inexplicable laugh. At first, she thought someone was having a fit, but then she realized it was coming from Chi Xiaocheng's suite. [[3032 旁白 neutral]]
And the voice was strangely familiar. [[3033 旁白 neutral]]
She rushed over without stopping, and the sight that greeted her made her pupils contract. [[3034 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was facing away from her, lying in a pool of crimson, and directly in front of her, Liu Guijia was holding a small knife, her gaze eerily directed towards them. [[3035 旁白 neutral]]
Far behind, there was also a girl with hair almost covering her face, squatting, her eyes seemingly radiating adoration. [[3036 旁白 neutral]]
Anyone who didn't know the situation would misunderstand this scene. [[3037 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was no exception. [[3038 旁白 neutral]]
She clenched her fists and stepped forward, "Liu Guijia, what did you do to Xiaocheng?!" [[3039 苏桃 angry]]
Liu Guijia's eyes widened, and with a "clatter," she dropped the knife, backing away in fear, "I... I didn't do anything. It was all Chi Xiaocheng. It was all her!" [[3040 刘桂嘉 sad]]
"Do you think I'll believe you?" [[3041 苏桃 angry]]
"What can I do if you don't believe me!" Liu Guijia shrieked, "She's like this herself, she's staging it, she's crazy, what does it have to do with me..." [[3042 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Su Tao took three steps in two. [[3043 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang—!" [[3044 旁白 neutral]]
A punch knocked Liu Guijia over. [[3045 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahhhhhh!" [[3046 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Su Tao ignored Liu Guijia's cries. [[3047 旁白 neutral]]
She knelt down in distress, disregarding the mess, and tried to help Chi Xiaocheng up. [[3048 旁白 neutral]]
But the moment she saw her face, her pupils contracted again. [[3049 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's voice was filled with suppressed anger, "Liu Guijia, if anything happens to Xiaocheng, you..." [[3050 苏桃 angry]]
"Crazy, they're all crazy!" [[3051 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Before she could finish, Liu Guijia covered her head and fled towards the door. [[3052 旁白 neutral]]
"Hiss—" Su Tao made a move to stop her, but her rationality forced her to calm down. [[3053 旁白 neutral]]
A faint voice came from beside her, "Um, should we call an ambulance first?" [[3054 旁白 neutral]]
It was the gloomy-faced girl. [[3055 旁白 neutral]]
After saying that, she followed Liu Guijia's footsteps and quickly left the room. [[3056 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao remained silent, then quickly took out her phone, "Hello, Dongfang Yang? Can you send your doctor over?" [[3057 苏桃 neutral]]
"The address is... Xiaocheng's house." [[3058 苏桃 neutral]]
