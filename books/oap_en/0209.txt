Chapter 209: Even If It's Ten Years, I'm Willing to Wait for Her [[18268 旁白 neutral]]
[Because they learned that the host had come back from the dead, many characters were moved and had different emotional reactions.] [[18269 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points from Chu Lingfeng +89...] [[18270 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points from Brother Long +177...] [[18271 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points from Dongfang Yang +250...] [[18272 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points from Chi Song +435...] [[18273 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points from Su Tao +520...] [[18274 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points from Si Chen +1...] [[18275 系统 neutral]]
Everyone who learned she had gone from "dead" to "alive," especially those told by Su Tao, provided a corresponding amount of Emotion Points, though the form of their emotional feedback differed. [[18276 旁白 neutral]]
For Chi Xiaocheng, this was an unexpected windfall. [[18277 旁白 neutral]]
Adding this to the previous two thousand Emotion Points, she now undoubtedly had enough funds to buy the poison apple! [[18278 旁白 neutral]]
What surprised her even more was that Su Tao had provided the most Emotion Points of anyone. [[18279 旁白 neutral]]
She had thought that the Emotion Points provided by Su Tao would only decrease from now on. [[18280 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, the System explained. [[18281 旁白 neutral]]
[The female lead, Su Tao, had only grown accustomed and numb to the pressure and the frightening yandere aspects you provided. Therefore, no matter how much more pressure you put on her, her resistance meant she wouldn't provide many Emotion Points.] [[18282 系统 neutral]]
[However, for emotions beyond that, such as liking, love, happiness, and joy, she had not accepted them before, let alone gotten used to them. So, she will still provide a normal amount of Emotion Points.] [[18283 系统 neutral]]
[And there is one more crucial point.] [[18284 系统 neutral]]
[She is the one who, out of everyone, wished for you, the host, to live the most.] [[18285 系统 neutral]]
This had nothing to do with character weight. [[18286 旁白 neutral]]
This feeling even surpassed that of her own brother, Chi Song. [[18287 旁白 neutral]]
"520, huh..." Chi Xiaocheng wanted to smile happily, but only her consciousness could communicate with the System. "I like this number." [[18288 池小橙 happy]]
"But Taotao, even if you try to please me like this, I won't be moved, you know." [[18289 池小橙 neutral]]
Your possessiveness towards me isn't enough if it's just at a passing grade. [[18290 旁白 neutral]]
She was moved to a better hospital room. Because she wanted to know Su Tao's reaction, her consciousness didn't return to the scarecrow for the time being. [[18291 旁白 neutral]]
After composing herself, Su Tao waited patiently with Chu Lingfeng. [[18292 旁白 neutral]]
The man touched his half-bandaged ear and said to Su Tao, "Miss Su Tao, congratulations. It seems your sister's condition improved without me needing to do anything." [[18293 楚凌风 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded happily. "Thank you. I didn't expect Xiaocheng to wake up so suddenly. I couldn't control my emotions just now and lost my composure." [[18294 苏桃 happy]]
"I'm a doctor, I understand how you feel." Chu Lingfeng nodded lightly, but then his tone changed. "However..." [[18295 楚凌风 neutral]]
Once Su Tao's gaze was on him, he continued, "I don't really agree with that professor's claim that she'll wake up in a week or two. I've seen many people on the brink of death. Without proper measures, it would take at least a year and a half for your sister to wake up." [[18296 楚凌风 neutral]]
"It's okay." Su Tao still had a happy, gentle smile. "I can wait a year and a half, or even five or ten years. I'm just so happy that she can wake up at all." [[18297 苏桃 happy]]
She didn't dare to ask for too much. [[18298 旁白 neutral]]
It was already a miracle that she could come back to her. [[18299 旁白 happy]]
She could wait, no matter how long it took. [[18300 旁白 happy]]
If Xiaocheng woke up next week, she would confess everything to her, tell her she loved her, and say all the things she most wanted to hear. [[18301 旁白 happy]]
If Xiaocheng woke up in a year, she would wait, learning all the things she liked and had hoped for, ready to welcome her when she woke. [[18302 旁白 happy]]
If it took ten years for Xiaocheng to wake up, she would work hard, buy a house, a car, and everything else, so that when she woke up, she wouldn't have to worry about anything in life. [[18303 旁白 happy]]
No matter how long, she could wait. [[18304 旁白 happy]]
This was so much better than the darkness filled with despair, wasn't it? [[18305 旁白 happy]]
However, this wasn't the answer Chu Lingfeng wanted. He prompted, "That may be true, but it would be better if she woke up sooner, right?" [[18306 楚凌风 neutral]]
"Of course." [[18307 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao nodded firmly. [[18308 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng seized the opportunity. "Although she's already woken up, I can still check on her condition. My Taiyi Thirteen Needles can cure all sorts of illnesses; it's not just for pulling people back from the brink of death." [[18309 楚凌风 neutral]]
"For you, I'm willing to expend my true qi and perform acupuncture on your sister!" [[18310 楚凌风 neutral]]
After saying this, Chu Lingfeng raised his head confidently. [[18311 旁白 neutral]]
Not only did he increase his favorability with Miss Su Tao. [[18312 旁白 neutral]]
He also got an excuse to be alone in a room with her sister. [[18313 旁白 neutral]]
It was killing two birds with one stone! [[18314 旁白 neutral]]
The threat Chi Xiaocheng posed was still too great. [[18315 旁白 neutral]]
Whether she was a person or a ghost, Chu Lingfeng couldn't let her remain! [[18316 旁白 angry]]
Regardless of what happened at the birthday banquet, the body lying on this hospital bed might be her true form. [[18317 旁白 neutral]]
As long as he destroyed this body, even if she was a ghost, her spiritual energy would probably be greatly damaged, right? [[18318 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng didn't know if his guess was correct, but doing nothing was no different from waiting to die. [[18319 旁白 neutral]]
However, Su Tao's reply was once again unexpected. [[18320 旁白 neutral]]
The moon-like young woman said with concern, "That's not necessary. I was going to ask for your help, Dr. Chu, if Xiaocheng hadn't woken up. But since she has, there's no need to trouble you." [[18321 苏桃 neutral]]
"No..." Chu Lingfeng was at a loss for words. "I can help her recover better." [[18322 楚凌风 neutral]]
"But wouldn't you have to use your true qi? Although what you said sounds mysterious, that must be bad for your health, right?" [[18323 苏桃 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng wanted to slap himself for needing to show off by mentioning "true qi." [[18324 旁白 angry]]
Great. Now, without a chance to use his skills, he couldn't be alone with her. [[18325 旁白 angry]]
If he couldn't even be alone with her, how could he make his move? [[18326 旁白 angry]]
He was anxious, but Su Tao didn't want to talk to him anymore, happily chatting with people on WeChat. [[18327 旁白 neutral]]
This left Chu Lingfeng feeling helpless. [[18328 旁白 neutral]]
I'm a genius doctor, and you're just going to ignore me? [[18329 旁白 angry]]
However, even though he wanted to win over Su Tao, he knew now wasn't the time. Her entire focus was probably on this ghost of a sister. [[18330 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed his chances would only improve if this ghost sister died. [[18331 旁白 neutral]]
Before long, Dongfang Yang also rushed over. After seeing Su Tao on the fifth floor, he quickly asked, "How is Chi Xiaocheng?" [[18332 东方阳 neutral]]
"Professor Su said she's fine now. Her heart has started beating again, and her body is functioning. She's being moved to another room now." [[18333 苏桃 happy]]
After speaking, Su Tao gave a very sincere bow. "Thank you, Dongfang Yang." [[18334 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's awakening was closely related to him. [[18335 旁白 neutral]]
If he hadn't stopped her, Su Tao would have had Chi Xiaocheng cremated long ago. [[18336 旁白 neutral]]
If that had happened, she probably would have had no way to apologize other than to die with Xiaocheng. [[18337 旁白 sad]]
Faced with the young woman's gratitude, Dongfang Yang shyly turned aside and scratched his head. "It was nothing. After all, Chi Xiaocheng is... uh, she's my employee. It's only right to take care of her, so people don't say I'm a ruthless boss." [[18338 东方阳 neutral]]
The two of them chatted happily like a brother and sister while waiting for news from Professor Su. [[18339 旁白 happy]]
This made Chu Lingfeng, standing to the side, feel even more awkward. [[18340 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't get a word in with Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng. [[18341 旁白 sad]]
Now, with Su Tao and Dongfang Yang, he felt like a clown, just standing there foolishly. [[18342 旁白 sad]]
I'm a genius doctor, can't you show me some respect! [[18343 旁白 angry]]
You all deserve to die! [[18344 旁白 angry]]
His expression, hidden beneath his bangs as he lowered his head, gradually became twisted. [[18345 旁白 angry]]
