Chapter 168: Destiny Favors Tao [[14680 旁白 neutral]]
Her once bright, sweet, and charming voice was now hoarse and frantic. [[14681 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao seemed possessed by the dark version of Chi Xiaocheng. Although she stood straight, her posture looked slightly twisted at first glance. [[14682 旁白 neutral]]
With every step she took toward Ye Liang, she asked a question. [[14683 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang, can you tell me where Xiaocheng went?" [[14684 苏桃 angry]]
"What do you mean Xiaocheng is cute? Did I say you could call her cute?" [[14685 苏桃 angry]]
"Why do you say Xiaocheng is yours? Isn't it obvious that she's mine?" [[14686 苏桃 angry]]
"Xiaocheng is mine!" [[14687 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao stopped five meters away from Ye Liang, releasing days of pent-up emotion as tears streamed down her face. [[14688 旁白 neutral]]
"Why did you take my Xiaocheng away!" [[14689 苏桃 angry]]
"It's all your fault, all your fault, all your fault, all your fault!" [[14690 苏桃 angry]]
"I want you to die with Xiaocheng!" [[14691 苏桃 angry]]
Watching the completely crazed Su Tao, Ye Liang swallowed hard, and his legs felt weak. [[14692 旁白 neutral]]
"She's crazy, this girl is completely crazy!" [[14693 叶良 sad]]
More importantly, he couldn't beat her! [[14694 旁白 neutral]]
The adrenaline rush lasted only a moment. Now, Ye Liang just felt his strength fading. If this continued, he might really be killed by her! [[14695 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang bit his tongue hard and tried one last time to communicate, "Su Tao, let me explain, I..." [[14696 叶良 sad]]
Before he could finish, Su Tao cut him off, "What else is there to explain? Can you bring my Xiaocheng back?" [[14697 苏桃 angry]]
"Answer me!" [[14698 苏桃 angry]]
As soon as Su Tao finished speaking, she charged at Ye Liang again! [[14699 旁白 neutral]]
It was manageable in the room, but now on the rooftop, the ice-cold swimming pool was right behind Ye Liang. If he fell in with his injuries, he would surely die quickly. [[14700 旁白 neutral]]
What about to the side or outwards? [[14701 旁白 neutral]]
How could he get down safely from a 34-story building? [[14702 旁白 neutral]]
He had no way to retreat. [[14703 旁白 neutral]]
Realizing this, Ye Liang suddenly burst into laughter, "Su Tao, if that's the case, then come at me! We can just die together!" [[14704 叶良 angry]]
This wasn't the first time he had faced such a crisis. [[14705 旁白 neutral]]
He grew up in a large family and was a high-ranking young master. [[14706 旁白 neutral]]
Many people wanted him dead to seize his family's assets. [[14707 旁白 neutral]]
But every time he was in mortal danger, some accident would allow him to narrowly escape. [[14708 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang knew that his luck was extraordinary. [[14709 旁白 neutral]]
He even once thought that he was the kind of person described as a protagonist in a novel. [[14710 旁白 neutral]]
This was the source of his confidence and arrogance since childhood. [[14711 旁白 neutral]]
In the grand scheme of things, fate was protecting him. [[14712 旁白 neutral]]
"Die?" [[14713 叶良 angry]]
"How could I, Ye Liang, die in a place like this, at the hands of a woman!" [[14714 叶良 angry]]
At that moment, he let go of his fear of death. He stopped clutching the wound on his stomach and charged at Su Tao like a wild beast. [[14715 旁白 neutral]]
He believed his luck would favor him in this crisis too! [[14716 旁白 neutral]]
He reached out to grab the fruit knife from Su Tao, willing to risk further injury. [[14717 旁白 neutral]]
He was trying to repeat what happened in a past crisis! [[14718 旁白 neutral]]
Back then, he was also pushed into a corner like now. He had desperately tried to snatch his enemy's weapon, thinking he would die for sure. [[14719 旁白 neutral]]
But then his enemy's hand suddenly cramped, and they couldn't hold the knife. He snatched it and successfully killed them. [[14720 旁白 neutral]]
From that moment on, he knew. [[14721 旁白 neutral]]
Destiny was on his side! [[14722 叶良 happy]]
His fingers formed a claw, ready to snatch the knife! [[14723 旁白 neutral]]
Like a beast's final struggle, Ye Liang was so fierce that he completely ignored his injuries. [[14724 旁白 neutral]]
But he never expected that the successful knife grab from his ideal script didn't happen. [[14725 旁白 neutral]]
The fruit knife in Su Tao's hand seemed to have a life of its own. With a flick of her wrist, she easily dodged Ye Liang's grab. Using his forward momentum, the knife began to move up his arm. [[14726 旁白 neutral]]
It was like peeling an apple. [[14727 旁白 neutral]]
In a full circle, the clothes on Ye Liang's arm were torn, revealing deep cuts in his skin underneath! [[14728 旁白 neutral]]
The sharp fruit knife, controlled by the young woman, moved from bottom to top. With a "zheng" sound, an ear flew into the air and fell into the pool behind him. [[14729 旁白 neutral]]
With a "dong" sound, cold water splashed. [[14730 旁白 neutral]]
It also extinguished Ye Liang's confidence. [[14731 旁白 neutral]]
"Destiny... isn't on my side?" [[14732 叶良 sad]]
Ye Liang's pupils contracted. The intense pain from his arm left him no time to think. Su Tao's next strike seemed imminent, and he scrambled and dove to the side. [[14733 旁白 neutral]]
His earlier arrogance was completely gone. [[14734 旁白 neutral]]
"How... how could this be? Impossible!" [[14735 叶良 sad]]
"Why... why is it different from before?" [[14736 叶良 sad]]
"Damn it, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts so much!" [[14737 叶良 sad]]
He clutched his arm in pain, then his ear, his face twisted in agony. [[14738 旁白 neutral]]
A "thud" was heard. [[14739 旁白 neutral]]
In his view, a long boot stepped onto the floor, and a long leg walked towards him. [[14740 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang, lying on the ground, looked up in terror. He saw Su Tao holding the blood-stained knife with a blank expression. Her face was speckled with red, like a flower blooming妖艳ly after being nourished. [[14741 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, Ye Liang didn't know why destiny wasn't on his side. Even if his male lead halo was still there, even if he hadn't eaten the poisoned apple, he was no match for Su Tao. [[14742 旁白 neutral]]
There were many male leads in the book; he was just one of them. [[14743 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao was the only female lead in the original story. [[14744 旁白 neutral]]
The once high-and-mighty CEO was scared. He lay on the ground like a dog, his face covered in snot and tears. He cried out miserably, "Please, Su Tao, I was wrong, I was wrong! Please let me go! I won't oppose you anymore. I... I can give you a lot of money. I have many properties in Jiuzhou City. I can give you anything you want!" [[14745 叶良 sad]]
Su Tao walked up to Ye Liang and looked down at him. "Anything?" [[14746 苏桃 neutral]]
Ye Liang's face lit up with joy, and he crawled to Su Tao's side. "Yes, anything! I can give you whatever you want!" [[14747 叶良 happy]]
The pathetic man reached out to hug Su Tao's leg, but in the next second, she kicked him away forcefully! [[14748 旁白 neutral]]
"The Xiaocheng I want is never coming back!" [[14749 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao walked toward Ye Liang, who was clutching his stomach and curled up on his knees in pain. There was no pity in her eyes. [[14750 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, her eyes had lost all reason. [[14751 旁白 neutral]]
A voice in her head seemed to be constantly urging her on. [[14752 旁白 neutral]]
"Kill him, kill him!" [[14753 旁白 neutral]]
"He's the one who killed Xiaocheng! Kill him and avenge her!" [[14754 旁白 neutral]]
She twirled the fruit knife in her hand and raised it high. [[14755 旁白 neutral]]
The moonlight glinted on the blade. [[14756 旁白 neutral]]
This strike was aimed at Ye Liang's head. [[14757 旁白 neutral]]
However, just as Su Tao was about to bring the knife down, a heart-stopping sense of crisis made her stop her hand. [[14758 旁白 neutral]]
It was her body's instinct to resist. [[14759 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if it was telling her that not only would this strike fail, but she might even get hurt herself. [[14760 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, with a "bang," the closed door to the rooftop was pushed open forcefully. [[14761 旁白 neutral]]
A one-armed man walked in with a grim expression. With each step, the moon in the sky seemed to dim a little. [[14762 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was drawn by the sound behind her. The moment she turned her head, her expression became one of extreme shock. [[14763 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother Chi Song?!" [[14764 苏桃 neutral]]
