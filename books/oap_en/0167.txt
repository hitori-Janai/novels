Chapter 167: Su Tao Turned Yandere? (Bonus chapter for Gossip Master) [[14589 旁白 neutral]]
Standing behind the sofa, Ye Liang looked down on Su Tao, who was struggling in front of it with a terribly pale face. A victorious smile appeared on his face. [[14590 旁白 neutral]]
In his eyes, Su Tao was kneeling helplessly before him. [[14591 旁白 neutral]]
She was powerless to avenge Chi Xiaocheng, and soon, she would even lose herself. [[14592 旁白 neutral]]
Speaking of Chi Xiaocheng, Ye Liang couldn't help but lick his lips. [[14593 旁白 neutral]]
He stared at Su Tao, wanting to crush her spirit with his words. "Su Tao, you and Chi Xiaocheng are best friends. I heard you even sleep together. You must know how soft and sweet-smelling she is, right?" [[14594 叶良 angry]]
"Tsk, tsk. If I had known how cute Chi Xiaocheng was without makeup, I wouldn't have ignored her like before." [[14595 叶良 angry]]
"She confessed her love for me so earnestly. If I had just beckoned, she probably would have climbed into my bed." [[14596 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang sighed, "It's such a shame to think about it now. I never got to taste such a top-quality little loli." [[14597 叶良 sad]]
"But, getting a taste of you wouldn't be so bad either." [[14598 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang no longer hid his intentions. His gaze on Su Tao was full of aggression, and he also noticed the murderous look in her eyes. [[14599 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng is mine!" [[14600 苏桃 angry]]
As Su Tao said those words, she suddenly pulled her hand out from deep within the sofa. [[14601 旁白 neutral]]
As she pulled it out, her arm was cut by the spring wires inside the sofa! [[14602 旁白 neutral]]
A long, thin cut from her index finger to her forearm oozed red blood, which dripped down from her fingertips. [[14603 旁白 neutral]]
The cold blade was gradually stained with drops of red, sticky blood that gathered at its tip. [[14604 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stood up straight. Her long hair covered half of her face, and beneath her bangs, her eyes seemed to glow with a sharp, red light. [[14605 旁白 neutral]]
The wind blew her hair, and the cold breeze from the balcony flapped her black coat, making a rustling sound. [[14606 旁白 neutral]]
"Drip, drop!" [[14607 旁白 neutral]]
A drop of red blood fell from the tip of the blade to the floor. [[14608 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang clutched his head and laughed loudly. "Su Tao, what's the use of saying all this now? Chi Xiaocheng is already dead, and you're the one who caused it. I never cared about that little bitch. Who knew she would take a bullet for you." [[14609 叶良 angry]]
"But it doesn't matter. Since you dared to come to this hotel today, don't even think about leaving alive!" [[14610 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang took his hands away from his face. [[14611 旁白 neutral]]
The half of his face that had been burned was now bright red, with the skin twisted together, looking hideous and terrifying. [[14612 旁白 neutral]]
If it wasn't treated now, his face would surely be disfigured. [[14613 旁白 neutral]]
But Ye Liang didn't care at all. With a greedy look in his eyes, he walked around the sofa and moved toward Su Tao. [[14614 旁白 neutral]]
Tears streamed down the face of the girl holding the knife. [[14615 旁白 sad]]
She whispered, "Yes, Xiaocheng died because of me. I'm the one who killed her..." [[14616 苏桃 sad]]
"But if it weren't for you, Ye Liang!" Su Tao looked up, gripping the fruit knife tightly. "If it weren't for you, Xiaocheng wouldn't have died!" [[14617 苏桃 angry]]
I will regret this for the rest of my life. [[14618 苏桃 sad]]
But before that, you must die! [[14619 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao suddenly rushed forward. Even without Chi Xiaocheng's "darkening" skill, her rested body was still incredibly powerful! [[14620 旁白 neutral]]
The small knife seemed to have a soul of its own. The moment she got close to Ye Liang, it seemed to guide her hand, stabbing straight for his heart. [[14621 旁白 neutral]]
But Ye Liang was no pushover. [[14622 旁白 neutral]]
A smirk flashed across his lips. [[14623 旁白 neutral]]
"You don't really think you can beat me, do you?" [[14624 叶良 angry]]
A girl defeating me, a 1.8-meter-tall adult man? [[14625 叶良 angry]]
What a joke. [[14626 叶良 angry]]
Not to mention, he had training! [[14627 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the incoming fruit knife, Ye Liang calmly sidestepped and quickly reached out to grab Su Tao's attacking hand. [[14628 旁白 neutral]]
He planned to use the momentum to snatch the knife and pull Su Tao into his arms. [[14629 旁白 neutral]]
Once he had her in his arms, Su Tao would be like a helpless little rabbit. [[14630 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was already starting to imagine tasting Su Tao's soft, pink lips. [[14631 旁白 neutral]]
However... [[14632 旁白 neutral]]
The reason fantasies don't become reality is simply because the word "fantasy" itself is different from reality. [[14633 旁白 neutral]]
The moment he grabbed Su Tao's arm, Ye Liang suddenly felt an immense force! [[14634 旁白 neutral]]
As strong as he was, he couldn't move the delicate arm under Su Tao's sleeve! [[14635 旁白 neutral]]
How could a girl have so much strength! [[14636 叶良 angry]]
Before he could even be shocked, his years of training made him instinctively push Su Tao's hand away. [[14637 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, the fruit knife still tore through his clothes, leaving a red line across his chest. [[14638 旁白 neutral]]
Wincing in pain, Ye Liang shoved Su Tao's shoulder with his other hand, pushing her away. [[14639 旁白 neutral]]
"How is that possible! How do you have so much strength!" [[14640 叶良 angry]]
His pupils contracted in shock. The cut on his chest throbbed with pain, reminding him that the woman before him was dangerous! [[14641 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao just stood there silently, not saying a word back to Ye Liang. [[14642 旁白 neutral]]
She tightened her grip on the fruit knife and walked toward Ye Liang, step by step. [[14643 旁白 neutral]]
"Someone, help! Somebody get in here!" [[14644 叶良 sad]]
Ye Liang backed away, shouting for the bodyguards outside the door. [[14645 旁白 neutral]]
But no one answered him. [[14646 旁白 neutral]]
Forced onto the balcony by Su Tao, his expression turned hideous again. "I refuse to believe that I can't even beat a woman like you!" [[14647 叶良 angry]]
He no longer hesitated and acted decisively! [[14648 旁白 neutral]]
He grabbed a nearby wine bottle and swung it at Su Tao's face. "Just die!" [[14649 叶良 angry]]
However, Su Tao didn't dodge, and her knife continued straight toward Ye Liang's heart. [[14650 旁白 neutral]]
Trading a life for an injury? [[14651 叶良 angry]]
"You're insane!" [[14652 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang didn't dare to make such a trade. He changed his move and blocked the knife with the wine bottle. The immense force once again shook him. [[14653 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of her war-god father, a possibility arose in Ye Liang's mind. [[14654 旁白 neutral]]
"Damn it!" [[14655 叶良 angry]]
He cursed under his breath and moved toward the door after dodging Su Tao's attack. [[14656 旁白 neutral]]
A resentful and chilling voice reached his ears. "Where do you think you're going?" [[14657 苏桃 angry]]
Ye Liang turned his head. Su Tao's hair now covered half her face. Her right arm, sleeve, and the small knife were all stained red. [[14658 旁白 neutral]]
She looked like a complete madwoman. [[14659 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey~ Where is my Xiaocheng?" [[14660 苏桃 angry]]
"Ye Liang, where are you taking my Xiaocheng?" [[14661 苏桃 angry]]
"Give me my Xiaocheng back!" [[14662 苏桃 angry]]
That one look terrified Ye Liang, stripping him of all his earlier arrogance. He scrambled away, looking at his abdomen in horror. [[14663 旁白 neutral]]
"When did..." [[14664 叶良 sad]]
Besides his chest, a large gash had been cut on his abdomen. [[14665 旁白 neutral]]
He had clearly blocked her knife with the wine bottle, so when did his abdomen get injured! [[14666 叶良 sad]]
"Ye Liang, give me my Xiaocheng back!" [[14667 苏桃 angry]]
Behind him, the hoarse and creepy voice came again. [[14668 旁白 neutral]]
Provoked by him, Su Tao seemed to have completely lost her sanity. [[14669 旁白 neutral]]
The fear of death overshadowed the pain in his body. The surge of adrenaline made his breathing quicken as he yanked the door open. [[14670 旁白 neutral]]
The two bodyguards were not outside the door! [[14671 旁白 neutral]]
With Su Tao right behind him, Ye Liang had no time to think and rushed to the elevator. "Hurry... hurry up!" [[14672 叶良 sad]]
Damn it, why is the elevator stuck on the first floor! [[14673 叶良 angry]]
He quickly ran to the stairwell and went straight to the rooftop! [[14674 旁白 neutral]]
The cold wind howled. He clutched his abdomen and watched as the disheveled girl walked out of the doorway, his heart sinking to a new low. [[14675 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey, Ye Liang." [[14676 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao's eyes, not fully covered by her hair, stared intently at Ye Liang. [[14677 旁白 neutral]]
"Where is my Xiaocheng?" [[14678 苏桃 angry]]
