Chapter 74 Accept Her, or Abandon Her [[6468 旁白 neutral]]
This early winter was colder than previous years. [[6469 旁白 neutral]]
Stepping out of the warm, air-conditioned cafe, facing the cold wind and fine snow, even with her hands in her pockets, she couldn't resist the biting damp cold of Jiangnan. [[6470 旁白 neutral]]
But bidding farewell to Chi Xiaocheng and facing the cold wind alone, Su Tao felt a strange sense of ease. [[6471 旁白 neutral]]
Her nerves were too taut. [[6472 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since that scene in the basement, everything seemed to have changed. [[6473 旁白 neutral]]
Her love, her madness, her obsession. [[6474 旁白 neutral]]
The light and shadow from scattered words in conversations gradually overlapped with the rooftop and basement scenes. [[6475 旁白 neutral]]
The taste of orange juice still made her feel nauseous, but her body had unconsciously gotten used to it. [[6476 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was contradictory. [[6477 旁白 neutral]]
When she was indulged, she would show a healing and cute smile, and her dependence was delightful. [[6478 旁白 neutral]]
But her sensitivity far outweighed this cuteness. [[6479 旁白 neutral]]
A movement, a word, or even a glance, would trigger her. [[6480 旁白 neutral]]
She was clearly the one who was seriously ill, and she was the one at fault, but unconsciously, everyone around her sided with her. [[6481 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng, Si Chen, Chen Qian, her roommate, and even Liu Guijia who bullied her. Everyone who knew a part of her relationship with Chi Xiaocheng sided with her. [[6482 旁白 neutral]]
The key was that in their eyes, comparing Ye Liang and Chi Xiaocheng. [[6483 旁白 neutral]]
Gender aside, Chi Xiaocheng's attitude towards Su Tao seemed to completely overwhelm Ye Liang. [[6484 旁白 neutral]]
—Even though she was seriously ill. [[6485 旁白 neutral]]
If it's not Xiaocheng who's wrong, then am I? [[6486 旁白 neutral]]
Pressure, like a large hand, squeezed her neck, tightening little by little, making it difficult for her to breathe, and increasingly painful. [[6487 旁白 neutral]]
Her physical fatigue was relieved, but what about her mental state? [[6488 旁白 neutral]]
Like a thin thread hanging over her head, extremely taut. [[6489 旁白 neutral]]
When normal, Chi Xiaocheng was lively, cute, docile, and refined. [[6490 旁白 neutral]]
She could keenly perceive Su Tao's mood and provide emotional value, making her happy. [[6491 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed perfect and very relaxing, didn't she? [[6492 旁白 neutral]]
But by her side, Su Tao had to constantly keep her nerves taut, pay attention to her words and actions, and constantly think about how to soothe her stress, always ready for her seemingly insecure abrupt questions. [[6493 旁白 neutral]]
Saying things she didn't mean to like her. [[6494 旁白 neutral]]
Not only Chi Xiaocheng, but even her surroundings were putting pressure on her. [[6495 旁白 neutral]]
Her school mentor's overly high expectations, her classmates' enthusiastic affection for her, being praised highly for her beauty, and her every action being watched by numerous students. [[6496 旁白 neutral]]
And working, earning money, studying, living. [[6497 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng exerted the most pressure, but she was also the only one who could relieve it. [[6498 旁白 neutral]]
By her side, she could occasionally recall the past and enjoy peaceful warmth. [[6499 旁白 neutral]]
Cold water cupped in her hands, splashed onto her face. [[6500 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao walked out of the public restroom, feeling much lighter. [[6501 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know how to deal with Chi Xiaocheng, and she didn't dare to truly follow Doctor Cheng's advice to enjoy the yandere. [[6502 旁白 neutral]]
She was afraid, so how could she enjoy it? [[6503 旁白 neutral]]
"Is not dealing with it the best way to deal with it?" [[6504 旁白 neutral]]
The thought of escaping arose in her heart. Su Tao put her slightly reddened hands, numb from the cold, into her pockets and slowly walked towards Chi Xiaocheng. [[6505 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted time to think. [[6506 旁白 neutral]]
But fate had other plans. [[6507 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang arrived. [[6508 旁白 neutral]]
And got into an argument with Chi Xiaocheng. [[6509 旁白 neutral]]
The gleaming small knife emitted a cold light. [[6510 旁白 neutral]]
She hid behind a tree, in the blind spot of their vision, and saw everything clearly. [[6511 旁白 neutral]]
"Tell me~ if I get hurt, or stabbed, who did it?" [[6512 池小橙 neutral]]
"Ye Liang, it just so happens that I can't make Tao Tao stay away from you and hate you. You came... just in time~" [[6513 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice became hoarse and frenzied. [[6514 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao knew that Chi Xiaocheng had entered a yandere state. [[6515 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang had provoked her, and her rationality was gone. [[6516 旁白 neutral]]
Is Xiaocheng waiting for me to appear, then hurt herself, frame Ye Liang, and gain my sympathy? [[6517 旁白 neutral]]
What would happen if I didn't show up? [[6518 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao leaned against the tree, looking up at the sky. Fine snow fell on her lips, bringing a bitter smile. [[6519 旁白 neutral]]
"So that's what Qianqian and Doctor Cheng meant by choice." [[6520 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't a choice between Ye Liang and Chi Xiaocheng. [[6521 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[6522 旁白 neutral]]
—Accept her. [[6523 旁白 neutral]]
Or... [[6524 旁白 neutral]]
—Abandon her. [[6525 旁白 neutral]]
If I just ran away like this, what would become of them? [[6526 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe I shouldn't appear at all. [[6527 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, she always gives such choices. Once is countless times. Just run away. [[6528 旁白 neutral]]
Just run away! [[6529 旁白 neutral]]
Running away would end this painful struggle. [[6530 旁白 neutral]]
Taking a step, Su Tao suddenly stopped. [[6531 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if a voice in her heart was asking her. [[6532 旁白 neutral]]
Do you really want to run away like this? [[6533 旁白 neutral]]
But isn't she your most cherished sister? [[6534 旁白 neutral]]
Isn't she the only one who accompanied you throughout your childhood and supported you in moving forward? [[6535 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, Ye Liang's grim roar came from her ear, "Chi Xiaocheng, are you crazy?!" [[6536 叶良 angry]]
Little time left for choice. [[6537 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao mechanically poked her head out, her pupils suddenly contracting. [[6538 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stood in front of Ye Liang, clutching her abdomen in pain. Crimson blood continuously dripped onto the ground, melting the fine snow. [[6539 旁白 neutral]]
Whether it was intentional by Chi Xiaocheng or the movement was too large, Ye Liang, who was close to her, was inevitably splashed with a lot of crimson. [[6540 旁白 neutral]]
From afar, it really looked like he had acted ruthlessly, intending to leave Chi Xiaocheng in this snowy field forever. [[6541 旁白 neutral]]
The clouds covered the last bit of sun, and gloom climbed onto Ye Liang's face, "You lunatic, do you think you can catch Su Tao like this? With such a frail appearance in front of me, aren't you afraid I'll just kill you right here?!" [[6542 叶良 angry]]
He reached out his hand, seemingly about to snatch the fruit knife from Chi Xiaocheng's hand. [[6543 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's smile became even more eerie, and she was about to speak. [[6544 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, the system's voice sounded in her mind. [[6545 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, calm down. Su Tao is back, watching from the side!] [[6546 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's pupils contracted slightly. The pain, which even the pain reduction skill couldn't completely alleviate, made her even calmer. [[6547 旁白 neutral]]
She had a sudden inspiration and changed her original statement. [[6548 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she glared fiercely at Ye Liang, "Don't think I don't know, Ye Liang. You know Tao Tao's true identity, right? You're approaching her just to use her!" [[6549 池小橙 angry]]
"What are you talking about..." [[6550 叶良 neutral]]
Before he could finish, he was interrupted by Chi Xiaocheng's even more furious voice, "I will never allow you to harm Tao Tao, and I will never allow you to get close to her!" [[6551 池小橙 angry]]
Ye Liang's anger increased, and he sneered, instructing the bodyguard beside him, "Go find Su Tao and stop her. Don't let her come here." [[6552 叶良 angry]]
"As for you, Chi Xiaocheng!" Ye Liang clenched his fist, "Since you want to threaten me with injury so much, I'll let you stay here forever!" [[6553 叶良 angry]]
The furious voice reached Su Tao's ears. [[6554 旁白 neutral]]
She knew she couldn't wait any longer. [[6555 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, is your love really that heavy?" [[6556 苏桃 sad]]
Her chapped lips parted slightly, and Su Tao slowly walked out from behind the tree. [[6557 旁白 neutral]]
As if she had just arrived, her extremely haggard face showed an unusually poor acting. [[6558 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's lips trembled, and she asked softly, "Ye Liang... what are you doing?" [[6559 苏桃 neutral]]
From beginning to end, she had no choice. [[6560 旁白 neutral]]
