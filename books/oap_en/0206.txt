Chapter 206: The Fake Miracle Doctor [[18022 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the room, Si Zhenliu lay on the bed in agony, his face pale and blue. Age spots covered his neck and spread to his chin, looking terrifying. [[18023 旁白 neutral]]
After closing the door and instructing that no one should disturb him for an hour, Chu Lingfeng sat aside with a look of disgust. [[18024 旁白 neutral]]
"Medicine... give me medicine..." [[18025 司镇流 sad]]
Si Zhenliu made a small, begging sound from the bed, his eyes looking like they would pop out of their sockets as he stared at Chu Lingfeng like a demon. [[18026 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Chu Lingfeng had none of his usual gentlemanly grace. Hearing the annoying voice, he walked over and kicked the bed frame. "You old thing, all you do is ask for medicine. You're always causing trouble!" [[18027 楚凌风 angry]]
"What about your promise to connect me with the Dongfang family? It's been two months, and you still have no news!" [[18028 楚凌风 angry]]
He continued fiercely, "You don't have much time left to live, yet you spend all day enjoying yourself instead of getting things done. If I can't connect with the Dongfang family, do you think I'll keep giving you medicine to stay alive?" [[18029 楚凌风 angry]]
Si Zhenliu was having trouble breathing and stammered, "The Dongfang family... Dongfang Yang is in charge now. He's always been close to Second Young Master Si Chen. Even if I want to help you connect with them, I need time!" [[18030 司镇流 sad]]
Chu Lingfeng snorted coldly, "Time? Two months isn't enough? I don't have that much patience!" [[18031 楚凌风 angry]]
Si Zhenliu said, "It will take at least four or five months. Their old master in the capital is also seriously ill in the hospital and about to pass away. They... they don't trust you at all. They've been using the most expensive drugs. But... but there is another way." [[18032 司镇流 sad]]
Si Zhenliu spoke breathlessly, "In Jiuzhou City, Dongfang Yang... Dongfang Yang has an uncle who is also dying. Your medicine... your medicine will surely work on him too. Give me the medicine... after you give me the medicine, I can introduce you!" [[18033 司镇流 sad]]
"Hmph!" Chu Lingfeng touched his bandaged ear, which was missing a half, and his expression turned cold again. [[18034 旁白 angry]]
If this old thing wasn't still useful, he would have kicked him away long ago. [[18035 旁白 angry]]
A week had passed since the birthday banquet. [[18036 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't find the assassin from last time at all. [[18037 旁白 neutral]]
The investigation into Su Tao and the doll was secretly blocked by Si Chen. [[18038 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to get close to Dongfang Yang, but the other party never gave him much of a chance. He even hinted that if Chu Lingfeng wanted to connect with him, he had to prove his skills. [[18039 旁白 neutral]]
The other party was clearly making it known that they would only talk further if they were sure of Chu Lingfeng's medical abilities. [[18040 旁白 neutral]]
Today was a very good opportunity. [[18041 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone knew that Si Zhenliu had suddenly fallen gravely ill and looked like he was dying. [[18042 旁白 neutral]]
Curing him would further expand his own influence. [[18043 旁白 neutral]]
No one knew why Si Zhenliu suddenly became sick, but Chu Lingfeng knew it was because the medicine's effect had worn off. [[18044 旁白 neutral]]
But if he cured him so easily, this old man would clearly not learn his lesson. [[18045 旁白 neutral]]
So he walked over to Si Zhenliu. [[18046 旁白 neutral]]
First, he took out a black pill. [[18047 旁白 neutral]]
Then he took out an injection. [[18048 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the two items, Si Zhenliu's eyes widened, and he struggled, trying to snatch them. [[18049 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng held his head down. Thinking of a beautiful figure, he smiled and said, "This time, I can give you a month's dose, but I have one condition." [[18050 楚凌风 neutral]]
"What condition? Just say it!" Si Zhenliu's tone was urgent, his eyes filled with a fierce desire. "Give me the medicine, and I'll agree to anything!" [[18051 司镇流 sad]]
"I want you to use your family's power to bring Su Tao to me, no matter what it takes." [[18052 楚凌风 neutral]]
Many people hadn't seen Su Tao in person, but her name was well-known in the upper circles of Jiuzhou City. [[18053 旁白 neutral]]
Rumor had it that it was because of her that Ye Liang was killed by a thug from out of town. [[18054 旁白 neutral]]
She was a toxic woman who drove Ye Liang crazy and led to his death. Many who tried to get close to her would become unlucky. [[18055 旁白 neutral]]
What made her even more famous was that at the birthday banquet, Dongfang Yang had publicly announced that Su Tao was his adopted sister. [[18056 旁白 neutral]]
With the Dongfang family backing her, anyone who wanted to get near her had to think about their own standing. [[18057 旁白 neutral]]
Si Zhenliu, who had been excited, fell silent for a moment. [[18058 旁白 neutral]]
But soon, his desire for the drug overcame his reason, and his expression turned ruthless. "Give me the medicine. I want a three-month dose, and I'll help you get that woman!" [[18059 司镇流 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng snorted coldly, "In your dreams. I'll give you one month to bring Su Tao to me, and then I'll give you another three months' worth!" [[18060 楚凌风 angry]]
After speaking, he threw the pill to Si Zhenliu. [[18061 旁白 neutral]]
He treated him like a dog. As Si Zhenliu greedily swallowed it, Chu Lingfeng suddenly gave him the injection. Si Zhenliu's body twitched for a moment. [[18062 旁白 neutral]]
His pale face quickly turned rosy! [[18063 旁白 neutral]]
The terrifying age spots also faded rapidly, and his vitality returned within just three minutes. [[18064 旁白 neutral]]
In a short while, the 73-year-old man became full of life. [[18065 旁白 neutral]]
His voice was a little low, but still trembling, "That Su Tao is not easy to get. Dongfang Yang will definitely keep a close eye on her." [[18066 司镇流 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng said lightly, "That's your problem. If it weren't for my medicine, you'd be dead by now. You're a smart man, old thing, you know what to do." [[18067 楚凌风 neutral]]
Si Zhenliu was silent for a moment before sighing helplessly. [[18068 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng said, "Alright, lie down. I'm going to perform acupuncture now." [[18069 楚凌风 neutral]]
The show had to be convincing. [[18070 旁白 neutral]]
Si Zhenliu took off most of his clothes and lay down again. Chu Lingfeng took out a box of silver needles from his pocket. [[18071 旁白 neutral]]
He inserted them one by one into various acupoints on his body. [[18072 旁白 neutral]]
Then, after some unknown treatment, thin streams of black smoke began to rise slowly from where the needles were inserted. [[18073 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Chi Xiaocheng understood what was going on with Chu Lingfeng. [[18074 旁白 neutral]]
He might have some medical skills, like many old Chinese doctors who could diagnose by observing, listening, smelling, and asking, and also perform acupuncture. [[18075 旁白 neutral]]
But the title of "miracle doctor" and the story of the thirty needles that saved his great-grandmother must have been made up by him. [[18076 旁白 neutral]]
It was unclear what the strange medicine was made of, but based on its effects, it could indeed bring someone back from the brink of death for a short time. [[18077 旁白 neutral]]
If that was the case, how did he cure Su Tao's scarred face in the original novel? [[18078 旁白 neutral]]
Or rather, was he really the one who cured it? [[18079 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had briefly read the plot related to Chu Lingfeng before, but the original book was 4 million words long. He had roughly read the crucial early parts but didn't have enough Emotion Points to continue reading. [[18080 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, he had read less than 1 million words in total. [[18081 旁白 neutral]]
The book was filled with a lot of boring daily life and repetitive face-slapping scenes. It was long and drawn-out, and the content was very watered down. Chi Xiaocheng really got a headache while reading it. [[18082 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking back now, besides this "Miracle Doctor Chu," it was Dongfang Yang's medical team that put in the most effort to treat Su Tao. [[18083 旁白 neutral]]
The original author wrote the plot that way to highlight the strengths of this miracle doctor male lead and mislead the readers. [[18084 旁白 neutral]]
If that was really the case, then there was even less reason to let this guy stick around! [[18085 旁白 neutral]]
But now was clearly not the right time to act. [[18086 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't need to see what happened next. [[18087 旁白 neutral]]
The visiting guests would be shocked to see Si Zhenliu's recovery. With the silver needles and the wisps of black smoke as a backdrop, as long as Si Zhenliu played along, almost all the guests would believe it to be real. [[18088 旁白 neutral]]
The Taiyi Thirteen Needles could bring the dead back to life! [[18089 旁白 neutral]]
Riding Da Wang, Chi Xiaocheng returned home that night before Su Tao got back. [[18090 旁白 neutral]]
And it was on this night that the System gave him another piece of unexpected news. [[18091 旁白 neutral]]
