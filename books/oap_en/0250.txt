Chapter 250: A "Despicable" Promise [[21310 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya, still on the floor, saw Second Master Ye walk in and ignored the pain, scrambling over to him. [[21311 旁白 neutral]]
Like a dog, she complained to Second Master Ye, [[21312 旁白 neutral]]
"Young Master... I... I tested Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng like you said, but... who knew... who knew that Su Tao would refuse to cooperate? She didn't play by the rules and actually dared to hit me!" [[21313 林芳雅 sad]]
Lin Fangya painfully lifted her broken hand, wiping her tears and snot on Second Master Ye. "Young Master, you have to help me! The way Su Tao hit me, she clearly has no respect for you! They got Young Master Ye Liang killed before, and... you might be next!" [[21314 林芳雅 sad]]
When Lin Fangya said this, most people in the room couldn't help but shake their heads secretly. [[21315 旁白 neutral]]
She had gone too far. Even for a pawn, she was far too stupid. [[21316 旁白 neutral]]
Anger had already clouded Lin Fangya's mind. She couldn't think clearly and had only one thought. [[21317 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted Su Tao to die! [[21318 旁白 angry]]
She was already foolish, and her mind was under pressure, her thoughts a mess. [[21319 旁白 neutral]]
After Lin Fangya said this, Second Master Ye couldn't help but show a disgusted expression. Before she could even hug his leg, he kicked her aside. [[21320 旁白 neutral]]
"Stupid woman, stay away from me." [[21321 叶二少 angry]]
After saying that coldly, he instantly put on a smile and looked at the other guests. "My apologies, everyone. One of my dogs was misbehaving and made a scene." [[21322 叶二少 neutral]]
Then, without even glancing at Lin Fangya, he turned to look at Su Tao. [[21323 旁白 neutral]]
He was momentarily impressed by the girl's cool demeanor, then his gaze shifted to Si Chen. "Sorry, Brother Si Chen, for this whole misunderstanding. You know me, I don't intentionally target people." [[21324 叶二少 neutral]]
After speaking, he looked at the Ye family token on the ground in surprise. "I was wondering where this little thing went. So it was stolen." [[21325 叶二少 neutral]]
Si Chen took a step forward, shielding Su Tao behind him. "Second Master Ye, we know each other well enough. There's no need to beat around the bush. Are you trying to test where Dongfang Yang and I stand?" [[21326 司辰 neutral]]
"It seems you've found out some serious things too." Si Chen gave Second Master Ye a meaningful look. "But I'm sorry to disappoint you. I'm not sure about Dongfang Yang, but I, Si Chen, stand with them." [[21327 司辰 neutral]]
Second Master Ye's expression didn't change, and he kept his faint smile. "I said it was a misunderstanding. I wasn't planning to do anything. Miss Su and Miss Chi helped me get rid of that menace Ye Liang. I have one less competitor in the capital, so I couldn't be happier. Why would I target you two?" [[21328 叶二少 neutral]]
"It was this Lin woman acting on her own, trying to use my name. She deserved to be hit." [[21329 叶二少 neutral]]
Su Tao stepped out from the side. "Then, Second Master Ye, can you hand Lin Fangya over to us?" [[21330 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen glanced at Su Tao, wanting to say something, but he remained silent and just nodded at Second Master Ye, showing it was also what he wanted. [[21331 旁白 neutral]]
Second Master Ye sounded regretful. "I'm afraid I can't do that, Miss Su. Lin Fangya used my name like this and embarrassed me. I have to punish her myself. I can't hand her over to you." [[21332 叶二少 neutral]]
Su Tao frowned, her tone cold. "She not only insulted Xiaocheng, but she also hit her." [[21333 苏桃 angry]]
Second Master Ye kept a polite smile. "I am truly sorry. Tomorrow, I will send one of her arms to you, Miss Su. I will also make sure she can never speak again. As for an apology..." [[21334 叶二少 neutral]]
He took a necklace shining with a blue light from his pocket. "How about this as a gift for Miss Su? It's a necklace worth millions, and there are only a few like it in the world." [[21335 叶二少 neutral]]
Without thinking, Su Tao refused immediately. "I don't want the necklace, I..." [[21336 苏桃 angry]]
Before she could finish, Si Chen reached out and stopped her, signaling her not to say more. [[21337 旁白 neutral]]
The other party had no intention of handing over Lin Fangya. [[21338 旁白 neutral]]
Teaching her a lesson and making Second Master Ye back down was already a very good result. [[21339 旁白 neutral]]
Pushing it further would be going too far. [[21340 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, so many people were watching. If it were a normal argument on the street, it would be fine, but every word and action now would spread. [[21341 旁白 neutral]]
After being stopped by Si Chen, Su Tao also realized she had spoken out of turn. [[21342 旁白 neutral]]
She closed her mouth, suppressed her anger, and let Si Chen handle the situation. [[21343 旁白 neutral]]
She turned around and looked at Chi Xiaocheng with concern. "Xiaocheng, let me see your face. Does it hurt? You don't have to cover your mouth, let me wipe the blood for you first." [[21344 苏桃 neutral]]
Just as Su Tao was about to take a tissue from her pocket, Chi Xiaocheng grabbed her hand. [[21345 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm fine~" [[21346 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice was quiet, and only Su Tao could see her clearly. Her crimson eyes even blinked playfully. [[21347 旁白 happy]]
She loosened her hand slightly. There was no mark on her face from being hit. [[21348 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment and looked at the corner of her mouth. "Then this..." [[21349 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled slyly and licked the corner of her mouth with her little pink tongue. "It's cream. There was a small cake next to me just now." [[21350 池小橙 happy]]
So... Xiaocheng did that on purpose just now? [[21351 旁白 neutral]]
Was the goal... to get revenge on Lin Fangya? But how did she know about Lin Fangya? Was it an impulse because she had just been bullied, or... [[21352 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be that Xiaocheng has recovered some of her memories?! [[21353 旁白 neutral]]
While Su Tao felt a little surprised, she couldn't help but look worried. [[21354 旁白 neutral]]
However, it wasn't what she thought. Seeing that everyone's attention was on Si Chen and Second Master Ye's conversation, Chi Xiaocheng grabbed Su Tao's hand. [[21355 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice lost its previous distance and became gentle and dependent. "I knew you still cared about me. I don't know why I felt uncomfortable with you before, but now I understand clearly, Sister Su Tao..." [[21356 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up and met Su Tao's eyes. [[21357 旁白 neutral]]
After a week, she once again called her "Sister Su Tao." [[21358 旁白 happy]]
Then, she smiled. "Thank you for protecting me. From now on, please don't abandon me, okay?" [[21359 池小橙 sad]]
That feeling was really awful. [[21360 旁白 sad]]
It wasn't about the confusing memories she had been given. [[21361 旁白 neutral]]
It was about the feeling before she died. She liked her so much and did everything for her, but she still grew more and more distant. That feeling of being slowly abandoned and ignored. [[21362 旁白 sad]]
It was very painful. [[21363 旁白 sad]]
Oh, Xiaocheng, you're so clever, playing with Tao Tao like this, putting pressure on her to strengthen her feelings. [[21364 旁白 neutral]]
But I can't help it, Tao Tao. I just hope you can like me more, care about me more. [[21365 旁白 sad]]
So, no matter what happens in the future, don't leave me, okay? [[21366 池小橙 sad]]
After a moment of shock, Su Tao was filled with joy and gratitude. [[21367 旁白 happy]]
Xiaocheng, maybe you're only asking me this because you feel insecure from your confused memories. [[21368 旁白 neutral]]
You hope I won't ignore you like what happened in your memories. [[21369 旁白 neutral]]
This memory is wrong. [[21370 旁白 neutral]]
The question is also a coincidence. [[21371 旁白 neutral]]
But my promise is the only one, no matter what your question is or what your memories are. [[21372 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at Chi Xiaocheng with the same seriousness and nodded firmly. "Don't worry, Xiaocheng. I will never abandon you again!" [[21373 苏桃 happy]]
This answer. [[21374 旁白 neutral]]
It was for the past, for the present, and for the future. [[21375 旁白 neutral]]
