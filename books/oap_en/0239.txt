Chapter 239: Who is the Third Person? [[20490 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't know how she fell asleep. She only felt very warm. It was the first time she had slept so peacefully since waking up. [[20491 旁白 neutral]]
Although, when she woke up, her lower back and neck were a bit sore. [[20492 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao held her all night, and she rested in Su Tao's arms. Although she slept, the position was very awkward. [[20493 旁白 neutral]]
As a result, when Dongfang Yang came to visit early in the morning, he found Chi Xiaocheng sitting on the bed, lecturing Su Tao. [[20494 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sat obediently on a chair with her head down, as if ashamed, letting Chi Xiaocheng vent her morning grumpiness. [[20495 旁白 neutral]]
From Dongfang Yang's perspective, Su Tao looked like she was about to start bowing and apologizing profusely. [[20496 旁白 neutral]]
In reality, Su Tao wasn't looking down in shame, but was secretly celebrating, a faint smile on her lips that Chi Xiaocheng didn't notice. [[20497 旁白 neutral]]
Last night... [[20498 苏桃 neutral]]
It's a little embarrassing to talk about. [[20499 苏桃 neutral]]
She had woken up groggy in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep. Chi Xiaocheng was sleeping soundly in her arms, and after some teasing, she found she couldn't wake her, so she... [[20500 旁白 neutral]]
In short, it's hard to describe. I'm sure you are all upstanding people and wouldn't be interested anyway. [[20501 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that they hadn't noticed him, Dongfang Yang knocked on the door and asked, a little confused, "So... are you two doing some kind of role-play?" [[20502 东方阳 neutral]]
As soon as he spoke, Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao noticed the cheerful young man. He had swapped his usual flashy clothes for something more subdued today, a faint grey-black instead of his usual bright red. [[20503 旁白 neutral]]
When he wasn't talking, without his usual goofy tone, he actually had the air of a cold, distant CEO. [[20504 旁白 neutral]]
As if she'd been caught doing something she shouldn't, Su Tao felt a little shy. She tucked her hair behind her ear and said, "It's nothing. I was just helping Xiaocheng get ready, and I didn't do a very good job." [[20505 苏桃 neutral]]
"Oh, so that's it. I'm happy to see that you've cleared up your misunderstanding." [[20506 东方阳 happy]]
Dongfang Yang walked in with a smile and came over to Chi Xiaocheng's side. Like an older brother scolding his little sister, he said, "But Chi Xiaocheng, as the younger sister, you can't lecture Su Tao like that. Do you understand?" [[20507 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng rolled her eyes at Dongfang Yang, barely stopping herself from calling him an idiot. [[20508 旁白 neutral]]
But I have to play my part. [[20509 池小橙 neutral]]
After being held by Taotao all night, my mixed-up memories mean my affection for her isn't that high. I have to be a little grumpy! [[20510 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng dropped the "what an idiot" look and gave Dongfang Yang a sweet smile instead. [[20511 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was sitting closer to the door, while Dongfang Yang stood by the window. At that moment, sunlight streamed in, illuminating the side of their faces. [[20512 旁白 neutral]]
Both of them had faint smiles. [[20513 旁白 neutral]]
The warm and beautiful scene looked like an interaction between siblings, or maybe... [[20514 旁白 neutral]]
A couple. [[20515 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, who had been feeling secretly pleased, suddenly felt as if she'd been plunged into icy water, cold to the bone. [[20516 苏桃 sad]]
That's right. Just because I tricked my way into having Xiaocheng for one night and she was a little grumpy but not really mad at me... what's there to be so happy about? [[20517 苏桃 sad]]
When I get close to her, Xiaocheng still feels a bit uncomfortable. [[20518 苏桃 sad]]
She didn't know why, but she could see the gap between them from the smile Chi Xiaocheng showed Dongfang Yang. [[20519 旁白 sad]]
She could still feel a clear sense of distance. [[20520 旁白 sad]]
Last night, they had talked for a long time, and they had interacted this morning. [[20521 苏桃 neutral]]
It all seemed normal, right? [[20522 苏桃 neutral]]
But Su Tao hadn't heard the "Taotao" she longed to hear. [[20523 苏桃 sad]]
She hadn't even heard a single "Sister Su Tao." [[20524 苏桃 sad]]
It was all "hey" and "you" to start a sentence. [[20525 旁白 neutral]]
Using such a despicable method only resulted in self-pity and hollow comfort. [[20526 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng hadn't even fully recovered, and I made her sleep poorly all night. Now her neck and body are sore. [[20527 苏桃 sad]]
"Su Tao, what's wrong?" [[20528 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's question came from beside her. [[20529 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly looked up and forced a smile. "What's wrong? I'm fine!" [[20530 苏桃 neutral]]
The smile slowly stiffened. [[20531 旁白 neutral]]
That's right, I'm fine. [[20532 苏桃 neutral]]
Anyway, Dongfang Yang is so naive, he only sees Xiaocheng as a sister. [[20533 苏桃 neutral]]
You have to take things one step at a time. [[20534 苏桃 neutral]]
At least now I can take care of Xiaocheng, feed her breakfast, peel fruit for her, and sit with her to chat. [[20535 苏桃 neutral]]
After she finished her own breakfast, Su Tao eagerly asked Dr. Cheng. [[20536 旁白 neutral]]
We've already cleared up the misunderstanding, so why does Xiaocheng still feel uncomfortable with me? That sense of distance is always there. [[20537 苏桃 sad]]
Dr. Cheng replied, "It's a lingering issue from her amnesia. Although you've resolved the misunderstanding, in her jumbled memories, you may have still caused her significant harm. This 'resolution' is likely just a hope based on your past relationship." [[20538 成医生 neutral]]
"More importantly, it's probably the pain that occurred before she lost her memory. She doesn't want to endure that pain, so her brain subconsciously forgot it. The blank space in her memory needed to be filled, which led to the memory confusion." [[20539 成医生 neutral]]
"But you must understand, a person's subconscious and memory aren't that simple. It's not like she lost her memory and now she's a blank slate who will believe anything." [[20540 成医生 neutral]]
"Her ability to think for herself is still there. Habits, subconscious actions, and thoughts from before the amnesia will still show up in her daily life." [[20541 成医生 neutral]]
"She feels uncomfortable around you, probably because her subconscious wants to avoid the pain that caused the amnesia." [[20542 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "In other words, her subconscious is avoiding you, afraid you will bring more pain, which has created this rejection and annoyance." [[20543 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao never imagined that could be the reason. [[20544 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly asked, "So what's the solution?" [[20545 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "You'll probably have to ask a more professional psychologist about that. My advice is to be even more meticulous in your daily care for her and go along with her wishes. You understand the idea of 'love grows over time,' right?" [[20546 成医生 neutral]]
"Lower all her defenses, make her believe that you will never hurt her, no matter what. That's the only way to dispel the subconscious fear." [[20547 成医生 neutral]]
"Or, awaken all her memories." [[20548 成医生 neutral]]
After he finished, Su Tao fell silent, still holding her phone. [[20549 旁白 neutral]]
"Awaken her memories..." [[20550 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed deeply. She wanted to, but she was also a little scared. [[20551 旁白 neutral]]
It's not that I'm afraid of Chi Xiaocheng's yandere side. To awaken those memories, she would have to experience the pain first, before getting to the old memories, right? [[20552 苏桃 neutral]]
After all, the amnesia was caused by that pain. Only by getting through the pain can she remember the good times. [[20553 苏桃 neutral]]
She has to cross that threshold first. [[20554 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao was afraid that Chi Xiaocheng would break down from the painful memories. [[20555 苏桃 sad]]
The ending of the girl in the old man's story was still fresh in her mind. [[20556 旁白 sad]]
At noon, Su Tao was about to go feed Chi Xiaocheng lunch, but when she got to the hospital room, she saw the person she shouldn't hate, but just didn't want to see. [[20557 旁白 neutral]]
—Fang Ning. [[20558 旁白 neutral]]
She usually came in the morning and at noon. I don't know why she didn't come this morning. [[20559 苏桃 neutral]]
But now, she had arrived earlier than me. [[20560 旁白 neutral]]
And... she was feeding Chi Xiaocheng. [[20561 旁白 sad]]
