Chapter 228: Desire and Inner Demons [[19641 旁白 neutral]]
It was also about recovering memories. [[19642 旁白 neutral]]
It was also a form of treatment. [[19643 旁白 neutral]]
Complete amnesia and confused memories were two different things. [[19644 旁白 neutral]]
With the former, maybe she wouldn't be disliked, and she could even tell her many stories from their past from the very beginning. [[19645 旁白 neutral]]
Then, with Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, and others confirming her story, she could take her home and let her hug Da Wang. Wouldn't her feelings return more quickly that way? [[19646 旁白 neutral]]
She could even secretly erase the painful things that had happened, keeping them to herself without letting Xiaocheng know. [[19647 旁白 neutral]]
As these unrealistic thoughts flashed through her mind, Su Tao decided to directly tell Cheng Cheng what she was thinking. [[19648 旁白 neutral]]
But she had just begun when Cheng Cheng quickly sent a message to interrupt her: "Wait a minute, I don't even know how confused Xiaochengzi's memories are. Don't just go on talking by yourself!" [[19649 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao gave an embarrassed laugh, "Sorry, I was a little lost in my own world. Let me tell you." [[19650 苏桃 neutral]]
She retold the story of Chi Xiaocheng's confused memories after waking up, but her mood grew a little lower with each retelling. [[19651 旁白 sad]]
Finally, she admitted that she had thought it would be better if Xiaocheng had complete amnesia instead of just confused memories. [[19652 旁白 sad]]
The words she typed into the chatbox seemed to carry a heavy weight. [[19653 旁白 sad]]
Cheng Cheng was silent for about half a minute before sending a message, "Taozi, you really only think about yourself." [[19654 程程 neutral]]
Taozi replied instantly: "I'm sorry." [[19655 苏桃 sad]]
Cheng Cheng: "Have you considered Xiaochengzi's feelings? If she had complete amnesia, she'd be a blank slate, and you could paint her with any colors you want." [[19656 程程 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng: "You could possess her effortlessly, change her, and fill her mind with the ideas you 'like.' Would that still be Xiaochengzi?" [[19657 程程 neutral]]
Reading the words in the chat, Su Tao's face turned red with shame. [[19658 旁白 neutral]]
Even though the thought had only lasted for a moment, she had still had it. [[19659 旁白 neutral]]
Treating Xiaocheng like that was indeed too selfish. [[19660 旁白 neutral]]
But what Cheng Cheng said next stunned Su Tao. [[19661 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng: "But if I put myself in Xiaochengzi's shoes, I'd actually be pretty happy that you had a thought like that." [[19662 程程 neutral]]
Taozi: "Why?" [[19663 苏桃 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng: "Because it shows you want to possess her. To make her forget everything and then cover that blank canvas with your colors. You wouldn't say something like that if you didn't care about her." [[19664 程程 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng: "From a yandere's perspective, that would definitely be something to like." [[19665 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao stuck out her tongue, "I was just thinking about it. Even if Xiaocheng really had complete amnesia, I wouldn't do that!" [[19666 苏桃 neutral]]
However, Cheng Cheng had reminded her of something. [[19667 旁白 neutral]]
Yandere! [[19668 旁白 neutral]]
The Xiaocheng with confused memories had no memory of being a yandere. [[19669 旁白 neutral]]
This was a point that neither Si Chen nor Dr. Lin had noticed! [[19670 旁白 neutral]]
Would she still become a yandere after "returning to normal" like this? [[19671 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly told her friend Cheng Cheng about this discovery. [[19672 旁白 neutral]]
The reply came: "That's a very good angle to look at it from. In the past two days, have you noticed any other changes in her compared to before?" [[19673 程程 neutral]]
"I mean, changes related to her being a yandere." [[19674 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao recalled the few times she had interacted with Chi Xiaocheng. [[19675 旁白 neutral]]
With her yandere tendencies, it was hard to tell from her appearance if she was about to act out. [[19676 旁白 neutral]]
But there was one thing Su Tao had noticed. [[19677 旁白 neutral]]
Taozi: "Her eyes aren't as strange as before. How should I put it... her gaze has become much clearer and colder. Does that count?" [[19678 苏桃 neutral]]
Although it might have been her imagination. [[19679 旁白 neutral]]
But whenever Chi Xiaocheng had an episode, Su Tao felt that her red eyes were terrifying, and sometimes they would even glow. [[19680 旁白 neutral]]
Now, she didn't get that feeling at all. [[19681 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng thought for a moment, "If the trigger for her yandere behavior before was because of you and Ye Liang, now that Ye Liang is dead, and her appearance after her memory loss shows no signs of it..." [[19682 程程 neutral]]
"Then, Taozi, do you think it's possible that Xiaochengzi... won't have those episodes anymore?" [[19683 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao's pupils contracted as she looked at the small lines of text on the green background. [[19684 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng was like a mind-reading witch, digging out the thoughts from the bottom of her heart and laying them on the table. [[19685 旁白 neutral]]
The text on the green background appeared, one sentence after another. [[19686 旁白 neutral]]
"Think about it from another angle. Because of this memory loss, Chi Xiaocheng is no longer a yandere." [[19687 程程 neutral]]
"Without Ye Liang, she won't repeat what she did before, and won't have an episode because of you." [[19688 程程 neutral]]
"You have to know that without a beginning, all hopes and fantasies are just empty!" [[19689 程程 neutral]]
"Didn't you desperately want to cure her of being a yandere?" [[19690 程程 neutral]]
"You want a perfect Xiaocheng, right?" [[19691 程程 neutral]]
"She is obedient, likes you very much, and affectionately calls you by your favorite nickname. No matter what you say, she obeys you, pampers you, relies on you, and loves you." [[19692 程程 neutral]]
"Even her little tantrums and playful moments would become the spice of your relationship." [[19693 程程 neutral]]
"More importantly, without the yandere side, she would still be as devoted as ever, never leaving you." [[19694 程程 neutral]]
"From now on, you won't be hurt, you won't feel pressured, and you won't have to shout in frustration and pain about what to do. You just need to enjoy her cuteness and love, forever." [[19695 程程 neutral]]
The words on the phone seemed to come to life, slowly drawing out the deepest desires of Su Tao's heart. [[19696 旁白 neutral]]
Or perhaps, her lust. [[19697 旁白 neutral]]
She liked Xiaocheng, but it wasn't just a simple liking. [[19698 旁白 neutral]]
She had been scared, terrified, had run away, and had felt regret. In the last few months, even including this last month of realization... [[19699 旁白 neutral]]
...the pain and pressure Chi Xiaocheng brought her far outweighed the joy and happiness she felt. [[19700 旁白 sad]]
The reason for it all came down to two words—yandere! [[19701 旁白 neutral]]
And now, there was a possibility of getting rid of Xiaocheng's yandere side for good! [[19702 旁白 happy]]
*Ding-dong*, another message from Cheng Cheng arrived. [[19703 旁白 neutral]]
"Taozi, according to what you said earlier, those doctors analyzed that Xiaochengzi doesn't really hate you, and it's more likely that her condition got worse because she was upset, right?" [[19704 程程 neutral]]
"So, isn't it just a matter of time before you two resolve the misunderstanding and make up?" [[19705 程程 neutral]]
"After you make up, you'll have all the time in the world to rebuild your romantic relationship and slowly make her fall in love with you again." [[19706 程程 neutral]]
"Isn't this the exact scene you just imagined? She has complete amnesia and will never become a yandere again." [[19707 程程 neutral]]
"Never becoming a yandere, only bringing you happiness—what a wonderful future that would be!" [[19708 程程 neutral]]
At this moment, Cheng Cheng was like a true devil. [[19709 旁白 neutral]]
Every word she said struck a chord. [[19710 旁白 neutral]]
"Taozi, do you really want Xiaochengzi to get her memories back, and then turn back into that terrifying yandere?" [[19711 程程 neutral]]
