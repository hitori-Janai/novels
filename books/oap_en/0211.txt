Chapter 211: What Should I Do After Confessing? [[18411 旁白 neutral]]
With hope and anticipation, people subconsciously make changes. [[18412 旁白 neutral]]
It's like when a rather introverted person who has been single for over twenty years gets a partner for the first time; they subconsciously want to improve themselves to show a better side of themself. [[18413 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was just like that. [[18414 旁白 neutral]]
Every day, she wanted to improve herself a little more before Chi Xiaocheng woke up. [[18415 旁白 neutral]]
That way, when she woke up, she would see a more perfect version of her. [[18416 旁白 neutral]]
She worked hard to study, exercise, and expand her social circle to enrich her experiences. [[18417 旁白 neutral]]
Every day was a little tiring, but very fulfilling. [[18418 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, she also really wanted to share her joy with someone. [[18419 旁白 happy]]
Dr. Cheng was very busy with work and didn't know that Xiaocheng had actually "died" once. He was like an elder to her, providing help whenever she needed it. [[18420 旁白 neutral]]
Although Su Tao wanted to share this with him, she was always afraid of disturbing his work. [[18421 旁白 sad]]
They had gradually talked less since Chi Xiaocheng passed away. [[18422 旁白 sad]]
She had many other friends, but their relationships were just that—friends. [[18423 旁白 neutral]]
After thinking it over, on Saturday, she finally asked her good friend Chengcheng out. [[18424 旁白 neutral]]
If the girl didn't tie her hair up, Su Tao would always see an illusion of Xiaocheng in her. But after confirming that Xiaocheng would wake up, that illusion was gone when she saw her friend again. [[18425 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng still looked as helpless as she did when they spoke on the phone, "I only have a three-hour break each week, and you're wasting it again." [[18426 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao put her hands together apologetically, "Our relationship is close, but not too close, and we get along the best. It doesn't matter where we go to have fun. It's my treat this time." [[18427 苏桃 happy]]
They were online friends, like soulmates who knew everything about each other but had almost no contact in real life. [[18428 旁白 neutral]]
This sense of distance—somewhat close yet very far—made Su Tao feel relaxed. [[18429 旁白 neutral]]
She was also the only person Su Tao had told that Chi Xiaocheng had died and come back to life. [[18430 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning was an exception. [[18431 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng smiled and said, "Actually, you just don't have many friends, so you have to come to me, right?" [[18432 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled back, "That's not it. It's just that I'm either not that close with them or too close. It's hard to talk about things related to Xiaocheng with some friends." [[18433 苏桃 neutral]]
Chengcheng raised an eyebrow suspiciously, "Then how come I've never heard you mention these other friends?" [[18434 程程 neutral]]
"Everyone has their own social circle, you know." [[18435 苏桃 neutral]]
"But if your Xiaocheng knew you had another social circle, wouldn't she get jealous?" [[18436 程程 neutral]]
Chengcheng's sudden question made Su Tao pause for a moment. [[18437 旁白 neutral]]
The person in front of her was a soulmate and a friend, not Xiaocheng, so there was no need to hide anything. "We're just friends, nothing more. Xiaocheng probably wouldn't get jealous. I just have to show her that I love her." [[18438 苏桃 neutral]]
"And because I was worried about this, I never told Xiaocheng about those things before." [[18439 苏桃 neutral]]
Like Chen Qian and Xiao Wei. [[18440 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was also good friends with them. [[18441 旁白 neutral]]
But she rarely mentioned them to Chi Xiaocheng, afraid of her unstable yandere state. [[18442 旁白 sad]]
However, Chengcheng let out a meaningful "Eng～," "Taozi, you still don't understand yanderes enough. Hiding things from her is also a negative in her book." [[18443 程程 neutral]]
"Maybe we just think about it differently?" Su Tao touched her chin, thinking. "I always thought that as long as I love her and won't betray her, it would be fine." [[18444 苏桃 neutral]]
"Theoretically, that's true, but did you really love her before?" [[18445 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao was speechless for a moment, then glared at her friend, "At least I love her now!" [[18446 苏桃 angry]]
Chengcheng was still a bit curious. [[18447 旁白 neutral]]
"Are you sure?" [[18448 程程 neutral]]
"I'm sure!" [[18449 苏桃 neutral]]
"Even though she's a girl, and you're a girl too?" [[18450 程程 neutral]]
"I..." Su Tao bit her lip and huffed, "It's not like that's impossible. Anyway, I'll get used to it and work hard to overcome it!" [[18451 苏桃 neutral]]
She pushed Chengcheng into a bubble tea shop and quickly changed the subject. [[18452 旁白 neutral]]
This friend was great in every way, except that she always teased her for no reason, just like Xiaocheng used to, bringing up sensitive topics as if to deliberately test her feelings. [[18453 旁白 neutral]]
But that's what being friends is all about. [[18454 旁白 happy]]
Thanks to Chengcheng, Su Tao had to face and sort out many topics she would have subconsciously avoided. [[18455 旁白 neutral]]
The two of them walked around for a while and then arrived at Chi Xiaocheng's house. [[18456 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao said, "This is where Xiaocheng and I live. Her brother earned the money for this house, and it's in his name. In the future, I plan to earn money to buy a new one as our little home." [[18457 苏桃 happy]]
Chengcheng kicked away Da Wang, who was trying to get closer, and casually looked at the furnishings, "I think this place is pretty nice. You could just live here in the future." [[18458 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled gently, "It's still her brother's house. He'll need to get married and have kids someday. I want to build my future with Xiaocheng with my own hands." [[18459 苏桃 happy]]
"Oh～" [[18460 程程 neutral]]
Chengcheng looked at Su Tao with a half-smile, "You're already thinking as far ahead as marriage. Tell me, what are your specific plans?" [[18461 程程 neutral]]
As soon as she said that, Su Tao's smile froze. [[18462 旁白 neutral]]
Then her face turned slightly red. [[18463 旁白 neutral]]
"Marriage... I haven't really thought about it." Su Tao sighed, "Actually, I don't know what our future will be like. Although I'm trying to overcome my own awkwardness, as two girls, we can't really be open about our relationship in the future." [[18464 苏桃 sad]]
"I've imagined Xiaocheng waking up ten years from now, but I haven't imagined her in a wedding dress. It's more like I don't dare to think about it." [[18465 苏桃 sad]]
She sat on the sofa, feeling a bit emotional. "Before, I couldn't accept Xiaocheng's yandere side, and I would always wonder if we would have to sneak around for dates if we got together, getting pointed at and gossiped about if we were discovered, and then ending up in the news." [[18466 苏桃 sad]]
"Even online now, there are a lot of people who attack people like us, right?" [[18467 苏桃 sad]]
Chengcheng: "So that's why you kept telling me that you thought two girls being together was strange?" [[18468 程程 neutral]]
"Yeah, that's part of the reason." Su Tao nodded lightly. "Another part is my own values. After all, the education I received growing up never touched on that, so rejecting it was almost subconscious." [[18469 苏桃 neutral]]
"Even now?" [[18470 程程 neutral]]
"If I still felt that way, why would I be telling you so directly that I like Xiaocheng too?" Su Tao shot a look at Chengcheng, annoyed. "I already said, when Xiaocheng wakes up, I'm going to confess to her!" [[18471 苏桃 angry]]
Chengcheng boiled a kettle of water and sat down next to Su Tao. "Have you thought about what happens after the confession? She's a yandere who has gone through death once or twice. What if she becomes even more possessive? What will you do then?" [[18472 程程 neutral]]
These words stunned Su Tao, who was sitting on the sofa. [[18473 旁白 neutral]]
She had thought a lot about what would happen if Xiaocheng died for good, or if she came back to life. [[18474 旁白 neutral]]
The most important thing was to confess to her after she woke up and confirm their relationship as... well, girlfriends. [[18475 旁白 neutral]]
After all, this was Xiaocheng's dying wish. [[18476 旁白 neutral]]
But what about after the confession? [[18477 旁白 neutral]]
How would she handle her yandere nature? [[18478 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao looked at Chengcheng, getting a strange feeling. [[18479 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if Chengcheng was asking this question from Xiaocheng's perspective. [[18480 旁白 neutral]]
