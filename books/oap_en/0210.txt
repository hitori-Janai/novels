Chapter 210: Expectation and Hope. [[18347 旁白 neutral]]
In the new hospital room, Su Tao sat by the bed. She gently held Chi Xiaocheng's right hand, where an IV was attached. [[18348 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't look happy, but more relieved to have survived a close call. [[18349 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to hold that hand tightly and never let go, but she was afraid of hurting her. [[18350 旁白 neutral]]
As Dongfang Yang watched from the side, her endless affection turned into words of love and longing. [[18351 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, you know, I really, really missed you." [[18352 苏桃 sad]]
"From the day you left, I was filled with endless regret. Because of my repeated mistakes, you ended up dying for me." [[18353 苏桃 sad]]
"Every day after that, everyone was doing something for you. Only I was stuck, lost in past memories, both good and bad, unable to face your death." [[18354 苏桃 sad]]
"Do you think I'm useless?" [[18355 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao laughed as she spoke, "I often thought it would have been better if you hadn't taken that bullet for me. I wish I had died instead." [[18356 苏桃 sad]]
"I know I shouldn't think like that. It would make your sacrifice meaningless. But people always have regrets. How could I just forget you and move on?" [[18357 苏桃 sad]]
"Even in my dreams, when I saw you, I was still so helpless that I needed you to comfort me." [[18358 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao spoke with deep love, her eyes fixed on the small face behind the oxygen mask. [[18359 旁白 neutral]]
"But luckily, heaven didn't give up on you. Dongfang Yang and Si Chen never gave up on you. You're still alive, and I can see you again." [[18360 苏桃 happy]]
As she spoke, she became quiet again. [[18361 旁白 neutral]]
They never gave up on you. [[18362 苏桃 neutral]]
But I thought several times about having you cremated, so I could keep you with me forever. [[18363 苏桃 sad]]
Does that count as giving up in a way? [[18364 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao wasn't sure. She just wanted to let out all the feelings of sadness, regret, and apology she had kept inside. [[18365 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment of silence, Su Tao took a soft breath and laughed again, "But you can't hear any of this for now. I really don't want you to see this weak side of me." [[18366 苏桃 sad]]
Her eyes suddenly became serious. [[18367 旁白 neutral]]
"So, when you wake up, I'll hide all my regrets and mistakes in my heart and make it up to you with my actions. So... you have to take care of yourself and get better, okay?" [[18368 苏桃 neutral]]
After she finished, she touched her forehead to Chi Xiaocheng's fingers, feeling her warmth for a moment before gently putting her hand back under the covers. [[18369 旁白 neutral]]
She stood up and wiped the corner of her eye, "Sorry, Dongfang Yang, for letting you see that." [[18370 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's nothing. It would be strange if you didn't react at all." Dongfang Yang stood to the side with his hands in his pockets. His tone was a bit flat, but his eyes held a clear gentleness. [[18371 东方阳 neutral]]
After looking at Chi Xiaocheng's weak and peaceful face for a few seconds, he said to Su Tao, "Let's go. Professor Su said to keep her environment quiet and not to disturb her too much." [[18372 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded lightly, "Okay, but is there nothing you want to say to Xiaocheng?" [[18373 苏桃 neutral]]
"What is there to say?" Dongfang Yang turned his face away and huffed, "She still owes me twenty thousand yuan. I won't let her keep pretending to be asleep." [[18374 东方阳 angry]]
His somewhat arrogant expression and firm tone made Su Tao laugh. [[18375 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was embarrassed. "What's... what's so funny!" [[18376 东方阳 angry]]
"I told you, acting cold doesn't suit you." Su Tao walked towards the door and smiled at him, "But you looked pretty convincing acting like a domineering CEO just now. Thank you for caring about Xiaocheng so much." [[18377 苏桃 happy]]
With that, she walked out of the room first. [[18378 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving Dongfang Yang standing there in a daze, her light smile lingering in his mind. [[18379 旁白 neutral]]
"What does she mean by 'convincing'? I'm not wearing any cologne. Is she talking about my natural manly scent?" [[18380 东方阳 neutral]]
"She likes my manly scent?" [[18381 东方阳 happy]]
"In other words, she likes me!" [[18382 东方阳 happy]]
Dongfang Yang rubbed his nose and walked out with a silly smile. [[18383 旁白 neutral]]
... [[18384 旁白 neutral]]
Three days passed in a flash. After hearing the news that Chi Xiaocheng had "woken up" and was "recovering from a serious illness," many people who knew her came to visit. [[18385 旁白 neutral]]
The most frequent visitor was naturally Su Tao. Every evening after she got off work from the cafe, she would come to the hospital and sit there. [[18386 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes she would read a book, other times she would watch videos with her headphones on. She tried not to make a sound to avoid disturbing her, but when she couldn't hold it in, she would whisper softly. [[18387 旁白 neutral]]
She talked about things happening in her life and recalled some memories from the past. [[18388 旁白 neutral]]
During this time, Chi Xiaocheng kept her consciousness hidden in this body. It's worth mentioning that even when Su Tao recalled the past, she was talking about the time after she became a Yandere. [[18389 旁白 neutral]]
Not like before, when she always talked about their childhood. [[18390 旁白 neutral]]
She had truly realized that the person she loved was the current cute, yet slightly unhinged, Xiaocheng. [[18391 旁白 neutral]]
Even though the data shown by the status glasses indicated that the affection from 'like' still hadn't reached 70. [[18392 旁白 neutral]]
Besides Su Tao, the second most frequent visitor was Fang Ning. [[18393 旁白 neutral]]
After running into Su Tao one evening, this little one deliberately avoided her visiting hours. [[18394 旁白 neutral]]
She now works at the Yangyang Cat Cafe and would come over for a while in the morning before work, and also for an hour during her lunch break. [[18395 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't say anything, just stand at the door and watch her quietly. [[18396 旁白 neutral]]
Then there were Dongfang Yang and Si Chen. Dongfang Yang came every day to check on the situation with Professor Su. [[18397 旁白 neutral]]
As for Si Chen, the young nurses at the hospital secretly called him a perverted exhibitionist. [[18398 旁白 neutral]]
Although it was starting to warm up a bit in February, winter wasn't over yet. [[18399 旁白 neutral]]
The cold air was chilly enough that even a down jacket might not be enough, but this young master always liked to sit in the hospital room shirtless. If not for his status, the nurses would have wanted to assign someone to watch him. [[18400 旁白 neutral]]
They were afraid he would do something perverted. [[18401 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, there were Chi Song and Brother Long. [[18402 旁白 neutral]]
The two quiet, older men didn't say much. They just stood motionless in the hospital room for two hours before leaving silently. [[18403 旁白 neutral]]
But their pained expressions couldn't be hidden from anyone. [[18404 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, Chu Lingfeng, as a miracle doctor, tried to find excuses to visit Chi Xiaocheng several times. The closer it got to the time of her awakening, the more anxious he seemed. [[18405 旁白 neutral]]
But as her body gradually recovered, Dongfang Yang trusted his medical team and Professor Su more, and Si Chen completely ignored the guy. [[18406 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao's sixth sense told her that Chu Lingfeng was not very trustworthy. His so-called "miracle needles" and medical skills were too mysterious. Xiaocheng was getting better now, what if he gave her a couple of pokes and she died? [[18407 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, she trusted Dongfang Yang and Si Chen more, who were like brothers and friends. [[18408 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng's revival countdown: three days. [[18409 旁白 neutral]]
