Chapter 121: She's Waiting for You to Come Home [[10679 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Ming watched blankly as Dongfang Yang tore the marriage contract to pieces and threw them into the air. [[10680 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't react for a moment. "Torn... it's torn?" [[10681 萧鸣 sad]]
Ignoring the pain in his stomach from the kick, he quickly picked up a piece from the ground. Less than half of the red, contract-like fingerprint remained. [[10682 旁白 neutral]]
He never expected that Dongfang Yang, a son of a prominent family, would flip the table like this. [[10683 旁白 neutral]]
He burst with anger, "Dongfang Yang! Do you have any idea what you're doing?!" [[10684 萧鸣 angry]]
"I just tore up a piece of paper you were using to borrow someone else's power, that's all." Dongfang Yang cracked his knuckles and said with a calm expression, "Or do you want to test your strength against me?" [[10685 东方阳 neutral]]
Although many upper-class people saw him as a good-for-nothing who just wasted his family's resources, as a son from a great family, his fighting skills were not bad. [[10686 旁白 neutral]]
He snorted with disdain. "If you fight me now for Su Tao and make an enemy of the Dongfang family, I might actually respect you more." [[10687 东方阳 angry]]
"Otherwise, just shut up!" [[10688 东方阳 angry]]
With a cold snort, Dongfang Yang glanced at the stunned Su Tao. "Without this marriage contract, can you see who is important to you now? I know that as an orphan, you long for a family, for this father you've never met. But you need to understand." [[10689 东方阳 angry]]
"Real family isn't about blood ties. It's about people who love you, accept you, support you no matter what, and are willing to give everything for you." [[10690 东方阳 neutral]]
"If your so-called father came back deep in debt, drinking heavily, and even hit Chi Xiaocheng who cares about you, would you still call him 'father' just because of blood?" [[10691 东方阳 angry]]
Dongfang Yang clicked his tongue in annoyance. "The person who treasures you is right here, yet you're looking for something so distant and unreal. If your father really cared about you, would he send a loser like this back to find you instead of coming back himself?" [[10692 东方阳 angry]]
Pointing at the angry but restrained Xiao Ming, Dongfang Yang spoke to Su Tao in a commanding tone, "Now, if you're worried about Chi Xiaocheng, call her on your phone!" [[10693 东方阳 angry]]
Su Tao quickly came to her senses and nodded firmly. [[10694 旁白 neutral]]
First, she tried a WeChat video call to Chi Xiaocheng, but after half a minute, there was no answer. [[10695 旁白 neutral]]
A bad feeling started to grow inside her, and she immediately tried calling her phone number. [[10696 旁白 neutral]]
The call went through, but no one picked up! [[10697 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lip. "No one is answering." [[10698 苏桃 sad]]
As soon as she finished speaking, a set of keys was tossed to her. Dongfang Yang looked towards Xiao Ming without turning his head, his tall figure in a red windbreaker standing firm. "The car is at the hotel entrance. Call me if anything happens." [[10699 东方阳 neutral]]
Feeling more and more uneasy and anxious, Su Tao knew it wasn't the time to be sentimental. [[10700 旁白 neutral]]
She clutched the keys and said, "Thank you!" [[10701 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang smiled slightly and waved his hand. "Drive safely. Chi Xiaocheng still owes me twenty thousand yuan, don't let her get out of it." [[10702 东方阳 happy]]
After watching Su Tao leave quickly, he turned to Xiao Ming. He wasn't flustered at all, even though Xiao Ming's two bodyguards were now protecting him. [[10703 旁白 neutral]]
"Now, it's time to talk about our business!" [[10704 东方阳 angry]]
Meanwhile, Su Tao, having rushed out of the hotel and now in another one of Dongfang Yang's sports cars, was constantly calling Chi Xiaocheng. [[10705 旁白 neutral]]
Her face grew more and more anxious. [[10706 旁白 neutral]]
Whenever she sent Xiaocheng a message, she would always reply instantly if her phone was nearby. [[10707 旁白 neutral]]
If something delayed her, she would add a message like, "Sorry Taotao, I didn't see the message and couldn't reply in time," so she wouldn't worry too much. [[10708 旁白 neutral]]
Not to mention phone calls and video chats; as long as Chi Xiaocheng was free, she would always answer! [[10709 旁白 neutral]]
But now, the police had surely taken Xiaocheng home safely. [[10710 旁白 neutral]]
So why wasn't she answering the phone at home? [[10711 旁白 neutral]]
Was she asleep? [[10712 旁白 neutral]]
Was her phone on silent? [[10713 旁白 neutral]]
Or had something happened? [[10714 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't dare to think too much and just pressed harder on the gas pedal. [[10715 旁白 neutral]]
She honked her horn countless times on the way and didn't even notice she was speeding. [[10716 旁白 neutral]]
She just wanted to get back quickly and pray that Chi Xiaocheng had just fallen into a deep sleep and that's why she wasn't answering. [[10717 旁白 neutral]]
Speeding all the way, she finally returned to her apartment complex. [[10718 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao anxiously asked the security guard, Uncle Zhang, "Uncle, have you seen Xiaocheng?" [[10719 苏桃 sad]]
Uncle Zhang rubbed his mostly bald head. "You mean the Cheng girl? She came back an hour ago and hasn't gone out since. But she looked really tired." [[10720 张大爷 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a sense of relief when she heard that. [[10721 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you, Uncle." [[10722 苏桃 happy]]
It's good that she didn't go out. It's good. [[10723 旁白 neutral]]
If she's just at home, nothing bad could have happened. [[10724 旁白 neutral]]
She probably really is just asleep, right? [[10725 旁白 neutral]]
Arriving at the elevator, Su Tao began to wait, her tense heart relaxing a little. Dongfang Yang's frustrated shouting echoed in her mind. [[10726 旁白 neutral]]
Who did she really care about? [[10727 旁白 neutral]]
And what was she running from? [[10728 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, she knew the answer. She cared about Xiaocheng, without a doubt. [[10729 旁白 neutral]]
But she was also running from Xiaocheng's obsessive and twisted love. [[10730 旁白 neutral]]
It was because agreeing would lead to irreversible consequences that Su Tao hesitated again and again. [[10731 旁白 neutral]]
She knew that if she really agreed to be Chi Xiaocheng's girlfriend... [[10732 旁白 neutral]]
...then truly curing her yandere tendencies would become an impossible dream. [[10733 旁白 neutral]]
For the past half month, Chi Xiaocheng's good behavior had given Su Tao a perfect opportunity for a cure, and she didn't want to give up on it. [[10734 旁白 neutral]]
And she was also afraid of falling deeper. [[10735 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, she was only pretending to like Xiaocheng. [[10736 旁白 neutral]]
But what if one day, she fell hopelessly in love with her for real? What would she do then? [[10737 旁白 neutral]]
What would her future look like? [[10738 旁白 neutral]]
And it seemed that Xiaocheng was starting to notice her pretense. [[10739 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stepped out of the elevator, her slightly relaxed mood turning sad again. [[10740 旁白 neutral]]
Standing in front of Chi Xiaocheng's door, that sadness gradually turned into determination. [[10741 旁白 neutral]]
She slapped her own face, trying to psych herself up. "Su Tao, Su Tao, even Dongfang Yang said you're not acting like yourself. What are you hesitating for? Didn't you already decide to face Xiaocheng's feelings? You have to comfort her and protect her to have a chance to cure her illness!" [[10742 苏桃 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng is so easy to please. As for being a couple, I can just play with the definition a bit to get by. It'll definitely be fine." [[10743 苏桃 neutral]]
She took a deep breath. Perhaps because her thoughts were clearer, a relieved smile appeared on her lips as she placed her finger on the fingerprint lock. [[10744 旁白 neutral]]
Think of the best-case scenario. [[10745 旁白 neutral]]
At least, despite how dangerous tonight was, both she and Xiaocheng were safe, right? [[10746 旁白 neutral]]
There were still a few minutes until midnight. She could still give Xiaocheng a simple birthday celebration. [[10747 旁白 neutral]]
Then she would resolve her worries, and they could play with Da Wang together and go to sleep. [[10748 旁白 neutral]]
Holding that warm and comfortable body, they would welcome another beautiful day. [[10749 旁白 neutral]]
Creaak~ [[10750 旁白 neutral]]
The door opened. [[10751 旁白 neutral]]
A warm light was on in the entryway. [[10752 旁白 neutral]]
"Looks like Xiaocheng isn't mad. She always leaves a light on for me and a thermos of hot water when I'm coming back." [[10753 苏桃 happy]]
Stepping inside, Su Tao turned to close the door and bent down to change her shoes. [[10754 旁白 neutral]]
But when she had changed into her slippers and looked up at the living room, she froze as if struck by lightning. [[10755 旁白 neutral]]
Her relaxed expression slowly turned blank and then panicked. [[10756 旁白 neutral]]
The living room was a mess, as if a thief had broken in. [[10757 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng wasn't in the living room. Where was she? [[10758 旁白 neutral]]
