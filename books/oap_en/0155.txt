Chapter 155: A Single Action Affects Everything [[13655 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, there were other methods, but none could escape the most important point. [[13656 旁白 neutral]]
That was to find a new emotional support for Su Tao. [[13657 旁白 neutral]]
Something new that would allow her to forget the pain of Chi Xiaocheng's death. [[13658 旁白 neutral]]
For an ordinary person, this emotional support could be family, women, money, or even fishing—anything they liked. [[13659 旁白 neutral]]
But for Su Tao, Professor Su believed they needed a specific solution for her specific problem. [[13660 旁白 neutral]]
After thinking for a long time, she looked at Dongfang Yang. "Young Dongfang, considering the relationship between Miss Su and Miss Chi, I think you are the best candidate to be her new emotional support." [[13661 苏教授 neutral]]
"Me?" [[13662 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Professor Su, completely confused. [[13663 旁白 neutral]]
Their bond was thicker than that of sisters, and you want me to become Su Tao's emotional support? [[13664 东方阳 neutral]]
Should I wear a dress and pretend to be her younger sister? [[13665 东方阳 neutral]]
Oh no, maybe her older sister? [[13666 东方阳 neutral]]
This isn't right. I have some feelings for Su Tao, but I don't want to be her sister! [[13667 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su saw Dongfang Yang's confused face and knew he had gotten the wrong idea. [[13668 旁白 neutral]]
She lightly tapped his head and said with some annoyance, "I want you to pursue Su Tao and become someone she loves." [[13669 苏教授 angry]]
"Well..." [[13670 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang hesitated. [[13671 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su said, "I know what you're thinking, but this is for Miss Su's own good. Miss Chi's death is a huge blow to her. In an extreme case, I really think she might refuse treatment." [[13672 苏教授 neutral]]
"She might even think about ending her life to be with Miss Chi." [[13673 苏教授 sad]]
"Don't you like Miss Su? Right now, she needs someone to lean on. You are sincere about your feelings for her, and this is also a way to save her." [[13674 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang closed his eyes and sighed. "Professor, I understand what you're suggesting, but I can't take advantage of her when she is vulnerable." [[13675 东方阳 sad]]
Professor Su became angry. "You boy..." [[13676 苏教授 angry]]
Just as she raised her hand, she heard Dongfang Yang ask, "Professor, do you know what 'white moonlight' means?" [[13677 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su suddenly stopped and, after a moment of silence, slowly nodded. [[13678 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang sighed. "I didn't know what 'white moonlight' really meant before. I had only seen the term in novels or comics. But the first time I met Su Tao, I knew." [[13679 东方阳 sad]]
"She is the 'white moonlight' girl you often read about in stories." [[13680 东方阳 neutral]]
"Of course, that's just for me." [[13681 东方阳 neutral]]
"So, who is Su Tao's white moonlight?" [[13682 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked toward the operating room. The answer was right there in his line of sight. [[13683 旁白 neutral]]
"Professor, I understand you. You want me to pursue Su Tao, to fill the void in her heart and become her new emotional support." [[13684 东方阳 neutral]]
"But have you considered that I've known Su Tao for half a year at most? What about Chi Xiaocheng? She and Su Tao grew up together." [[13685 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang leaned back in his chair, spread his hands, and sighed. "How can my short six months compare to Chi Xiaocheng's dozen years of companionship?" [[13686 东方阳 sad]]
"Besides," Dongfang Yang's tone changed, becoming confident and assertive. "I am Dongfang Yang. I am me. I will pursue my feelings on my own terms one day. You want me to be a substitute for Chi Xiaocheng?" [[13687 东方阳 angry]]
"How is that any different from denying Chi Xiaocheng's existence and erasing her from this world!" [[13688 东方阳 angry]]
With that, Dongfang Yang stood up. "In short, Su Tao just needs an emotional support, right?" [[13689 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su nodded blankly. "Time will fade everything." [[13690 苏教授 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's eyes suddenly turned cold. "Professor, the will to live doesn't have to come from love or money. It can also be... hatred!" [[13691 东方阳 angry]]
This matter wasn't over yet! [[13692 旁白 neutral]]
He strode towards the hospital exit with his long legs, pulling out his phone at the same time. "Hello, Si Chen? Did you find out who did it?" [[13693 东方阳 neutral]]
"Found him." [[13694 司辰 neutral]]
Two cold words came from the other end of the phone. [[13695 旁白 neutral]]
—Ye Liang. [[13696 旁白 neutral]]
... [[13697 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, in another hospital, Ye Liang listened to his subordinate's report, a savage grin spreading across his already grim face. [[13698 旁白 neutral]]
"Hahahaha! Good riddance! That little bitch is finally gone!" [[13699 叶良 happy]]
Ye Liang truly hated Chi Xiaocheng to death. [[13700 旁白 neutral]]
If it weren't for her, he would have won Su Tao's heart long ago. He would have had a beauty in his arms and gained the support of her powerful "God of War" father, an irresistible combination. [[13701 旁白 neutral]]
And even if he met a better woman someday, he could just use Su Tao and then kick her aside. [[13702 旁白 neutral]]
But who knew that after months of effort, his plans would be ruined by someone like Chi Xiaocheng, whom he completely looked down on! [[13703 旁白 neutral]]
She really deserved to die! [[13704 叶良 happy]]
Ye Liang looked at Lin Fangya beside him and gave her a thumbs-up. "You did a great job! I thought you just suggested Chen Qian's method to poison them, but I didn't expect you to have a backup plan!" [[13705 叶良 happy]]
Lin Fangya chuckled. "I just posted a one million reward on the dark web to try my luck. I didn't expect some fool to actually take the job, and I was even more surprised it succeeded." [[13706 林芳雅 happy]]
They were both very happy, but another person standing nearby was clearly displeased. [[13707 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Ming toyed with his usual playing cards and said unhappily, "We agreed to only kill Chi Xiaocheng. Why did I hear that the bullet almost hit Su Tao? Our partnership is based on not harming Su Tao!" [[13708 萧鸣 angry]]
"You useless piece of trash, how dare you say that? What use are you anyway?" Ye Liang shot back without any courtesy. [[13709 叶良 angry]]
Xiao Ming was instantly furious, slamming his hand on the table. "I am the Dragon King! Say that again if you dare!" [[13710 萧鸣 angry]]
Ye Liang spat coldly on the floor. "Useless. If you had contributed even a little to the plan, would I have needed to do this?" [[13711 叶良 angry]]
Xiao Ming's eyes turned icy. [[13712 旁白 neutral]]
But after thinking of something, he clenched his fists, turned, and left the hospital room. [[13713 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang didn't care at all. He looked at Lin Fangya and said, "How is Chen Qian doing? And Su Tao, we must get rid of her!" [[13714 叶良 angry]]
The death of one Chi Xiaocheng was not enough. [[13715 旁白 neutral]]
After all, Chi Xiaocheng was just small fry. The one who truly scared Ye Liang was Su Tao. [[13716 旁白 neutral]]
If he didn't get rid of her and cover his tracks before her father returned, there would be endless trouble later. [[13717 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya said, "Chen Qian said she can't find an opportunity. Su Tao is with Chi Xiaocheng every day and isn't even going back to her dorm anymore." [[13718 林芳雅 neutral]]
"Chen Qian is useless too!" Ye Liang said. "I told her to visit a 'sick' Su Tao and prepare a poisoned apple or something for her to eat. She can't even do something so simple and she dares to say she likes me? Is she even worthy?" [[13719 叶良 angry]]
Lin Fangya nodded lightly. "But Si Chen has been investigating us. It will be difficult to make a move against Su Tao now." [[13720 林芳雅 neutral]]
Ye Liang was silent. He really didn't have the men to spare. After the recent incident blew up, it was hard to get things done even with money. [[13721 旁白 neutral]]
After hesitating, his eyes hardened. "Cancel the development and entry into Litchi City. Bring all of our people from Litchi City back to me!" [[13722 叶良 angry]]
He had always wanted to open up the underground market in Litchi City. [[13723 旁白 neutral]]
However, he was constantly harassed by local gangs, making progress slow. There were even signs of a retreat at one point. [[13724 旁白 neutral]]
If that's the case, then bring them all back to Jiuzhou City. [[13725 旁白 neutral]]
"I'd like to see how Si Chen can protect Su Tao once my men are back!" [[13726 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang's gaze grew more vicious, and his decision was firm. [[13727 旁白 neutral]]
But he didn't know that while he was making his move, a phone call also reached Chi Song in Litchi City. [[13728 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song, who was still expanding territory for "Brother Long," stood in the snow, smoking a cigarette. He brushed the snow off his shoulder with one thick, strong arm. [[13729 旁白 neutral]]
He answered the phone, "Hello, who is this?" [[13730 池松 neutral]]
"Is this Chi Song? I'm Si Chen." A calm and cold voice came through the phone. "I'm the one who has been providing you with information about the Ye family on behalf of the Si family. Now I have other news, and I need you to bring your men back to Jiuzhou City." [[13731 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Song frowned. "What news?" [[13732 池松 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Chi Xiaocheng is dead." [[13733 司辰 sad]]
