Chapter 223: An Ever-Increasing Distance [[19292 旁白 neutral]]
When Si Chen said this code phrase, Chi Xiaocheng paused for a moment. [[19293 旁白 neutral]]
The two stared at each other, and then Chi Xiaocheng asked back with a bit of confusion, "Never... never love Tao?" [[19294 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen nodded seriously. "Yes, never love Tao." [[19295 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked completely confused. "What do you mean? Young Master Si Chen, you don't like peaches? It's true that you can't really get peaches this season." [[19296 池小橙 neutral]]
*Hiss—* [[19297 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen sucked in a sharp breath, but Chi Xiaocheng complained about it. "Also, Young Master Si Chen, you've been acting strangely from the start. Not just you, but Dongfang Yang and Doctor Su too. You all keep asking me questions. Didn't I just get sick and sleep for a while? What on earth happened?" [[19298 池小橙 neutral]]
She had forgotten about being shot. Her confused memories had filled in the gap with being sick. [[19299 旁白 neutral]]
Now, Si Chen was really unsure if Chi Xiaocheng was pretending. [[19300 旁白 neutral]]
He had studied some psychology, and because of Chi Xiaocheng's situation, he had recently consulted Doctor Lin a lot. It was no exaggeration to say he could pass as a psychologist at a regular hospital. [[19301 旁白 neutral]]
Because of this, he didn't dare to make a definite judgment about Chi Xiaocheng's condition. [[19302 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, no matter how she acted or pretended, Si Chen could always sense something was off. He could feel that "Chi Xiaocheng is lying." [[19303 旁白 neutral]]
But now, that feeling was completely gone. [[19304 旁白 neutral]]
He believed there was only one way left to confirm if Chi Xiaocheng was faking it. [[19305 旁白 neutral]]
The startup password! [[19306 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was a yandere. As long as he said he liked Su Tao, no matter how much Chi Xiaocheng pretended, she would reveal her true self! [[19307 旁白 neutral]]
But... this startup password was a bit deadly. [[19308 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen had used it a few times, and each time he felt one step closer to death. The last time he tested it in the hospital room, if Chi Xiaocheng hadn't been in a "dead" state, she probably would have jumped up and tried to kill him. [[19309 旁白 neutral]]
And the note left by that doll had caused him several sleepless nights, afraid that if he fell asleep, he would never wake up. [[19310 旁白 neutral]]
Now... [[19311 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen moved as if to take off his shirt, wanting to try saying it, but when he looked at Chi Xiaocheng... [[19312 旁白 neutral]]
She tilted her head, seemingly confused by his action of taking off his shirt. [[19313 旁白 neutral]]
But at the corner of her mouth, there was a faint, cute smile. [[19314 旁白 neutral]]
The more Si Chen looked at that faint smile, the more creeped out he felt. [[19315 旁白 neutral]]
His movement to take off his shirt paused for three seconds. [[19316 旁白 neutral]]
"Forget it, I'm fine." [[19317 司辰 neutral]]
He'd better forget about this startup password. He had a feeling that if he really said it, he probably wouldn't escape death. [[19318 旁白 neutral]]
However, he didn't give up on one last try. He decided to be direct. "Chi Xiaocheng, it's just you and me here. There are no cameras or listening devices in the room. We've been working together for so long, don't you trust me by now?" [[19319 司辰 neutral]]
"Just tell me directly, our plan against Su Tao is still on, right?" [[19320 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen looked seriously into Chi Xiaocheng's eyes, trying to see if her answer would be a lie or the truth. [[19321 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng's answer disappointed him. [[19322 旁白 neutral]]
Those eyes, a little red but now clear, showed confusion. [[19323 旁白 neutral]]
"Young Master Si Chen, what on earth are you talking about? I can understand your words, but I have no idea what they mean." [[19324 池小橙 neutral]]
"A plan against Su Tao? Although I don't really care about her, she's still the older sister I grew up with. Not liking her is one thing, but you can't harm her." [[19325 池小橙 neutral]]
It was a somewhat indifferent, but expected, answer. [[19326 旁白 neutral]]
Given Chi Xiaocheng's current feelings for Su Tao, even while disliking, fearing, and rejecting her, she still wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her. [[19327 旁白 neutral]]
They argued and had a falling out, but it wasn't to the point of wishing the other person dead. [[19328 旁白 neutral]]
But for Si Chen, this answer wasn't good news. [[19329 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't dare test the startup password now, but if Chi Xiaocheng's memory was really confused... [[19330 旁白 neutral]]
...wouldn't his plan be ruined? [[19331 旁白 neutral]]
No one could predict when Su Tao's "God of War" father would return. Maybe tomorrow? Maybe after the New Year? [[19332 旁白 neutral]]
But she was Chi Xiaocheng, after all. A yandere! [[19333 旁白 neutral]]
She was bold enough to fake her own death, so faking amnesia now seemed normal. [[19334 旁白 neutral]]
Sooner or later, she would get her memory back, right? [[19335 旁白 neutral]]
Before that happens, he just needed to make Su Tao fall in love with Chi Xiaocheng. Whether she was pretending or not, that part would definitely not change! [[19336 旁白 neutral]]
After giving Chi Xiaocheng a couple of quick replies, Si Chen left with a serious expression, lost in thought. [[19337 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, oh Su Tao, if you ignore Chi Xiaocheng, it's going to be very difficult for me. [[19338 旁白 neutral]]
He left the hospital room and was immediately met with questions from Su Tao and Dongfang Yang. [[19339 旁白 neutral]]
His answer was the same as theirs: Chi Xiaocheng's memory was confused. To what extent was unknown, and how to treat it was also unknown. [[19340 旁白 neutral]]
But he offered another judgment: it would be best to wait until tomorrow for Doctor Chen and Doctor Lin to check on her. [[19341 旁白 neutral]]
The three of them questioning her one after another was not normal, and Chi Xiaocheng had already noticed. [[19342 旁白 neutral]]
Her memory was just confused; she wasn't stupid. [[19343 旁白 neutral]]
With Professor Su, Doctor Lin, and Doctor Chen asking questions one by one, even a fool would realize something was wrong. [[19344 旁白 neutral]]
They would give her a heads-up tonight, and then tomorrow, the two doctors would question her under the excuse of treatment. [[19345 旁白 neutral]]
After discussing, the three of them, along with Professor Su, confirmed this plan. [[19346 旁白 neutral]]
The only thing that disappointed Su Tao was that Doctor Cheng still hadn't replied to her message. [[19347 旁白 sad]]
She really wanted to invite Doctor Cheng to come to Jiuzhou City. [[19348 旁白 neutral]]
... [[19349 旁白 neutral]]
That night, Su Tao left the hospital and walked home. [[19350 旁白 neutral]]
The sky was dark and gloomy, with no starlight or moonlight. [[19351 旁白 sad]]
The weather forecast today said it would be sunny then cloudy, with rain in the afternoon. Su Tao had been at the hospital all day and hadn't seen a single drop of rain. In fact, it had been bright all day, without even a cloud in sight. [[19352 旁白 neutral]]
"The weather forecast is as inaccurate as ever." [[19353 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao breathed on her cold, reddish hands, then gave a sad smile. "In a way, it's actually quite accurate." [[19354 苏桃 sad]]
The clouds didn't block the sun in the sky. [[19355 旁白 sad]]
But they blocked her sun. [[19356 旁白 sad]]
In her world, tears were falling like rain. [[19357 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng had woken up, but her memory was a problem, and her attitude toward her was completely different from before. [[19358 旁白 sad]]
What would the road ahead be like? [[19359 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao looked up, reaching toward the sky as if to grab the high-up moon. [[19360 旁白 sad]]
But after searching for a long time, she couldn't find the moon in the clouds. [[19361 旁白 sad]]
There wasn't even a single twinkling star. [[19362 旁白 sad]]
In the second half of the night, when she couldn't sleep, a heavy rain began to pour. [[19363 旁白 sad]]
With the sound of thunder, even the scarecrow doll she saw as a keepsake couldn't give her the slightest sense of security. [[19364 旁白 sad]]
Dawang was afraid of thunder and was probably hiding in some corner of the house. [[19365 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng was awake. Their relationship should be getting closer and tighter. [[19366 旁白 sad]]
But now, Su Tao only felt a boundless loneliness coming from all around her. [[19367 旁白 sad]]
Being unable to sleep meant she couldn't even dream. [[19368 旁白 sad]]
The girl she cared so much about seemed to be drifting further and further away from her. [[19369 旁白 sad]]
