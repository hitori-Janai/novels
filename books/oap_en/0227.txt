Chapter 227: Her Realization [[19568 旁白 neutral]]
Memories flashed and shifted in her chaotic mind, finally settling on a certain night. [[19569 旁白 neutral]]
It was one of the three lucid dreams Su Tao once had. [[19570 旁白 neutral]]
One of those dreams was almost exactly what Dr. Lin had described, wasn't it? [[19571 旁白 neutral]]
In the dream, she had been deceived by Ye Liang and had taken his side, never finding a chance to explain things to Xiaocheng. As time went on, the misunderstanding deepened. [[19572 旁白 neutral]]
And in that dream, Xiaocheng's fate was to be hunted down, tortured, and finally drowned in the sea by Ye Liang. [[19573 旁白 neutral]]
What was different from the dream was that in Chi Xiaocheng's memory, both Dongfang Yang and Si Chen were on her side. [[19574 旁白 neutral]]
The influence of real memories was intertwining. [[19575 旁白 neutral]]
But the part about her, Su Tao, had been changed. [[19576 旁白 neutral]]
Selective amnesia... [[19577 苏桃 sad]]
Choosing to forget the things that cause you pain? [[19578 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao gave a bitter smile, her expression becoming incredibly downcast. [[19579 旁白 neutral]]
"In Xiaocheng's subconscious, am I the source of her pain?" [[19580 苏桃 sad]]
"She's a yandere. Could her love for me also turn into such hate?" [[19581 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's mind was a mess, and she was starting to lose track of the complicated relationships. [[19582 旁白 neutral]]
After a long while, a faint sound escaped her dry lips, "Dr. Lin, what's the treatment for Xiaocheng? How can she be treated?" [[19583 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Lin stroked his chin, "There are several common methods." [[19584 林医生 neutral]]
"We can try to awaken her memories through sensory stimulation, emotional resonance, and subconscious recall techniques, along with some professional equipment. We'll start with the gentlest methods first." [[19585 林医生 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang couldn't bear to see her like this and said, "Don't worry, I'll handle all of this. Don't lose hope. This is definitely just temporary. Her will to see you was so strong she came back from the dead. This is just a bit of memory confusion." [[19586 东方阳 neutral]]
Si Chen nodded firmly, not disagreeing this time. "Besides, Ye Liang is already dead. Once Chi Xiaocheng's emotions stabilize a bit and we tell her this news, many of her puzzles will be solved." [[19587 司辰 neutral]]
"Then you need to apologize to her sincerely. If once isn't enough, apologize ten times." [[19588 司辰 neutral]]
"Even if you don't want to apologize and think you've done nothing wrong, you at least have to go along with her current memories." [[19589 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen pushed up his glasses, "Once your relationship eases up, you can interact like normal sisters again. The more you're around each other, the more chances there will be for her memories to be triggered." [[19590 司辰 neutral]]
Everyone agreed with his point. [[19591 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had never been one to be easily defeated by hardship. [[19592 旁白 neutral]]
She had survived deeper despair, so what was this? [[19593 旁白 neutral]]
After taking a deep breath, she slapped her pale cheeks hard with both hands. [[19594 旁白 neutral]]
A sharp sound was followed by a stinging pain. [[19595 旁白 neutral]]
The pain helped her suppress her complicated emotions, and she said very seriously, "You're right. Xiaocheng has a chance to recover her memories, and her dislike for me is only temporary. Even with these confused memories, I have a chance to start over!" [[19596 苏桃 happy]]
She couldn't give up like she had before. [[19597 旁白 neutral]]
There were things she could do herself! [[19598 旁白 neutral]]
She had promised Xiaocheng in her dream that she wouldn't give up on herself. She had to look forward and walk towards the future. [[19599 旁白 neutral]]
"Last time it was death, this time it's memory loss." [[19600 苏桃 neutral]]
"Perhaps this was a test for her past avoidance. Sooner or later, her Xiaocheng will affectionately call her Taozi again!" [[19601 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao walked out of the office door, took a deep breath of the disinfectant-filled hospital air, and lowered her head to think. [[19602 旁白 neutral]]
"In Xiaocheng's current memories, she hates me. Before her emotions stabilize, and before Si Chen tells her that Ye Liang is dead, I should avoid contact with her as much as possible." [[19603 苏桃 neutral]]
"Then, there needs to be a chance for her to know I've repented, to understand that I still care about her. After I apologize, our relationship can start to mend." [[19604 苏桃 neutral]]
"But at first, Xiaocheng will definitely still hold a grudge against me. So, I'll take care of her meticulously in daily life and prove myself with my actions!" [[19605 苏桃 neutral]]
The more Su Tao thought, the clearer the look in her eyes became. [[19606 旁白 neutral]]
She immediately found Dongfang Yang. "Dongfang Yang, I need you to get me a room in the hospital. I plan to live here!" [[19607 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang asked with confusion, "Why would you live here?" [[19608 东方阳 neutral]]
"To take care of Xiaocheng!" Su Tao said firmly. "Even though she hates me now and I can't see her, I'll go apologize as soon as Si Chen tells her that Ye Liang is dead!" [[19609 苏桃 neutral]]
As soon as she said this, Dongfang Yang understood what she meant. [[19610 旁白 neutral]]
Running away from problems solved nothing. [[19611 旁白 neutral]]
The old her would have probably shut herself away, right? [[19612 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was pleased and gave Su Tao a thumbs-up, signaling he would take care of it. [[19613 旁白 neutral]]
Her room was arranged in 303, and it was fully equipped. [[19614 旁白 neutral]]
This was Dongfang Yang's private hospital, so even the family rest areas were furnished with high-end items. [[19615 旁白 neutral]]
And now, Su Tao had to face another long wait. [[19616 旁白 neutral]]
"Still, should I go home once in a while? I can't just not feed Dawang. If Xiaocheng's memory comes back and she sees Dawang has gotten a bit fatter, will she praise me for taking good care of him?" [[19617 苏桃 neutral]]
"No, that's not right. Xiaocheng always used to say things like, 'Dawang, you stupid cat, you're getting fat from eating so much.' Maybe she won't be able to pick him up if he gets too fat." [[19618 苏桃 sad]]
"I should probably let him go hungry for a bit." [[19619 苏桃 neutral]]
On the second night after Chi Xiaocheng woke up, there were seven days until New Year's Eve. [[19620 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stood on the third-floor balcony of the hospital, staring blankly at the fireworks that occasionally bloomed in the sky. [[19621 旁白 neutral]]
The rain had stopped today. As the new year drew closer, people everywhere started setting off fireworks and firecrackers. [[19622 旁白 neutral]]
The festive atmosphere was gradually building, with countless people preparing to celebrate. [[19623 旁白 neutral]]
But to her, it just felt noisy. [[19624 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone to check. It had been two days, and Dr. Cheng still hadn't replied. [[19625 旁白 neutral]]
But to her surprise and delight, Cheng Cheng had actually sent her a question mark. [[19626 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, she could pour out the words she had been holding in her heart. [[19627 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao leaned against the balcony railing as the evening breeze lifted her ponytail, as if calling for her to turn around and look at the beautiful fireworks in the sky. [[19628 旁白 neutral]]
The young woman faced the long hospital corridor, silently refusing. [[19629 旁白 neutral]]
She tapped on Cheng Cheng's profile picture, typing with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow, "Good news, Xiaocheng is awake. Bad news, her memory is messed up, her impression of me has plummeted, and she's even saying she hates me." [[19630 苏桃 sad]]
Cheng Cheng: "What, are you getting sentimental again?" [[19631 程程 neutral]]
Taozi: "What do you mean sentimental? I'm seriously trying to talk about my troubles!" [[19632 苏桃 angry]]
Cheng Cheng: "I can tell how anxious you are just from your text. I can't imagine how loud you'd be if we were on a call." [[19633 程程 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng: "But back to the topic, what's the situation with Xiaocheng? Did something else happen after she woke up?" [[19634 程程 neutral]]
Taozi: "Well, her body is fine, but the neurons in her brain are severely damaged. Her emotions are dulled, and she's become a bit cold. Also, her memory is messed up." [[19635 苏桃 sad]]
"Memory messed up?" Cheng Cheng's message was full of confusion. "How is it messed up? Is it serious?" [[19636 程程 neutral]]
Taozi: "For me, it's very serious!" [[19637 苏桃 sad]]
Looking at the few words she had replied, Su Tao sighed again. [[19638 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes, she even wondered if it would have been better if Xiaocheng had lost her memory completely. [[19639 苏桃 sad]]
