Chapter 157: Pain that comes late. [[13806 旁白 neutral]]
It felt like I had a very, very long dream. You ask what I dreamed about? [[13807 苏桃 neutral]]
I don't remember some of it. [[13808 苏桃 neutral]]
"But, that was a really comfortable sleep!" [[13809 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao crossed her hands and stretched for a long time. The tiredness in her body was greatly reduced, making her feel unusually relaxed. [[13810 旁白 neutral]]
The morning sun streamed in through the window, casting a bright circle on the frosted glass. The glaring light shone into the room, making Su Tao squint her eyes without thinking. [[13811 旁白 neutral]]
The young nurse, who had been instructed by Professor Su, was watching the monitor for Su Tao's room. [[13812 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing she was awake, she immediately came to the hospital room and asked cautiously, "Miss Su, you're awake. How are you... feeling?" [[13813 小护士 neutral]]
Su Tao first looked at the young nurse with a puzzled expression, then gave a relaxed smile. "I just collapsed because I was too busy. I feel much better after sleeping." [[13814 苏桃 happy]]
"Really?" The young nurse was still a little worried. "But you still look a bit pale." [[13815 小护士 neutral]]
"I do?" Su Tao turned to the side and saw her face in a mirror on the desk next to her. [[13816 苏桃 neutral]]
Her eyes looked tired from the long sleep, her lips were a little pale, and since she wore no makeup, she couldn't hide the worn-out look on her face. [[13817 旁白 neutral]]
Her dark hair had clearly been cared for, but it was messy from how she slept. A few strands of bangs fell over her right eye, looking a little unsettling. [[13818 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao touched the skin on her face and gave a small laugh. "It's nothing. I think I had a nightmare, so I didn't rest very well. That's why I look a little pale." [[13819 苏桃 neutral]]
She glanced sideways at the young nurse. "By the way, can I leave the hospital now? Xiaocheng is at home waiting for me to cook." [[13820 苏桃 neutral]]
The young nurse's mouth fell slightly open when she heard this. [[13821 旁白 neutral]]
A look of shock and disbelief flashed across her face. [[13822 旁白 neutral]]
"I... I'll go get Professor Su!" [[13823 小护士 neutral]]
She left with those words and quickly ran out of the room. [[13824 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving a confused Su Tao behind. "There's no need to be in such a hurry. But I do feel a little tired, I must have slept for too long." [[13825 苏桃 neutral]]
She shook her head. After seeing two small flower pots and a watering can by the window, a small smile appeared on her face. [[13826 旁白 happy]]
She walked over, picked up the watering can, and slowly watered the two small flowers. [[13827 旁白 neutral]]
The trickling sound entered her ears. Drops of water joined into a stream and hit the petals, making the flowers sway gently with the impact of the water. [[13828 旁白 neutral]]
This scene was very healing for Su Tao to watch. "I think Xiaocheng used to like growing potted plants at home. Maybe I'll buy a couple on the way back?" [[13829 苏桃 happy]]
She tapped her chin, thinking, "I think Xiaocheng likes white lilies of the valley. Besides Da Wang, the house could use a bit more life..." [[13830 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao brushed her hair back, seeming to look forward to Chi Xiaocheng's hug when she got home. [[13831 旁白 happy]]
The corners of her mouth couldn't help but lift. The morning sun streamed through the window onto her, and in her hospital gown, she looked so beautiful at that moment. [[13832 旁白 happy]]
Her worn-out expression was just like a modern, sick beauty. [[13833 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su hurried to the doorway, then slowed down before entering. Seeing Su Tao watering the flowers, she first checked her expression, then breathed a sigh of relief. "It's so good to see you back to normal. You haven't had breakfast yet, have you, Miss Su? I'll have someone bring a portion over in a bit." [[13834 苏教授 neutral]]
"Oh, no need." Su Tao smiled at Professor Su. "I'm planning to go home soon. Xiaocheng can't cook, so I have to go home and make her breakfast." [[13835 苏桃 happy]]
"Go home?" [[13836 苏教授 neutral]]
Professor Su was stunned for a moment. [[13837 旁白 neutral]]
The young woman watering the flowers nodded gently. "Yes. Xiaocheng can't cook, so I can't help it. I've always cooked for her. That girl is probably still sleeping right now. I'll probably have to wake her up when I get back." [[13838 苏桃 neutral]]
"But Professor Su, even though taking care of Xiaocheng like this is a bit busy, I really like seeing her cute expression when she eats. It always feels very healing." [[13839 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao looked to the side and scratched her cheek, a little embarrassed. [[13840 苏桃 neutral]]
Seeing Professor Su's expression, she paused. "Professor Su, what's wrong? You look so grim." [[13841 苏桃 neutral]]
Professor Su was silent for a moment. "Miss Su, do you remember why you were hospitalized?" [[13842 苏教授 neutral]]
"Why?" [[13843 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao tried to remember, but she clutched her head in pain and took several sharp breaths. [[13844 旁白 sad]]
She shook her head again. "I... I think I was hospitalized because I fainted from being too tired, right?" [[13845 苏桃 neutral]]
"I don't really remember." [[13846 苏桃 neutral]]
Professor Su fell silent at her words and immediately understood Su Tao's situation. [[13847 旁白 neutral]]
When people suffer a major shock, their brain might initiate a self-protection mechanism and they faint. [[13848 旁白 neutral]]
In that moment, the mind goes blank and gives up on thinking, what's commonly known as a system crash. [[13849 旁白 neutral]]
A person's emotions might disappear in an instant. They might not accept what happened and gradually become indifferent. [[13850 旁白 neutral]]
Or, like now, they experience protective amnesia. [[13851 旁白 neutral]]
She hasn't forgotten that person, she just doesn't want to recall that past event. Her brain protected her to prevent a mental breakdown. [[13852 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su stood at the door of the hospital room, her face showing a struggle and hesitation. [[13853 旁白 neutral]]
She was thinking about whether to tell her about Chi Xiaocheng. [[13854 旁白 neutral]]
If her instincts are rejecting the memory, bringing it up herself could cause her emotions to explode, possibly driving her mad. [[13855 旁白 neutral]]
However, while she was hesitating, Su Tao was already looking around. "Huh? Where's my phone? Professor Su, did you move my phone while I was sleeping?" [[13856 苏桃 neutral]]
Your phone... was left at your house and never brought here. [[13857 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su sighed. "What are you looking for your phone for?" [[13858 苏教授 neutral]]
"To call Xiaocheng, of course." Su Tao smiled, and even with her pale face, she was as radiant as a blooming flower. [[13859 苏桃 happy]]
Those pure eyes made Professor Su's heart ache. [[13860 旁白 sad]]
Even if she doesn't tell her the truth now, what about when she really goes home? [[13861 旁白 sad]]
She would find Chi Xiaocheng not at home, and then go searching like a madwoman. [[13862 旁白 sad]]
This kind of thing can't be hidden forever. [[13863 旁白 sad]]
Professor Su sighed for what felt like the tenth time. "Su Tao, please calm yourself. I have something to tell you." [[13864 苏教授 sad]]
Su Tao nodded. "Go ahead, Professor Su." [[13865 苏桃 neutral]]
"Your Xiaocheng... is already dead." [[13866 苏教授 sad]]
Hearing this, Su Tao tilted her head, her smile a bit stiff. "Professor Su, what kind of joke are you telling? Isn't Xiaocheng at home? How could she be dead..." [[13867 苏桃 sad]]
"...you know." [[13868 苏桃 sad]]
She slowly spoke the last words as the color began to drain from her pupils. [[13869 旁白 sad]]
The watering can in her hand remained half-tilted, and water gradually overflowed from the pot. [[13870 旁白 sad]]
However, Su Tao seemed frozen, her trembling lips turned to look at Professor Su. "Professor, you just said... what happened to Xiaocheng?" [[13871 苏桃 sad]]
"She's dead." [[13872 苏教授 sad]]
Professor Su turned her head away, a look of pity in her eyes, not daring to meet Su Tao's gaze. [[13873 旁白 sad]]
Hiding it from her would only cause her more pain. [[13874 旁白 sad]]
Sudden memories began to flood into Su Tao's mind like a tide. [[13875 旁白 sad]]
Because she couldn't accept it, her mind and body had instinctively protected themselves. [[13876 旁白 sad]]
However, some things can never be forgotten. [[13877 旁白 sad]]
Her pupils kept shrinking, and her lips and body began to tremble. [[13878 旁白 sad]]
Scene after scene flashed through her mind, finally stopping on the peaceful face of Chi Xiaocheng before she died. [[13879 旁白 sad]]
"Thud—!" [[13880 旁白 neutral]]
The watering can she was holding fell to the floor. [[13881 旁白 sad]]
