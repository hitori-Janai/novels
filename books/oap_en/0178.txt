Chapter 178: Sorry, I Forgot You Don't Like Oranges [[15495 旁白 neutral]]
The petite girl, unlike Su Tao, had pupils that had completely lost their light. She seemed devoid of spirit and emotion, looking at Su Tao in disbelief. [[15496 旁白 neutral]]
Every step she took seemed to land heavily on Su Tao's heart. [[15497 旁白 neutral]]
She looked down at Su Tao, who was sitting on the ground, and asked condescendingly, "Sister Su Tao, didn't you say last time that Sister Xiaocheng just went to a faraway place and would be back in two or three months at most?" [[15498 方柠 neutral]]
"What do you mean she died for you?" [[15499 方柠 neutral]]
"Were you lying to me last time?" [[15500 方柠 neutral]]
"You promised you would tell me when she came back." [[15501 方柠 neutral]]
Her tone was so matter-of-fact that it was impossible to tell if Fang Ning was blaming Su Tao. [[15502 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao supported herself with her hands on the floor, biting her lip, not daring to look at Fang Ning. She just lowered her head, hiding her expression with her hair. [[15503 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning reached out, grabbed Su Tao's shoulder, and forced her to make eye contact. "Hey, Sister Su Tao, tell me, is Sister Xiaocheng really dead?" [[15504 方柠 sad]]
What kind of eyes were those? [[15505 旁白 neutral]]
Empty, lifeless, filled with the despair of someone facing death, as if the sky was about to fall. [[15506 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's excuses got stuck in her throat. In the end, she could only stiffly say three words. [[15507 旁白 sad]]
"I'm sorry." [[15508 苏桃 sad]]
"So you really did lie to me?" Fang Ning gently let go of Su Tao. [[15509 方柠 sad]]
Su Tao squeezed her eyes shut, preparing to be hit by the little lolita, or even to be used as an object for her to vent her anger on. [[15510 旁白 neutral]]
But to her surprise, Fang Ning didn't fly into a rage or complain. She just asked calmly, "Then where is Sister Xiaocheng now?" [[15511 方柠 neutral]]
"She... is already dead." [[15512 苏桃 sad]]
"I'm asking about her body, or her ashes, or her grave, anything." Fang Ning said with a blank expression, "I want to see it for myself." [[15513 方柠 neutral]]
Inside, she was just like Su Tao at the beginning, unwilling to admit or face such a thing. [[15514 旁白 neutral]]
She held on to a tiny sliver of hope, thinking that maybe this was all a lie. [[15515 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao had already experienced the pain of gaining hope only to fall into despair. [[15516 旁白 sad]]
Twice. [[15517 旁白 sad]]
She gritted her teeth and said loudly, "Xiaocheng is dead! She died protecting me, I'm not lying to you about that!" [[15518 苏桃 sad]]
"You... you don't need to go confirm her body." [[15519 苏桃 sad]]
Fang Ning tilted her head. "What does it have to do with you if I go see my Sister Xiaocheng? I call you Sister Su Tao because Sister Xiaocheng wanted me to. Since you couldn't protect her, please don't tell me what to do, okay?" [[15520 方柠 angry]]
"Her body, where is it?" [[15521 方柠 angry]]
"Dongfang Yang's... private hospital, at the Great Sun Hospital." [[15522 苏桃 sad]]
After hearing this, Fang Ning left without looking back. [[15523 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao watched her leave, her right hand clenched into a fist and slammed heavily on the ground. [[15524 旁白 angry]]
Her teeth bit her lip until it bled. [[15525 旁白 sad]]
No tears fell, but her words were heart-wrenching: "Why... why don't you scold me either!" [[15526 苏桃 sad]]
Flashes of light began to appear around them. The once-beloved campus belle, the 'white moonlight' for countless people, was now in such a sorry state. [[15527 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, just as Su Tao was about to get up, a hand reached out to her. [[15528 旁白 neutral]]
"Why are you sitting here? What happened?" [[15529 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up and saw Chen Qian, who was holding lunch and fruit. She had just come back from the cafeteria. [[15530 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the outstretched hand and at Chen Qian, who blocked the sun and seemed to be looking down on her. She didn't take the hand. [[15531 旁白 neutral]]
She pushed herself up from the ground and explained in a listless tone, "It's nothing, I just... fell." [[15532 苏桃 sad]]
"I see. Have you had lunch?" Chen Qian didn't know that Chi Xiaocheng was dead yet. She just naturally reached into her bag and took out an orange. [[15533 陈倩 neutral]]
"Want some fruit? This stuff is really expensive at the cafeteria." [[15534 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao stared blankly at the orange Chen Qian offered and didn't take it. [[15535 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she slowly asked, "Chen Qian, let me ask you a question. Do you think... I deserve Xiaocheng?" [[15536 苏桃 sad]]
Chen Qian gave Su Tao a puzzled look. "Why are you asking this kind of question now?" [[15537 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao was confused. "Can't I ask this kind of question?" [[15538 苏桃 neutral]]
It wasn't that she couldn't ask. [[15539 旁白 neutral]]
It was just that Chen Qian didn't know what was going on with Su Tao again. [[15540 旁白 neutral]]
But since she was on "Team Orange" and enjoyed a bit of drama, she answered along, "From a friend's perspective, and considering your feelings, I'd say you deserve her." [[15541 陈倩 neutral]]
"After all, you're pretty, you're the campus belle, and your personality, while a bit slow at times, is quite good among girls these days. A girl like you would be a good match for anyone, you don't need to sell yourself short." [[15542 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her bleeding lip. "Then... what if you're not speaking as a friend and not considering my feelings?" [[15543 苏桃 sad]]
Chen Qian shrugged. "Then it's obvious. Ever since Chi Xiaocheng and Ye Liang argued in college and you ignored her for months, I've felt that you don't deserve her." [[15544 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes looked dazed. "So... that's what you really thought?" [[15545 苏桃 sad]]
"I'm just being honest. You said she was a yandere and you couldn't accept it. If I remember correctly, I tried to persuade you many times, right?" [[15546 陈倩 neutral]]
Chen Qian glanced at Su Tao. "If you don't like her, reject her. If you like her, accept her and her yandere side. You might be conflicted, but to outsiders, you just look like a player who's stringing Chi Xiaocheng along." [[15547 陈倩 angry]]
"You want it all, but you don't want to give anything in return." [[15548 陈倩 angry]]
After she finished, she tossed the orange in her hand. "Anyway, let's not talk about this. It'll hurt our friendship. Do you still want the orange?" [[15549 陈倩 neutral]]
"I..." [[15550 苏桃 neutral]]
Just as Su Tao was about to reach for it, she heard Chen Qian speak again. [[15551 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, I forgot you've never really liked oranges." [[15552 陈倩 neutral]]
She took the orange back. [[15553 旁白 neutral]]
And with that, Chen Qian turned and walked away. [[15554 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian didn't care what Su Tao was thinking. She only cared if what she had just said was okay. [[15555 旁白 neutral]]
It should be fine, right? [[15556 旁白 neutral]]
It didn't matter what Su Tao had done or what her real thoughts were. Chi Xiaocheng should be satisfied with what she said. [[15557 旁白 neutral]]
She wondered if she would get another high-tech pill that could improve her looks and figure before the end of the semester. [[15558 旁白 neutral]]
One by one, her friends left her. Su Tao's hand, still reaching for the orange, didn't pull back. [[15559 旁白 sad]]
Her expression just grew more pained, and her movements became more listless as she walked. [[15560 旁白 sad]]
"Do I really... not deserve Xiaocheng?" [[15561 苏桃 sad]]
She didn't go home. Instead, she went back to the cat cafe and sat there for the entire day, skipping lunch and dinner. [[15562 旁白 sad]]
She wanted to sort out her thoughts, but her mind was a mess. [[15563 旁白 sad]]
Her mind was filled with images of Chi Xiaocheng. [[15564 旁白 sad]]
The good memories seemed to be frozen in their childhood. [[15565 旁白 sad]]
Ever since the basement... [[15566 旁白 sad]]
No, even earlier. [[15567 旁白 sad]]
Ever since their fight during the summer vacation, when she sided with Ye Liang and ignored Chi Xiaocheng for three months. [[15568 旁白 sad]]
Since then, the girl with the tea-colored eyes had only brought her pressure and fear. [[15569 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao didn't know how she got home. By the time she reached Chi Xiaocheng's apartment complex, it was already 11 p.m. [[15570 旁白 neutral]]
The snow was falling heavily, coating her hair in a layer of white. [[15571 旁白 neutral]]
Before Su Tao could enter the complex gates, she saw another small figure standing at the entrance. [[15572 旁白 neutral]]
It was Fang Ning. After leaving without a word at noon, she had been waiting here for a while. [[15573 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly walked over, wanting to show concern and also to explain. [[15574 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out to brush the snow off Fang Ning's shoulders, but the little lolita slapped her hand away. [[15575 方柠 angry]]
Her eyes, no longer empty, were now filled with an indescribable disgust. [[15576 旁白 angry]]
"Miss Su Tao, please don't come here. This isn't your home, and you don't deserve to live in Sister Xiaocheng's home!" [[15577 方柠 angry]]
