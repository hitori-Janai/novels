Chapter 202: Her Flower [[17695 旁白 neutral]]
In front of the stage, Su Tao hesitated for a long time, but still reached out and grabbed the wrist. [[17697 苏桃 neutral]]
But after looking at the dance floor, at the couples of men and women, and even men with men and women with women, all enjoying themselves, she let go again. [[17698 旁白 neutral]]
The person in front of her tilted their head. "What's wrong?" [[17699 唐糖 neutral]]
"Let's just forget it." [[17700 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao shook her head, "Tang Tang, this kind of thing is too easily misunderstood." [[17701 苏桃 sad]]
The teenager who was called ran a hand through her short hair. "Let them misunderstand. Besides, if I hadn't come over just now, you would have been surrounded by twenty or thirty young masters." [[17702 唐糖 neutral]]
"Did you know? The more you refuse, the more excited they get. They see you as a difficult prize to win. Whoever captures your attention can brag about it for a long time." [[17703 唐糖 neutral]]
Tang Tang explained seriously to Su Tao, "Don't think that just saying no is enough. If they find out you don't have a powerful background, they'll stick to you like glue and you won't be able to get rid of them." [[17704 唐糖 neutral]]
Tang Tang herself hadn't expected to see her old middle school classmate at this banquet for her family. She remembered Su Tao as an orphan, and at first, she thought she had mistaken her for someone else. [[17705 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, although they hadn't seen each other in years and her appearance had changed, her aura and feeling were still the same. [[17706 旁白 neutral]]
When she saw Su Tao surrounded by many young men, she decisively stepped in to help her. [[17707 旁白 neutral]]
But even after she came over, the stares and whispers from the large crowd continued. [[17708 旁白 neutral]]
Tang Tang said helplessly to Su Tao, "I'm telling you, Su Tao, we're both girls, and we're both straight. What's there to misunderstand? Besides, with my current look, who wouldn't call me a young man?" [[17709 唐糖 neutral]]
"Besides, 'young man' is a neutral term, it can be used for both boys and girls." [[17710 唐糖 neutral]]
"But I can't deny that I'm shorter than you, that's for sure." [[17711 唐糖 neutral]]
Of course, Su Tao understood her old friend's intentions. [[17712 旁白 neutral]]
Accepting an invitation to the dance floor... [[17713 旁白 neutral]]
...meant that you were already taken. [[17714 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone here had status, so naturally, very few would try to steal someone else's flower. [[17715 旁白 neutral]]
But it was precisely because of this. [[17716 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hesitated again and again, but finally sighed and refused, "Let's just forget it. They're annoying, but it's just for a little while. My... a brother I'm close with will be here soon, and then it will be fine." [[17717 苏桃 sad]]
She already had her own flower. [[17718 旁白 neutral]]
Even though that flower had now withered and was struggling to be reborn. [[17719 旁白 neutral]]
She still didn't want to betray it in this way. [[17720 旁白 sad]]
Even if it was just a misunderstanding. [[17721 旁白 sad]]
Otherwise, Xiaocheng would be unhappy, right? [[17722 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao took out her phone and looked at the message from Si Chen. "I've found the doll. I'll bring it to you in a bit. Just enjoy the birthday banquet by yourself for now. Don't look so lost and anxious, it's not a good look." [[17723 旁白 neutral]]
Tang Tang watched the change in Su Tao's expression and shrugged helplessly. "Forget it. It seems you've been through a lot these past few years. But, if you don't know how to refuse those who approach you, it's much better to go outside for some fresh air." [[17724 唐糖 neutral]]
"Wandering onto the dance floor like you're window shopping just sends a signal that you're single." [[17725 唐糖 neutral]]
Su Tao composed herself and forced a smile. "Yes, thank you, Tang Tang. Shall we go for a walk? A lot happened in middle school, and I still want to thank you." [[17726 苏桃 happy]]
Tang Tang said, "Next time. I'm here on a task for my family. I hope you have a good time at the banquet." [[17727 唐糖 neutral]]
She waved and left the dance floor. [[17728 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao walked in the opposite direction, toward the back door of the hall, clearly wanting to go outside for some fresh air. [[17729 旁白 neutral]]
This scene fell into Chi Xiaocheng's eyes, making her let out a sigh of relief. [[17730 池小橙 happy]]
But when Su Tao hesitated to grab that person's wrist, it still made her heart ache. [[17731 池小橙 sad]]
Even if it was just for a moment. [[17732 池小橙 sad]]
Just for a moment! [[17733 池小橙 angry]]
She should only hold my hand. [[17734 池小橙 sad]]
Why does she have to touch someone else? [[17735 池小橙 sad]]
Ever since she became "not normal," her thoughts had been a bit extreme, and the word "security" meant more to her than ever before. [[17736 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had thought that once the affection and possessiveness levels reached the passing mark of 60, she could relax and let things develop slowly. [[17737 池小橙 neutral]]
But now it seemed she couldn't relax until they were at their maximum value. [[17738 池小橙 sad]]
As she sat on the windowsill in a daze, a familiar voice suddenly came from her side. "Ah, so you did run back on your own." [[17739 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng subconsciously turned her head and saw it was Si Chen. [[17740 旁白 neutral]]
The fact that a scarecrow could move was now revealed to someone else. [[17741 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng was in no mood to care about that right now. [[17742 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind was filled with the scene from just now. [[17743 旁白 sad]]
Her mind was filled with her Taotao. [[17744 旁白 sad]]
Si Chen walked to the window and looked at her curiously. "I knew something was wrong when I saw the red light in this doll's eyes. The camera is installed in the eyes, right?" [[17745 司辰 neutral]]
He clicked his tongue in praise. "You can't even tell this doll is a high-tech creation. Faking your own death, then secretly controlling this mechanical doll to watch Su Tao's every move... How did you get your hands on this high-tech stuff? I want one too." [[17746 司辰 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at Si Chen again. [[17747 旁白 neutral]]
People with high IQs really are different. [[17748 池小橙 neutral]]
They can figure things out on their own. [[17749 池小橙 neutral]]
If it were Dongfang Yang, he would definitely be shouting, "Whoa, a ghost!" or something like that. [[17750 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen picked Chi Xiaocheng up and said slowly, "There should be a listening device in the doll too, right? You're not talking, so it seems you didn't set up that function. Anyway, this fake death worked out well. Su Tao talks about you every day." [[17751 司辰 neutral]]
"And Chi Xiaocheng, you know me. I've always been on your side." [[17752 司辰 neutral]]
"So, I need to explain something to you. I, Si Chen, will never love Tao." [[17753 司辰 neutral]]
"Last time, I really thought you were dead, and I was afraid it would affect our plan, so I... uh... tested you. It was all an accident." [[17754 司辰 neutral]]
"Actually, I've already carved 'Never Love Tao' on my back, and even had it gold-plated. When you wake up someday, I'll find some time to show you." [[17755 司辰 neutral]]
"So, you should also calm down and think about it. I won't ask too much about your fake death, you know how it is. Now I'll take you back to Su Tao and pretend I just found you outside." [[17756 司辰 neutral]]
After carefully saying all this, Si Chen took her and started looking for Su Tao at the banquet. [[17757 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to Si Chen's explanation and concern, the System was far more nervous. [[17758 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, you have to calm down! Maybe Su Tao had her reasons for doing that. We barely got her affection level to the passing mark. If you pressure her now, it won't increase!] [[17759 系统 sad]]
[She's starting to like you. The old methods, like the 'dark room' and... acting like a yandere, won't work anymore.] [[17760 系统 sad]]
The System was worried that Chi Xiaocheng would lose her mind again. [[17761 旁白 neutral]]
But obviously, the worry was unnecessary. [[17762 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, Chi Xiaocheng would have thought she was just pretending to be a yandere. [[17763 旁白 neutral]]
But long ago, she had realized she wasn't normal, and still tried to think rationally. [[17764 旁白 neutral]]
It was the same now. [[17765 旁白 neutral]]
She replied in her mind, "System, don't worry. I know that pressure will never win Taotao's love. Only beautiful things, things that make people happy and feel good, can earn affection and fondness." [[17766 池小橙 neutral]]
"Originally, I was thinking that after I woke up, I would tell Taotao everything, and then we would live happily in our own little world." [[17767 池小橙 neutral]]
"But..." [[17768 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought of the data from her status glasses. "Affection can be nurtured slowly, but at least her possessiveness needs to be maxed out first, then Taotao won't look for anyone else, right?" [[17769 池小橙 neutral]]
She had a new plan for what to do after she woke up. [[17770 池小橙 neutral]]
