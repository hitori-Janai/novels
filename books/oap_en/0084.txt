Chapter 84: My Love for You is Fake [[7307 旁白 neutral]]
Her soft, brown hair was draped over her shoulders, and the cool light and shadow intertwined on Chi Xiaocheng's delicate, pale face. [[7308 旁白 neutral]]
The moment she saw Su Tao, a smile bloomed, revealing shallow dimples. [[7309 旁白 neutral]]
She looked especially cute like this. [[7310 旁白 neutral]]
This smile reassured Su Tao greatly. She carried some fruit and sat down beside Chi Xiaocheng, "How are you feeling?" [[7311 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat up a little, her voice lively, "The moment I saw Taotao, my body told me there was nothing wrong!" [[7312 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao lowered her head, tucked Chi Xiaocheng's fair, tender feet that were exposed outside the blanket back in, and then looked at her waist with a pained expression. [[7313 旁白 neutral]]
Almost instinctively, she said with concern, "Xiaocheng, don't hurt yourself next time, okay?" [[7314 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked, pretending not to understand, "Taotao, what are you talking about? I didn't hurt myself." [[7315 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao paused, a bitter smile flashing across her face, then she put on an indignant expression, "Damn Ye Liang!" [[7316 苏桃 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded in agreement, "My brother told me. It's a pity he didn't cripple him. He even dared to make Taotao his maid. I curse him to never get out of bed in the hospital!" [[7317 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao's mouth opened slightly. [[7318 旁白 neutral]]
Then she lowered her head and said nothing. [[7319 旁白 neutral]]
So, it was because of the maid? [[7320 旁白 neutral]]
Although the dark room incident was over, her being Ye Liang's maid was only put on hold. [[7321 旁白 neutral]]
And in Xiaocheng's eyes, even if this was avoided this time, it would still happen next time. [[7322 旁白 neutral]]
So she decided to go all out. [[7323 旁白 neutral]]
Forcing herself to completely break ties with Ye Liang! [[7324 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes were complex. [[7325 旁白 neutral]]
There was no blame in her gaze towards Chi Xiaocheng; this was just another version of self-inflicted suffering. [[7326 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng becoming a yandere, kidnapping herself in the basement, wanting to jump from the rooftop, and even this self-harm and framing. [[7327 旁白 neutral]]
All the consequences were caused by her own actions. [[7328 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao closed her eyes and slowly emptied her mind. [[7329 旁白 neutral]]
She let out a long sigh. [[7330 旁白 neutral]]
Forget it, what's done is done and can't be undone. Since she had already made a complete decision, she shouldn't think about Ye Liang anymore. His nature wasn't good either. [[7331 旁白 neutral]]
The important task now was to... [[7332 旁白 neutral]]
Soothe Xiaocheng's emotions, actively try to accept her yandere side, and take the first step towards gradual treatment. [[7333 旁白 neutral]]
After Su Tao figured this out, she slowly looked up. [[7334 旁白 neutral]]
She found that Chi Xiaocheng had been watching her, so their eyes naturally met. [[7335 旁白 neutral]]
The petite loli tilted her head and smiled, "What are you thinking about, Taotao?" [[7336 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's tone became much lighter, "I'm thinking about what hobbies Xiaocheng usually has." [[7337 苏桃 neutral]]
"Are we going to develop common hobbies?" Chi Xiaocheng's eyes lit up, her expectant expression like a child seeing a toy. [[7338 池小橙 happy]]
Then she said with a happy face, "This is indeed something couples do." [[7339 池小橙 happy]]
Couple. [[7340 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao naturally wouldn't admit to this identity, but going along with Chi Xiaocheng's meaning to soothe her emotions, she didn't directly deny it. [[7341 旁白 neutral]]
"What do you like to do when you're alone, Xiaocheng?" [[7342 苏桃 neutral]]
"Watch anime!" [[7343 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao continued to ask, "Then what kind of anime do you like to watch, Xiaocheng?" [[7344 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng answered innocently, "Anime about girls and girls." [[7345 池小橙 happy]]
Instantly, Su Tao's smile froze. [[7346 旁白 neutral]]
How was she supposed to respond to this topic? [[7347 旁白 neutral]]
Waiting online, it's urgent. [[7348 旁白 neutral]]
The observant Chi Xiaocheng noticed Su Tao's expression and slowly asked, "What's wrong, Taotao? Do you hate girls?" [[7349 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly shook her head, "No, I don't hate them." [[7350 苏桃 neutral]]
"Exactly." Chi Xiaocheng looked directly at Su Tao and slowly said, "Girls are fragrant, soft, super comfortable to hold, and obedient and well-behaved. They are simply the best treasures in the world!" [[7351 池小橙 happy]]
And the girl who was being stared at by those crimson eyes nervously looked away, "Y-yes." [[7352 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed again, "Alas, my brother also told me that boys are clumsy and not good, and that he wants to find a girl to take care of me in the future." [[7353 池小橙 neutral]]
As soon as she said this, it brought up a message Chi Song had asked her last time. [[7354 旁白 neutral]]
—Xiaotao, do you like my sister? [[7355 池松 neutral]]
Brother Chi Song wants to find a girl to take care of Xiaocheng, and be with Xiaocheng. [[7356 旁白 neutral]]
So that's why he messaged me then? [[7357 旁白 neutral]]
And just now, Auntie also seemed to imply that she wanted me and Xiaocheng to be together. [[7358 旁白 neutral]]
This... [[7359 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao shrank her neck, not daring to think further. [[7360 旁白 neutral]]
She also didn't want to continue this topic. [[7361 旁白 neutral]]
However, fortunately, Chi Xiaocheng in her normal state was thoughtful and considerate. [[7362 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps sensing her embarrassment, she yawned and lay down, "Taotao, I'm a little sleepy~" [[7363 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao came back to her senses, "If you're sleepy, then sleep. Your body hasn't recovered yet, rest is the most important thing." [[7364 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded and held out a small hand, "Then can Taotao hold my hand? Can you let go after I fall asleep?" [[7365 池小橙 neutral]]
"Of course." [[7366 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao took Chi Xiaocheng's right hand, transferring her own warmth. [[7367 旁白 neutral]]
She showed a gentle smile at the right time, and just watched Chi Xiaocheng fall asleep. [[7368 旁白 neutral]]
In less than ten minutes, the petite loli on the hospital bed was emitting steady, faint, and adorable snores. [[7369 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't help but reach out and smooth her hair. [[7370 旁白 neutral]]
She continued to sit there, looking at her face. [[7371 旁白 neutral]]
Cute. [[7372 旁白 neutral]]
Two words summarized everything about her. [[7373 旁白 neutral]]
The warmth transferred from her palm also made Su Tao feel enjoyment. [[7374 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, with her mind constantly tense, she wouldn't pay attention to so many details related to Chi Xiaocheng. Now, feeling it carefully, she increasingly felt that Chi Xiaocheng's skin was delicate and soft. [[7375 旁白 neutral]]
Her small hand was easy to hold, the back of her hand was smooth, her fingertips were tender, and the warmth it conveyed made her not want to let go. [[7376 旁白 neutral]]
However, from her wrist upwards, the part covered by the long sleeve, her smooth arm had some flaws. [[7377 旁白 neutral]]
It became even more obvious after gently pulling up the sleeve. [[7378 旁白 neutral]]
Some of the faded marks, Su Tao recognized at a glance as those left from the rooftop incident, which had almost disappeared by now. [[7379 旁白 neutral]]
But what happened in the past could not be erased. [[7380 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's mood sank slightly. [[7381 旁白 neutral]]
In the dark room, she had vaguely felt it. [[7382 旁白 neutral]]
Aside from the food always being terrible, every now and then, her sight and hearing would be deprived by Chi Xiaocheng. [[7383 旁白 neutral]]
During that time, Xiaocheng didn't know what she was doing. [[7384 旁白 neutral]]
But she could feel it. [[7385 旁白 neutral]]
That was Chi Xiaocheng's madness after becoming a yandere. [[7386 旁白 neutral]]
After becoming a yandere, she would want to hurt others, hurt herself. Perhaps she just couldn't control it and used pain to try to regain her sanity. [[7387 旁白 neutral]]
It was just that she had never dared to think in that direction and subconsciously avoided it. [[7388 旁白 neutral]]
No wonder the medical report said she was physically weak. [[7389 旁白 neutral]]
If she tried to accept her, would such things happen again in the future? [[7390 旁白 neutral]]
The thought alone was suffocating. [[7391 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't dare to think further and wanted to pull her hand away to rest. [[7392 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she got up, she was suddenly pulled back forcefully by Chi Xiaocheng. [[7393 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at Chi Xiaocheng, but found that the latter was sleeping soundly, and holding her hand was completely an unconscious reluctance. [[7394 旁白 neutral]]
The petite loli murmured in her sleep, "Taotao... don't abandon me..." [[7395 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao's heart softened again upon hearing this, and she sat back down, "Don't worry, Xiaocheng, I won't abandon you, never." [[7396 苏桃 neutral]]
Her voice was very soft, but Chi Xiaocheng seemed to have vaguely heard her words and mumbled in her sleep, "Taotao, I... like you, do you... like me?" [[7397 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's expression became complicated. She gently patted Chi Xiaocheng's small hand, "Xiaocheng, I like you too." [[7398 苏桃 neutral]]
However, I'm sorry, Xiaocheng, my love for you is fake. [[7399 旁白 sad]]
After silently adding this sentence in her heart, the hand that was holding her, not letting her go, loosened. [[7400 旁白 neutral]]
Until Su Tao left, she didn't notice that Chi Xiaocheng's lips had a faint smile from beginning to end. [[7401 旁白 happy]]
