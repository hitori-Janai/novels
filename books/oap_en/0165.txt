Chapter 165: Putting Herself in Danger [[14450 旁白 neutral]]
Taking a couple of deep breaths to compose herself, Su Tao opened the car door and got out. [[14451 旁白 neutral]]
With her hands in her black coat pockets, she stood on the dimly lit roadside, allowing the night's shadows to cover her. [[14452 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang stood at the hotel entrance. The light shined on his expensive watch, and he wiped the nasty smile off his face. "Su Tao, I knew you would come. Come in. I think we have had too many misunderstandings." [[14453 叶良 neutral]]
He turned to the side, making way at the hotel entrance and gesturing with his eyes for Su Tao to enter. [[14454 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at the tall and strong bodyguards beside her, and at the two men next to Ye Liang, before walking towards the hotel entrance. [[14455 旁白 neutral]]
The atmosphere was a bit tense, but Ye Liang didn't mind at all, walking with Su Tao toward the elevator. He said, "Su Tao, don't be so cold. We had such a good relationship two months ago. It's only because of a few misunderstandings that things have gotten to this point." [[14456 叶良 neutral]]
"While I was in the hospital, I did some self-reflection. I realize I was the problem. I ignored your feelings and was too arrogant. Even though I'm a grown man, I argued with Chi Xiaocheng. But you know me." [[14457 叶良 neutral]]
Arriving at the elevator, Ye Liang turned around and said with a very serious tone, "Because I like you, I love you very much, that's why I get angry when you ignore me." [[14458 叶良 neutral]]
As he spoke, he reached out a hand to stroke Su Tao's face. [[14459 旁白 neutral]]
However, Su Tao coldly slapped his hand away. [[14460 旁白 neutral]]
"You don't need to say these nice things to me. Do you think I'd still believe you?" [[14461 苏桃 angry]]
The elevator doors opened. Su Tao walked in without looking back, only turning to look at Ye Liang coldly once inside. "Stop flattering yourself. Your smile disgusts me." [[14462 苏桃 angry]]
The fake smile on Ye Liang's face froze. [[14463 旁白 neutral]]
He had imagined countless scenarios for his meeting with Su Tao. [[14464 旁白 neutral]]
He had also made predictions based on her personality. [[14465 旁白 neutral]]
With such a sincere apology letter, Su Tao's personality meant she should have been moved. After all, he had made it clear that Lin Fangya was the one who did it, so what did it have to do with him, Ye Liang? [[14466 叶良 angry]]
As for Chi Xiaocheng, he, this young master, had already said he forgave her and mourned her death, yet she still wouldn't forgive him. [[14467 叶良 angry]]
How ungrateful! [[14468 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang's expression turned a little unhappy, but he still forced a smile. [[14469 旁白 neutral]]
It didn't matter. Su Tao was on his territory now; she couldn't escape even if she grew wings! [[14470 叶良 angry]]
The elevator went all the way to the top floor of the hotel. [[14471 旁白 neutral]]
The super presidential suite, and above that was the rooftop swimming pool. [[14472 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang opened the door like a gentleman. "Come in. Misunderstandings need to be cleared up one by one. We can have a good talk." [[14473 叶良 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at the two bodyguards. "We can talk, but I don't want anyone to disturb us." [[14474 苏桃 neutral]]
"Of course." Ye Liang gave a wicked smile, which he quickly hid. He said to the two bodyguards, "Without my command, no matter what happens, you are not to come in." [[14475 叶良 neutral]]
"Understand?!" [[14476 叶良 angry]]
His sudden loud voice was like he was sending a signal. [[14477 旁白 neutral]]
The two bodyguards understood instantly. The young master wanted to do that kind of thing again. [[14478 旁白 neutral]]
So they nodded. "Yes, young master. Understood, young master." [[14479 陌生男1 neutral]]
The door closed. One of the bodyguards looked very envious. "This is great. Another beautiful girl this time. I think this Su Tao is the campus belle of Jiuzhou University. I really envy the young master's life." [[14480 陌生男1 neutral]]
The other bodyguard took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. "Should we go out for a bit? The young master usually doesn't like people eavesdropping when he's doing this sort of thing." [[14481 陌生男2 neutral]]
"Well... will there be any accidents?" [[14482 陌生男1 neutral]]
"What are you worried about? Our young master knows a few moves. What kind of accident could happen? It's not the first or second time. Is he going to get himself killed by her?" [[14483 陌生男2 neutral]]
"That Su Tao? A girl who is less than 1.7 meters tall and looks so delicate?" [[14484 陌生男2 neutral]]
This was not the first time something like this had happened. Tricking a girl into a room, and then nobody knew what he did. [[14485 旁白 neutral]]
As the young master, he was rich and powerful. Who could resist him? [[14486 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's thoughts were exactly the same as the two bodyguards'. Su Tao's suggestion was just what he wanted. [[14487 旁白 neutral]]
What was about to happen should not be disturbed by others~ [[14488 旁白 happy]]
Originally, Ye Liang wanted to trick Su Tao here and either ambush her on the way or assassinate her right here. Without their leader, Dongfang Yang and Si Chen would be a mess. [[14489 旁白 neutral]]
But after seeing Su Tao, Ye Liang changed his mind. [[14490 旁白 neutral]]
Such a slightly worn-out yet incredibly beautiful face, wasn't that what he was after from the beginning? [[14491 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't even imagine what the body hidden under this black coat would taste like! [[14492 旁白 happy]]
He had chased her for months, but he couldn't even hold her hand. [[14493 旁白 sad]]
But today, what he, Ye Liang, wanted to do was more than just holding hands. [[14494 旁白 happy]]
Walking into the living room, Ye Liang felt refreshed. He sat down on the sofa, crossed his legs, and said to Su Tao, "Go pour me a cup of coffee. You know how I like it." [[14495 叶良 neutral]]
It was just like before, back when he and Su Tao hadn't fallen out. [[14496 旁白 neutral]]
He would be sitting in his company office, and Su Tao would come to see him. [[14497 旁白 neutral]]
The first thing he would say was to ask her to pour coffee. [[14498 旁白 neutral]]
The girl would be a little reluctant, but she would still go and prepare coffee for him with a helpless look on her face. [[14499 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang enjoyed that feeling of being superior. [[14500 旁白 happy]]
This time, however, Su Tao didn't move as usual. She just stood in front of Ye Liang with her hands in her pockets. [[14501 旁白 neutral]]
With the bodyguards gone, Su Tao's eyes grew even colder. [[14502 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was in no hurry at all. He sighed helplessly, "Su Tao, if we're going to clear up the misunderstanding, we should at least calm down and talk, right? I told you, Lin Fangya did it. I can take you to see her tomorrow." [[14503 叶良 neutral]]
"Secondly," Ye Liang emphasized his next words, "I'm very sorry about Chi Xiaocheng's death. I was still in the hospital and had no idea about it. As soon as I found out, I immediately dealt with it, and I found her important belongings with Lin Fangya." [[14504 叶良 sad]]
"At the same time, I was worried that Chi Xiaocheng's parents would be affected by Lin Fangya, so I sent people to protect them." [[14505 叶良 neutral]]
"That Xiao Ming, your fiancé, was also Lin Fangya's accomplice. I caught him and asked him about your father." [[14506 叶良 neutral]]
"I think, if we are going to talk, we should both be calm, don't you think?" [[14507 叶良 neutral]]
Ye Liang still maintained his superior expression, then said two words, "Coffee." [[14508 叶良 neutral]]
Su Tao took a deep breath, clutching the small knife in her pocket. [[14509 旁白 neutral]]
Her loose hair covered her ears, and the high collar of her coat hid her pale neck. Outside, the night grew darker, and the expression on her face grew worse. [[14510 旁白 neutral]]
Beside her ear, hidden by her hair, was a delicate and tiny earphone. [[14511 旁白 neutral]]
A series of shouts came from the earphone. [[14512 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, calm down! Ye Liang is saying this on purpose. His goal might be to provoke you." [[14513 陌生人1 neutral]]
"You should have listened to us just now and not entered the hotel. We could have just surrounded the hotel, there was no need to put yourself in danger!" [[14514 陌生人2 neutral]]
"What you need to do now is to stall for time and prevent any accidents!" [[14515 陌生人3 neutral]]
