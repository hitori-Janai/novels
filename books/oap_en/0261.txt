Chapter 261: Leaving the Hospital, Going Home [[22241 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, after thinking for a long time, Chi Xiaocheng decided not to get rid of the special envoy. [[22242 旁白 neutral]]
After threatening him with poison, she used the System and spent a few hundred Emotion Points to leave a hook on him, then had him continue to hide by Xiao Ming's side. [[22243 旁白 neutral]]
He was also to contact her in secret. [[22244 旁白 neutral]]
This way, she would have a small spy on Xiao Ming's side. [[22245 旁白 neutral]]
Even if he really ran away, there was nothing she could do about it. [[22246 旁白 neutral]]
It would be fine if he revealed her current information to Xiao Ming; it would make him wary of her and continue to lay low. [[22247 旁白 neutral]]
If Chi Xiaocheng still couldn't take down a Dragon King with three years to prepare, she would have to fire the System. [[22248 池小橙 neutral]]
As for Lin Fangya, Chi Xiaocheng naturally didn't kill her. [[22249 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she handed her over to Special Envoy Qiu. [[22250 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng is so cute, how could she possibly hurt someone? [[22251 池小橙 neutral]]
She believed that Special Envoy Qiu would not let her down. [[22252 旁白 neutral]]
After returning safely to the hospital and changing her clothes, Chi Xiaocheng quickly fell asleep while thinking about her future plans. [[22253 旁白 neutral]]
The next morning, Chi Xiaocheng finished her breakfast, fed by Fang Ning, who had arrived even earlier than Su Tao. [[22254 旁白 neutral]]
Then she turned on the TV in her room and started watching. [[22255 旁白 neutral]]
Jiuzhou Television Station. [[22256 旁白 neutral]]
"Welcome to the morning news, where we bring you the daily news report for Jiuzhou City." [[22257 主持人 neutral]]
"Early this morning, a fisherman filed a police report. He was originally fishing in the river on the outskirts of Xiangyang North Road when he felt a strong pull on his line from a deep part of the water." [[22258 主持人 neutral]]
"He thought he had a big catch, but after pulling it up with all his strength, he discovered it was the body of a woman!" [[22259 主持人 neutral]]
"Next, let's connect with our reporter on the scene to ask the fisherman about the specific situation at the time." [[22260 主持人 neutral]]
Following the host's words, the broadcast quickly connected to the reporter on site at Xiangyang North Road. [[22261 旁白 neutral]]
Wasn't that near where Chi Xiaocheng was last night? [[22262 旁白 neutral]]
The rundown house and a nearby piece of land had been burned to ashes. [[22263 旁白 neutral]]
Once connected, the on-site reporter asked the fisherman, "Sir, could you please tell us about what happened in the early morning?" [[22264 记者 neutral]]
The fisherman, holding a fish, asked in confusion, "How did you know I caught a 10-jin grass carp?" [[22265 钓鱼佬 neutral]]
Reporter: "Um... I was asking about you catching the woman's body this morning." [[22266 记者 neutral]]
Fisherman: "This fish is 10.8 jin, which isn't that heavy. I caught a 12-jin one last time." [[22267 钓鱼佬 neutral]]
Reporter: "..." [[22268 记者 neutral]]
After some back and forth, the story was finally told, and by the end, Chi Xiaocheng didn't see any clues that could be related to her. [[22269 旁白 neutral]]
It was worth mentioning... [[22270 旁白 neutral]]
The police found large piles of poop everywhere in the grass, which seemed to mark the route the culprit took to escape. [[22271 旁白 neutral]]
Experts initially suspected this was a provocation and humiliation tactic from the suspect aimed at the police. [[22272 旁白 neutral]]
The Jiuzhou City Criminal Investigation Team has been dispatched and is determined to catch this "poop suspect"! [[22273 旁白 neutral]]
After watching the morning news, Chi Xiaocheng nodded with satisfaction. [[22274 旁白 happy]]
With the Cloak of Obscurity, she was sure she hadn't left a single clue behind last night. [[22275 旁白 neutral]]
As for the criminal investigation team tracking Special Envoy Qiu... [[22276 旁白 neutral]]
Let them go bother the esteemed Lord Dragon King. [[22277 池小橙 neutral]]
For Chi Xiaocheng, there was something even more important to do today. [[22278 旁白 neutral]]
Getting discharged from the hospital! [[22279 池小橙 happy]]
There was only one day left until New Year's Eve. Tomorrow night was the eve, and the morning after would be the Spring Festival. [[22280 旁白 neutral]]
There were fewer nurses and doctors in the hospital, and the streets were decorated with lanterns and festive decorations. [[22281 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't want to spend the new year in the hospital. Last night's banquet was a test for her body. [[22282 旁白 neutral]]
After confirming there were no issues, Professor Su began to handle the discharge procedures. [[22283 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Dongfang Yang and Si Chen also came to say goodbye to Chi Xiaocheng. [[22284 旁白 neutral]]
They were going back to the capital for the New Year. [[22285 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang would probably not be back until after the seventh day of the new year, while Si Chen could be back as early as the third day if he was quick. [[22286 旁白 neutral]]
In any case, they told her to contact them if she needed anything and to stay safe. [[22287 旁白 neutral]]
When she put on her thick down jacket and stepped out of the hospital entrance onto the melting snow, Chi Xiaocheng bathed in the sunlight and let out a comfortable sigh. [[22288 旁白 happy]]
"I'm finally out of the hospital. It was so boring in there, I was about to die of boredom." [[22289 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao, carrying the luggage and medicine, reached out and fondly stroked Chi Xiaocheng's head. "The most important thing is that you're healthy. But Xiaocheng, have you thought it through? Are you sure you don't want to go back to your hometown for the New Year?" [[22290 苏桃 neutral]]
"It would be a hassle to go back now, right? We can't get tickets, and even if we drove, we could borrow a car from Dongfang Yang, but what about the traffic jams along the way?" [[22291 池小橙 neutral]]
And safety was also an issue. [[22292 旁白 neutral]]
What happened with Lin Fangya last night had served as a warning to Su Tao. [[22293 旁白 neutral]]
As long as that woman was still around, there was still a potential danger. [[22294 旁白 neutral]]
It was fine not to go back. [[22295 旁白 neutral]]
She watched Chi Xiaocheng's small figure happily stepping on the snow, a smile of anticipation on her lips. [[22296 旁白 happy]]
A New Year with just her and Xiaocheng, how wonderful. [[22297 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao's steps became much lighter. [[22298 旁白 neutral]]
She walked ahead of Chi Xiaocheng and habitually took her hand. [[22299 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to interlock their fingers, just like she had done before. [[22300 旁白 neutral]]
But after grabbing the small hand, as her fingers began to close together, Su Tao clearly felt Chi Xiaocheng struggle and refuse. [[22301 旁白 sad]]
She just let her hand be held, then looked up in surprise and asked, "Sister Su Tao, what are you doing?" [[22302 池小橙 neutral]]
"Holding hands is fine, but why are you fidgeting with my fingers?" [[22303 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao paused for a moment, then smiled shyly. "It's nothing, Xiaocheng's hand is just so warm, I couldn't help but want to rub it a little." [[22304 苏桃 neutral]]
"Oh, then walk a little faster, okay?" [[22305 池小橙 neutral]]
The reply was a bit flat, but she didn't let go of the hand that was being held. [[22306 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a little disappointed, but she quickly cheered up and comforted herself. [[22307 旁白 neutral]]
Her relationship with Xiaocheng isn't at that stage yet, so there's no need to rush. [[22308 苏桃 neutral]]
She isn't rejecting me now. It's only a matter of time before she likes me again. This reaction is normal. [[22309 苏桃 neutral]]
I'll just have a good New Year with her and show her I care. At this rate, we should be able to get back to how we were before, right? [[22310 苏桃 neutral]]
No matter what, even though Xiaocheng's memory is confused, she must still like me subconsciously. [[22311 苏桃 neutral]]
After giving herself a pep talk, Su Tao walked along the street with Chi Xiaocheng. [[22312 旁白 neutral]]
In late February, winter was slowly coming to an end. New buds were sprouting on the tree branches, and spring was arriving. [[22313 旁白 neutral]]
The moment they returned to their apartment complex and walked into the room, a sense of familiarity washed over Chi Xiaocheng, making her feel at ease. [[22314 旁白 neutral]]
The rug on the floor had been put away by Su Tao, and the window shattered by the sniper rifle had been replaced with a new, reinforced bulletproof one. [[22315 旁白 neutral]]
Other than that, everything was the same as when she had left. [[22316 旁白 neutral]]
When she was a scarecrow, although this home hadn't changed, she had become countless times smaller, and many things in her vision had become huge. [[22317 旁白 neutral]]
Now that she was officially back, memories couldn't help but surface. [[22318 旁白 neutral]]
After standing at the door for a moment, Chi Xiaocheng heard Su Tao's worried question from beside her, "Xiaocheng, what's wrong?" [[22319 苏桃 sad]]
She seemed to be afraid that she would recover certain memories. [[22320 旁白 neutral]]
Especially those related to the now-repaired glass door. [[22321 旁白 neutral]]
