Chapter 103: Does She Really Like You? (Bonus chapter for Yi Zhi Xiao Sui Feng) [[8880 旁白 neutral]]
The blurry figure gradually became clear; it was her former self. [[8881 旁白 neutral]]
That very ordinary face, once so determined, slowly twisted. [[8882 旁白 neutral]]
Pedestrians pointed, cars honked endlessly, and raindrops pattered by her ears. The conversation between the ex-girlfriend and the man with the gold chain grew more mocking. [[8883 旁白 neutral]]
The blurry figure reached out a hand, trembling without stop. [[8884 旁白 neutral]]
His heart gradually twisted. [[8885 旁白 neutral]]
Amazingly, at that moment, Chi Xiaocheng could hear his thoughts. [[8886 旁白 neutral]]
"I liked you so much, I liked you so much, I liked you so much!" [[8887 人影 sad]]
"Why did you betray me! Why did you betray me! Why did you betray me!" [[8888 人影 angry]]
"Fake, fake, fake!" [[8889 人影 sad]]
Two years of good memories now haunted the figure like a nightmare. His outstretched hand still didn't dare to take the knife Chi Xiaocheng offered. [[8890 旁白 neutral]]
Then, the man with the gold chain wrapped his fat right hand around the ex-girlfriend's waist, stroking her while looking down arrogantly. [[8891 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if he was making a victor's announcement. [[8892 旁白 neutral]]
Often, it only takes one major event to twist a person's character. [[8893 旁白 neutral]]
The blurry figure suddenly gripped the small knife Chi Xiaocheng handed him. [[8894 旁白 neutral]]
Kill her if he couldn't have her? [[8895 旁白 neutral]]
No. [[8896 旁白 neutral]]
A scumbag like that shouldn't be left in this world! [[8897 旁白 angry]]
The figure's sudden outburst startled the man with the gold chain. He pushed his ex-girlfriend forward, and the knife sank deep into her stomach. [[8898 旁白 neutral]]
She looked up in disbelief, meeting the blurry figure's blood-red eyes. [[8899 旁白 neutral]]
Then she smiled sadly, "Ah Cheng, for a romantic like you, anyone you fall for is doomed to tragedy." [[8900 前女友 sad]]
The crowd's screams and the man's angry shouts drowned out the ex-girlfriend's voice. [[8901 旁白 neutral]]
Dark red blood flowed down, quickly washed away by the rain. The white rose on the ground slowly turned red, as if it had absorbed nutrients and was blooming eagerly. [[8902 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng just stood to the side, the anger in her heart slowly turning into confusion and fear. [[8903 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, she felt as if she was sharing the same feelings as her former self. [[8904 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng only came back to her senses when the red, washed by the rain, flowed to her feet. [[8905 旁白 neutral]]
She swallowed and kept telling herself, "This is just a dream. This never happened in my past life. I am Chi Xiaocheng now, and what's happening has nothing to do with me." [[8906 池小橙 neutral]]
After all, in her past life, she had just stayed home for three months after the breakup. [[8907 旁白 neutral]]
The police arrived. [[8908 旁白 neutral]]
The ambulance came too. [[8909 旁白 neutral]]
The ex-girlfriend had a hole cut in her stomach, and her former self was hit hard on the head by the man with the gold chain. [[8910 旁白 neutral]]
After emergency treatment, he was unconscious. [[8911 旁白 neutral]]
With a heavy heart, Chi Xiaocheng temporarily left the hospital, went back to her dorm, visited her ex-girlfriend's home, and followed the man with the gold chain for a while. [[8912 旁白 neutral]]
Rumors began to spread, and her former self, now in the hospital, became the talk of the school after meals. [[8913 旁白 neutral]]
More and more of his dark history was dug up. [[8914 旁白 neutral]]
It brought back bad memories for Chi Xiaocheng. [[8915 旁白 neutral]]
Her ex-girlfriend always came back late, saying she was busy with her part-time job. [[8916 旁白 neutral]]
Her best friend had contacted him, saying her private life was actually very messy. [[8917 旁白 neutral]]
There were always rumors at school about seeing her with some man, but they were just rumors, after all. [[8918 旁白 neutral]]
Because when they were together, Chi Xiaocheng didn't feel anything was wrong with her ex-girlfriend. [[8919 旁白 neutral]]
She only felt her immense affection. [[8920 旁白 neutral]]
So, no matter the rumors, Chi Xiaocheng chose to believe her. [[8921 旁白 neutral]]
And the result was... [[8922 旁白 neutral]]
Countless times of trust, and one betrayal shattered his faith. [[8923 旁白 neutral]]
Her former self wouldn't have thought about it in detail, but now the dream was showing a follow-up that had never happened in her memory! [[8924 旁白 neutral]]
All along, she had been played like a dog. [[8925 旁白 neutral]]
A life both ordinary and tragic. [[8926 旁白 neutral]]
Time flew, and her past self gradually woke up in the hospital. [[8927 旁白 neutral]]
He was supposed to be sent to the station for trial, but the diagnosis found that the patient had schizophrenia and was mentally ill. [[8928 旁白 neutral]]
As everyone knows, anything a mentally ill person does is considered normal. [[8929 旁白 neutral]]
He began to receive treatment listlessly, spending his days in the pain of hindsight. [[8930 旁白 neutral]]
He lived numbly for a long time, as if searching for his only light, his life partner, only to find out it was all a scam. [[8931 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't know how long the dream had lasted. She watched her former self escape from the mental hospital and start drinking heavily at home. [[8932 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps he was drunk, but the figure looked up, seeming to see Chi Xiaocheng, who had been transparent and detached from this world. [[8933 旁白 neutral]]
He asked faintly, "Aren't you angry?" [[8934 人影 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was stunned for a moment, then smiled, puzzled. "This is all made up. Why should I be angry? I was betrayed by her, then we broke up, a clean break." [[8935 池小橙 neutral]]
"The one in pain is you, trapped here." [[8936 池小橙 neutral]]
The figure smiled, "What? So you've already forgotten." [[8937 人影 sad]]
This conversation across time and space left Chi Xiaocheng a bit confused. [[8938 旁白 neutral]]
The figure took another sip of wine, his eyes listless and regretful, "Tell me, what was the point of the two years I invested?" [[8939 人影 sad]]
The question was for the figure himself, and also for Chi Xiaocheng. [[8940 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't answer, only feeling a dull ache in her heart. [[8941 旁白 neutral]]
The figure shook his head gently, "Forget it. This time, I'm going to make those two who deceived me pay!" [[8942 人影 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't interfere this time, because she felt it was harder than climbing the sky. [[8943 旁白 neutral]]
The ex-girlfriend was still in the hospital. [[8944 旁白 neutral]]
And the man with the gold chain was the big boss of some underground casino. [[8945 旁白 neutral]]
How could her ordinary past self possibly do it? [[8946 旁白 neutral]]
She watched as the figure scratched his own face to avoid being found by the mental hospital, while investigating the man with the gold chain and his ex-girlfriend. [[8947 旁白 neutral]]
As the "victim," he easily contacted the man, using the man's desire to have some fun with him. [[8948 旁白 neutral]]
Then, in his own room, he cut the man into pieces, leaving him there forever. [[8949 旁白 neutral]]
Being a patient himself, the figure easily entered the hospital. That night, the ex-girlfriend died in her hospital bed. [[8950 旁白 neutral]]
There was no satisfaction of successful revenge, only an endless emptiness that drove the figure to a cafe. [[8951 旁白 neutral]]
Along with him came two thugs selling "ice sugar". [[8952 旁白 neutral]]
With no will to live, his former self fought back without fear. [[8953 旁白 neutral]]
After that, the events were unfamiliar to Chi Xiaocheng. [[8954 旁白 neutral]]
After the figure was hospitalized again, not only did he not go mad, he seemed more and more like a normal person, the hole in his heart seemingly filled, completely forgetting what had happened in those months. [[8955 旁白 neutral]]
The medical report clearly stated—selective amnesia. [[8956 旁白 neutral]]
Discharged, he was secretly followed and observed by two plainclothes officers. [[8957 旁白 neutral]]
Then, there was a roaring truck. [[8958 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed the figure wasn't crazy, nor had he lost his memory. [[8959 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the truck charged, time stood still. [[8960 旁白 neutral]]
Her former self stood in front of the truck, asking Chi Xiaocheng softly, "Now, do you still think this is all fake?" [[8961 人影 neutral]]
"Is this really just a dream?" [[8962 人影 neutral]]
The words were asked by the figure but murmured from Chi Xiaocheng's mouth. [[8963 旁白 neutral]]
The figure turned around carefreely, "I've been wondering, was it that I couldn't forget Yiran, or that I was unwilling to accept it, or maybe I wanted to possess her. Now I'm starting to understand." [[8964 人影 neutral]]
"I just longed for someone to love me like that." [[8965 人影 sad]]
The experiences of the past few months had long since made the figure's eyes bloodshot. [[8966 旁白 neutral]]
That cognitive blur gradually transformed into Chi Xiaocheng's current appearance. [[8967 旁白 neutral]]
The two stood together, like looking in a mirror. [[8968 旁白 neutral]]
The figure, now transformed into "Xiaocheng," walked to Chi Xiaocheng's side, placed a small hand on her shoulder, his voice low and terrifying, "Do you really like Taotao? And does Taotao... really like you?" [[8969 人影 neutral]]
A cold sweat broke out. [[8970 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng suddenly sat up in bed, gasping for breath. [[8971 旁白 neutral]]
She turned her head to look at the figurine; it was still lifelike, unchanged. [[8972 旁白 neutral]]
Everything in the dream was so clear. [[8973 旁白 neutral]]
Was it all fictional content? [[8974 旁白 neutral]]
Or was it a forgotten, true memory? [[8975 旁白 neutral]]
No, none of that mattered. [[8976 旁白 neutral]]
The most important thing in the whole dream was just one thing! [[8977 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng reached out a trembling hand but couldn't grab her phone. Her whole body felt weak, and she could only roll off the bed and fall to the floor to frantically and anxiously touch the screen. [[8978 旁白 neutral]]
The call was dialed and connected. A sweet voice that was slightly reassuring sounded, "Xiaocheng, why are you calling me so late?" [[8979 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's hair was messy, her lips were dry, and she asked in a hoarse voice, "Taotao... do you really like me?" [[8980 池小橙 sad]]
