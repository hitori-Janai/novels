Chapter 152: Don't Leave Me All Alone! [[13407 旁白 sad]]
Blood slowly trickled from the corner of her mouth and her body as Chi Xiaocheng struggled to keep a smile, trying her best to look cute in her final moments. [[13408 旁白 sad]]
She motioned for Su Tao to come closer so she could hear her faint voice. [[13409 旁白 neutral]]
Her consciousness seemed to be fading, and Chi Xiaocheng could no longer pay attention to Su Tao telling her not to speak and to hold on. [[13410 旁白 sad]]
Her lips trembled slightly, and her voice grew hoarse. [[13411 旁白 sad]]
"Taotao, I really want to tell you, I've never... never blamed you." [[13412 池小橙 sad]]
"Even when you were dismissive of me, and said you were only pretending to like me, you... you still made time to see me, and I... I was very happy." [[13413 池小橙 sad]]
"But I'm a greedy person." [[13414 池小橙 sad]]
"Cough, cough, cough!" Chi Xiaocheng coughed up another mouthful of dark red blood, growing even weaker. "I don't want that fake affection. I want real love." [[13415 池小橙 sad]]
"When you started ignoring me, I got anxious. I... I really didn't know any other way to keep you by my side except by hurting myself." [[13416 池小橙 sad]]
"All I could think about was how much you cared for me on the rooftop, and I wished it could always be like that." [[13417 池小橙 sad]]
"But... I'm truly sorry." [[13418 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's smile gradually faded, like a wilting flower. [[13419 旁白 sad]]
Tears streamed down Su Tao's face as she held Chi Xiaocheng's hand to her forehead, her voice hoarse and pained. "Xiaocheng, please don't say any more, okay?" [[13420 苏桃 sad]]
"Silly Taotao, if I don't speak... I might fall asleep forever." [[13421 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's smile slowly stiffened, and the light in her eyes began to dim. [[13422 旁白 sad]]
"Taotao, if... if there's a next life, I won't pressure you anymore. I won't make you angry, I..." [[13423 池小橙 sad]]
"Don't say it, don't say it! I never hated you... I love you every day. I'm begging you, Xiaocheng... The ambulance is outside. Please, just hold on, okay?" [[13424 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao with difficulty. "Don't be sad for me. I'm very happy right now." [[13425 池小橙 happy]]
"Taotao isn't hurt..." [[13426 池小橙 happy]]
"And she won't be stressed because of me..." [[13427 池小橙 happy]]
"And no one will interfere with your life anymore..." [[13428 池小橙 happy]]
"In the future, if... if you meet someone else you like, please don't forget..." [[13429 池小橙 sad]]
"Never mind." At the last moment, Chi Xiaocheng let out a sudden, light laugh. [[13430 池小橙 sad]]
A strand of her hair swayed in the breeze, as if she were shaking her head in resignation. [[13431 旁白 neutral]]
"In the very end, forget me and start a new life." [[13432 池小橙 sad]]
I'm leaving, so I shouldn't let you keep worrying about me. [[13433 池小橙 sad]]
I shouldn't be so greedy. [[13434 池小橙 sad]]
Without a doubt, this is the happiest moment of my life. [[13435 池小橙 happy]]
"After all... right now, your eyes are filled with only me." [[13436 池小橙 happy]]
The dream she had always hoped for, the love she had always wanted, were all fulfilled in this moment. [[13437 旁白 neutral]]
Your eyes are filled with only me, with no room for anyone else. [[13438 池小橙 happy]]
Even if it's just for a little while, just for this moment, this instant. [[13439 池小橙 happy]]
"Taotao, can you confess your feelings to me one last time?" [[13440 池小橙 sad]]
I've always wanted to hear you say you like me from the bottom of your heart. [[13441 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao's tears fell onto Chi Xiaocheng's face as she nodded forcefully, her voice choked with sobs but firm. "Xiaocheng, I like... no, I love you!" [[13442 苏桃 sad]]
The words she had avoided for so long were finally spoken. [[13443 旁白 neutral]]
It was both the confession she had desperately hoped for and the goal and motivation that had driven her forward. [[13444 旁白 neutral]]
But. [[13445 旁白 sad]]
Whether this confession was true or false no longer mattered. [[13446 旁白 sad]]
Because she could no longer hear it. [[13447 旁白 sad]]
The moment Su Tao spoke, Chi Xiaocheng had already closed her eyes, her delicate hand slipping weakly from Su Tao's grasp. [[13448 旁白 sad]]
With a soft "thud," it fell heavily and limply onto the blanket on the floor. [[13449 旁白 sad]]
A faint, expectant smile still lingered on her lips. [[13450 旁白 sad]]
Hoping to hear her confession at the very end. [[13451 旁白 sad]]
And to be frozen in this moment forever. [[13452 旁白 sad]]
The words, spoken with such heavy emotion, could no longer reach Chi Xiaocheng's ears. [[13453 旁白 sad]]
As a small straw doll in Chi Xiaocheng's drawer shattered, a heart-wrenching scream rang out. [[13454 旁白 sad]]
"Xiaocheng!!!" [[13455 苏桃 sad]]
Her tears gradually turned red, and in that moment, Su Tao began to cry tears of blood. [[13456 旁白 sad]]
The blood on her chest had gradually dried, and those crimson, yet clear eyes, full of love and contentment, were now closed. [[13457 旁白 sad]]
Her lips were slightly parted, as if she wanted to say something. [[13458 旁白 sad]]
But she could never speak again. [[13459 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao hugged Chi Xiaocheng tightly, unable to accept this reality. [[13460 苏桃 sad]]
Tears streamed down her cheeks, gathered at her chin, and dripped onto Chi Xiaocheng's face before falling onto the blanket. [[13461 旁白 sad]]
As if trying to dilute the red staining the blanket. [[13462 旁白 sad]]
"Xiaocheng... don't leave me. Don't leave me here alone." [[13463 苏桃 sad]]
"Don't you love me? You haven't heard my confession yet. I love you too, I love you too!" [[13464 苏桃 sad]]
"Don't be so easily satisfied, okay? Don't look so content before you go, okay?" [[13465 苏桃 sad]]
"What do you mean, your eyes are filled with me? Aren't you greedy? Don't you want to possess me? Is this really enough to satisfy you?!" [[13466 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao's heart-wrenching sobs moved the security guards who were there to protect her. [[13467 旁白 sad]]
None of them spoke or exchanged words. [[13468 旁白 neutral]]
They just silently clenched their fists. [[13469 旁白 angry]]
They had been working here for a long time, so of course they knew Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao. [[13470 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, Chi Xiaocheng would sweetly greet everyone with "Uncle" or "Brother" and would even give them candy during their busy shifts. [[13471 旁白 neutral]]
And now, they were separated by death. [[13472 旁白 sad]]
The security captain remained silent for a long time before he finally walked over and patted Su Tao's shoulder. "Miss Su, the doctors are coming up in the elevator. Please..." [[13473 保安队长 neutral]]
...try to restrain your grief. [[13474 保安队长 sad]]
He couldn't bring himself to say those last two words. [[13475 旁白 neutral]]
But without a doubt, his words provoked Su Tao. [[13476 旁白 neutral]]
She glared at him with bloodshot eyes, completely breaking down. "What do you know? Xiaocheng will be fine! She's not dead! I forbid you from talking about her like that! She still has so much to say to me, how could she just leave like this?!" [[13477 苏桃 angry]]
As she spoke, Su Tao suddenly thought of something. [[13478 旁白 neutral]]
She hurriedly remembered, "That's right, you said you loved my lips the most!" [[13479 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao gently held Chi Xiaocheng, patting her cheek with one hand and urging anxiously, "Xiaocheng... Xiaocheng, think about it. Don't you love me? Don't you want to possess me? Don't you want me to kiss you forever? I won't hate it anymore, I promise." [[13480 苏桃 sad]]
"I'll kiss you right now. I'll experience it right now. Please, just wake up, okay?" [[13481 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao gently wiped the tears from the corners of Chi Xiaocheng's eyes and carefully held her pretty face. [[13482 旁白 sad]]
She gazed at those soft, warm lips, trying with all her might to feel a response. [[13483 旁白 sad]]
But no matter what, Chi Xiaocheng didn't respond as she always had before. [[13484 旁白 sad]]
Just then, Dongfang Yang burst in with Professor Su and other doctors, shouting, "Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao! Are you okay?!" [[13485 东方阳 angry]]
As soon as he stepped inside, he saw Su Tao holding Chi Xiaocheng on a blanket. The once-white blanket was now stained a deep, dark red where they sat. [[13486 旁白 sad]]
Dongfang Yang saw Su Tao's vacant expression, and the hand in his pocket trembled. "Hey, Su Tao, what happened? What's wrong with Chi Xiaocheng?" [[13487 东方阳 sad]]
Su Tao lifted her empty, lifeless eyes. [[13488 旁白 sad]]
Her lips trembled uncontrollably as she stared blankly at Dongfang Yang. "Hey, Dongfang Yang, why... why has Xiaocheng fallen asleep and won't wake up?" [[13489 苏桃 sad]]
