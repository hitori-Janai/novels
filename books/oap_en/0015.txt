Chapter 15: When Are You Coming Back? [[1284 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, you've seemed distracted ever since we finished dinner. Is something on your mind?" [[1285 叶良 neutral]]
At 8 PM, large raindrops began to wash over the city as twilight fell, carrying the earthy smell of rain. [[1286 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao and Ye Liang stood outside a shop under a dark and gloomy sky. [[1287 旁白 neutral]]
Having just finished dinner, they decided to wander around a bit before the 9 PM event started. [[1288 旁白 neutral]]
But the rain came without warning. [[1289 旁白 neutral]]
Along with the sound of the rain, Ye Liang carefully noticed that Su Tao didn't seem very enthusiastic. [[1290 旁白 neutral]]
Dressed in a simple white embroidered dress, she looked down, lightly tapping the floor with the tip of her shoe, lost in thought. [[1291 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang noticed this and tapped her on the shoulder. "What are you thinking about? You're so spaced out." [[1292 叶良 neutral]]
"Ah... oh, sorry." Su Tao forced a smile. "It's nothing, I was just thinking about Xiaocheng." [[1293 苏桃 neutral]]
Hearing that name, Ye Liang frowned slightly. "Why are you thinking about her? You two aren't the same kind of person. Su Tao, you should just cut ties with her instead of defending her." [[1294 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao opened her mouth, wanting to express her true feelings, but the memory of the scene in the basement stopped her. [[1295 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, she slowly asked, "Ye Liang, what kind of person do you think Xiaocheng is?" [[1296 苏桃 neutral]]
"Disgusting." [[1297 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang replied without hesitation. [[1298 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao gave a dry laugh. "Putting aside your later impressions, what about when you first met Xiaocheng and me?" [[1299 苏桃 neutral]]
Ye Liang looked at Su Tao, confused. [[1300 旁白 neutral]]
But her words still took his thoughts back to the summer vacation a few months ago. [[1301 旁白 neutral]]
He first met Su Tao in a clothing store. [[1302 旁白 neutral]]
He was hiding in the fitting room to avoid a woman from an arranged date, and by chance, Su Tao walked out. [[1303 旁白 neutral]]
She had just changed into a simple white long dress she was planning to buy. [[1304 旁白 neutral]]
Like a pure white fairy, she effortlessly captured everyone's attention. [[1305 旁白 neutral]]
After the two met face-to-face. [[1306 旁白 neutral]]
The woman from the arranged date came over to question him. [[1307 旁白 neutral]]
He ordered Su Tao not to reveal his location, offering her 100,000 yuan afterward. [[1308 旁白 neutral]]
Although Su Tao tried to cover for him, he was still discovered. [[1309 旁白 neutral]]
Faced with the questions, he had no choice but to say Su Tao was his girlfriend. [[1310 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, Su Tao not only went along with it but also confidently talked back to the shameless woman. [[1311 旁白 neutral]]
As the powerful young master of his family, it was the first time he had hidden behind a girl. [[1312 旁白 neutral]]
She had given him a gentle smile. [[1313 旁白 neutral]]
Looked at him with a reassuring gaze. [[1314 旁白 neutral]]
He was protected. [[1315 旁白 neutral]]
Afterward, because he had delayed Su Tao, Ye Liang offered her one million yuan as compensation. [[1316 旁白 neutral]]
Most people would have been too excited to speak when faced with such a huge amount of money. [[1317 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao calmly refused. [[1318 旁白 neutral]]
And she patiently comforted him, saying she was just doing a small favor. [[1319 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because of her "main character aura," after being rejected several times, Ye Liang found Su Tao very interesting. [[1320 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, her appearance was also a very important factor. [[1321 旁白 neutral]]
And so, his story with Su Tao began. [[1322 旁白 neutral]]
As for Chi Xiaocheng... [[1323 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang touched his chin and tried to remember again, only then recalling the tiny, almost unnoticeable person next to Su Tao. [[1324 旁白 neutral]]
"I think her makeup wasn't as crazy back then, just a little light makeup?" Ye Liang said, looking thoughtful. "I don't remember much, just that she's disgusting." [[1325 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao looked up at the cloudy sky and sighed. "Actually, Xiaocheng wasn't like this at first. She... she met some bad friends and was led astray." [[1326 苏桃 sad]]
As she spoke, Su Tao recalled their time in high school and couldn't help but chuckle. "Xiaocheng used to be so innocent, and she's actually quite cute without makeup." [[1327 苏桃 happy]]
Ye Liang gave Su Tao another strange look. [[1328 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't understand why Su Tao would talk about that person. [[1329 旁白 neutral]]
She was already so ugly with makeup. [[1330 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't imagine what Chi Xiaocheng would look like without it. [[1331 旁白 neutral]]
So he said forcefully to Su Tao, "Anyway, I can listen to you and not bother Chi Xiaocheng, but you have to listen to me and stop seeing her." [[1332 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao opened her mouth. [[1333 旁白 neutral]]
She lowered her head. [[1334 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't nod, nor did she shake her head. [[1335 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Ye Liang let out a displeased "Hm?" [[1336 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao flinched at the sound. "I actually want to try again. Xiaocheng was just led astray by others. She's a good person at heart. I don't want to give up on our friendship if I can help it." [[1337 苏桃 sad]]
"She did that to you, she kidnapped you! If I hadn't arrived in time, something terrible could have happened. Why do you still have hope for her?!" [[1338 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang couldn't understand Su Tao's way of thinking at all. [[1339 旁白 neutral]]
But he also felt helpless. [[1340 旁白 neutral]]
Because he liked her, he didn't want to be rough with Su Tao or force her to do anything. [[1341 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that Ye Liang seemed about to get angry, Su Tao weakly explained, "I'm an orphan. Ever since I met Xiaocheng in elementary school, we've been together. She was with me my whole childhood, like a sensible little sister. For the first time, I felt like I had a family." [[1342 苏桃 sad]]
"So I want to... try again." [[1343 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang raised his large hand, wanting to say something. [[1344 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, he dropped it heavily. [[1345 旁白 neutral]]
He scratched his head in frustration. [[1346 旁白 neutral]]
"People change!" he said, then changed the subject to avoid talking about it. "Forget it, let's not talk about that person. The event doesn't start until 9, but let's go over there first." [[1347 叶良 neutral]]
With that, he ordered Su Tao into the car and drove towards the beach in Jiuzhou City. [[1348 旁白 neutral]]
As Ye Liang drove, he said to Su Tao, "This event is being held on a large cruise ship by our families. If you wear this dress, you'll definitely amaze everyone!" [[1349 叶良 happy]]
"And my family will be there too. Su Tao, do you know what that means?" [[1350 叶良 happy]]
Ye Liang talked on, but when he glanced to the side, he saw Su Tao looking down at her phone. "Are you listening to me?" [[1351 叶良 angry]]
"Huh?" Su Tao immediately looked up, smiling sheepishly. "Um, could you say that again?" [[1352 苏桃 neutral]]
Ye Liang's voice sounded in her ear again, but her thoughts were still on her phone. [[1353 旁白 neutral]]
On it was a message Chi Xiaocheng had just sent. [[1354 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, it's almost 9 o'clock. Are you in the dorm? I'll come find you." [[1355 池小橙 neutral]]
I have to go to a party with Ye Liang at 9. [[1356 旁白 neutral]]
I wonder what Xiaocheng wants to tell me. [[1357 旁白 neutral]]
If it's just talking, we can do it over the phone, right? [[1358 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao thought for a moment and typed a reply, "Is something wrong, Xiaocheng? I can't get back by 9." [[1359 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's message came back instantly: "I need to tell you in person. Can you come back, Taotao?" [[1360 池小橙 neutral]]
"Sorry." Su Tao sent a cute, apologetic emoji. "I'm still out shopping with someone, so I won't be back so soon." [[1361 苏桃 neutral]]
Boom— [[1362 旁白 neutral]]
A clap of thunder sounded at that moment. [[1363 旁白 neutral]]
The rain grew heavier. [[1364 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as she sent the message, Su Tao regretted it. [[1365 旁白 neutral]]
It looked like a storm was coming, so her excuse was terrible. [[1366 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't dare say she was with Ye Liang, afraid of provoking Chi Xiaocheng. [[1367 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, Chi Xiaocheng's reply made her feel relieved, "So, will you come?" [[1368 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yes, yes, I'll be back as soon as I can!" [[1369 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao put down her phone, a relieved expression on her face. [[1370 旁白 neutral]]
This was a good sign. [[1371 旁白 neutral]]
As long as Xiaocheng was still willing to talk to her, there was a chance to restore their friendship. [[1372 旁白 neutral]]
Lifting her head, Su Tao brushed her hair back and happened to meet Ye Liang's displeased eyes. [[1373 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao gave a dry laugh. "I'll put my phone away now. I'm muting it." [[1374 苏桃 neutral]]
She turned off the sound on her phone and put it in her bag. [[1375 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't notice the next message from Chi Xiaocheng. [[1376 旁白 neutral]]
"Okay Taotao, I'll wait for you on the rooftop. When are you coming back?" [[1377 池小橙 neutral]]
Ten minutes later: "Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[1378 池小橙 neutral]]
Fifteen minutes later: "Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[1379 池小橙 neutral]]
Twenty minutes later: "Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[1380 池小橙 neutral]]
The rain fell harder and harder. [[1381 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[1382 池小橙 sad]]
