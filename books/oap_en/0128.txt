Chapter 128: A Yandere's Love is Deadly [[11263 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang, I like you." [[11264 池小橙 neutral]]
"Alright, I accept." [[11265 叶良 happy]]
Ye Liang wore a wicked smile, just like when he would later drop all pretense, wanting to devour them both in the snow. [[11266 旁白 neutral]]
Before she could even react, she heard Chi Xiaocheng say, "Then, Ye Liang, shall we go to my place?" [[11267 旁白 neutral]]
With a single "yes," the two of them walked home into the dusk. [[11268 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving Su Tao standing there, stunned. [[11269 旁白 neutral]]
At a complete loss. [[11270 旁白 neutral]]
"This... this isn't right, is it?" [[11271 苏桃 sad]]
"Why would Ye Liang agree to be with Xiaocheng? When he talked to me before, he clearly disliked her." [[11272 苏桃 sad]]
"In the end, Xiaocheng only confessed to Ye Liang for my sake, right? She was manipulated by that Zeng Xiu Hua, right? The goal was to make Ye Liang stay away from me?" [[11273 苏桃 sad]]
"But why would she bring Ye Liang home?" [[11274 苏桃 sad]]
"Isn't that the place where we live together?!" [[11275 苏桃 angry]]
The turn of events, so different from her memory, made Su Tao quickly follow them. [[11276 旁白 neutral]]
She had thought that Chi Xiaocheng, who was only confessing as an act, wouldn't get along with Ye Liang. [[11277 旁白 neutral]]
Who would have known that Chi Xiaocheng was actually laughing and chatting with Ye Liang! [[11278 旁白 neutral]]
They walked with their hands behind their backs, showing sweet smiles. [[11279 旁白 neutral]]
And the possessiveness on Ye Liang's face grew stronger and stronger. [[11280 旁白 neutral]]
A ridiculous sense of crisis suddenly arose in Su Tao's heart. [[11281 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if Chi Xiaocheng was really going to be stolen away by Ye Liang. [[11282 旁白 neutral]]
That's my Xiaocheng! [[11283 苏桃 angry]]
Besides, her impression of Ye Liang had already been completely ruined by their major fallout in the snow. [[11284 旁白 neutral]]
Her heart pounding with anxiety, she followed the two of them home. [[11285 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao watched as Ye Liang stepped inside. [[11286 旁白 neutral]]
Then, the situation took a sharp turn! [[11287 旁白 neutral]]
She had thought Ye Liang would take her place by Xiaocheng's side, but as soon as he stepped inside, a knife greeted him! [[11288 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was all too familiar with that knife. [[11289 旁白 neutral]]
It was the fruit knife they kept at home, and also the knife Chi Xiaocheng left in the bathroom at night. [[11290 旁白 neutral]]
*Swish—* [[11291 旁白 neutral]]
With her back to Ye Liang, Chi Xiaocheng stabbed him—the white knife went in, and came out red. [[11292 旁白 neutral]]
Like a madwoman, she stomped on Ye Liang's body, again, and again, and again, and again... [[11293 旁白 neutral]]
His face quickly became a blurry mess, and an eyeball flew out with Chi Xiaocheng's movements, rolling to Su Tao's feet. [[11294 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed to be staring at Su Tao with resentment. [[11295 旁白 neutral]]
As Chi Xiaocheng moved, a single sentence repeated in her ears. [[11296 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao is mine..." [[11297 池小橙 angry]]
"Taotao is mine." [[11298 池小橙 angry]]
"Taotao is mine!" [[11299 池小橙 angry]]
Gradually, Su Tao could no longer hear Chi Xiaocheng's voice; the shocking scene terrified her. [[11300 旁白 sad]]
The fear even overpowered the nausea she felt at the sight of all the red. [[11301 旁白 sad]]
After a long while, Chi Xiaocheng stuffed Ye Liang into the bottom drawer of the freezer, took a bath in the tub, and then went out with an innocent and cute smile. [[11302 旁白 neutral]]
The tub of clear water was stained with streaks of bright red. [[11303 旁白 neutral]]
She repeated the same process, appearing before Dongfang Yang. "Dongfang Yang, I like you!" [[11304 旁白 neutral]]
"Ha? You think I would be interested in a short and stupid little thing like you? But since you're inviting me to your place, I'll go with you, just so people don't say I'm not approachable." [[11305 东方阳 neutral]]
The scene Ye Liang had suffered replayed before Su Tao's eyes. [[11306 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because Chi Xiaocheng had a better impression of Dongfang Yang, this time she gave the sunny, arrogant boy a quick end, without torturing him. [[11307 旁白 neutral]]
She took another bath, and the bathtub turned even redder. [[11308 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said, "Si Chen, I like you!" [[11309 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen calmly took off his shirt, and the four characters "Never Love Tao" on his back glowed with a golden light. [[11310 旁白 neutral]]
Then he was put into the freezer by Chi Xiaocheng, one drawer above Ye Liang. [[11311 旁白 neutral]]
Three people in a row, all of whom had a good relationship with Su Tao at the beginning and had been "liked" by Chi Xiaocheng to some extent. [[11312 旁白 neutral]]
As a transparent observer, Su Tao couldn't stop it; she was already too scared to speak. [[11313 旁白 sad]]
Her sanity was like dancing on a tight string. [[11314 旁白 sad]]
But even though she was afraid, the dream didn't stop. [[11315 旁白 sad]]
Chen Qian was easily tricked into coming to the house by Chi Xiaocheng. [[11316 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Wei was sleeping, and as she slept, she fell into an eternal sleep. [[11317 旁白 neutral]]
Her friends, her mentor, everyone she had a decent relationship with, grew more and more distant, some even separated by death. [[11318 旁白 sad]]
And when Chi Xiaocheng faced the dream version of Su Tao, she was still just as sweet and obedient. [[11319 旁白 neutral]]
The clear water in the bathtub had long since turned deep crimson from Chi Xiaocheng's repeated washing. [[11320 旁白 neutral]]
Just like the red bathtub she saw when she came home tonight! [[11321 旁白 neutral]]
The only difference was that one person was missing from it. [[11322 旁白 neutral]]
At the very end, the dream version of Su Tao had no other friends left. [[11323 旁白 sad]]
But she didn't feel lost or lonely at all, because without friends, she still had a loving Xiaocheng by her side. [[11324 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Su Tao had hoped, Chi Xiaocheng became obedient, cute, and didn't cause trouble or get jealous over anyone. [[11325 旁白 happy]]
She never had another episode, enjoying every happy day. [[11326 旁白 happy]]
Until the end of the dream. [[11327 旁白 neutral]]
She stood watching from a distance as the Xiaocheng who had killed so many people suddenly turned to look at her. [[11328 旁白 neutral]]
A twisted, sickly smile spread across her face. [[11329 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, I like you!" [[11330 池小橙 happy]]
Fear pricked her back like needles. Su Tao woke with a start, her bangs stuck to her forehead with sweat. [[11331 旁白 sad]]
She gasped for air, the sensations from the dream feeling incredibly real. [[11332 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao listlessly scanned the room. [[11333 旁白 neutral]]
Only after confirming she was no longer in the dream did she lean back weakly against the pillow. [[11334 旁白 sad]]
The sky was not yet bright. [[11335 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't dare to sleep again. [[11336 旁白 sad]]
She just pulled the blanket over her head, and a series of "I'm sorry"s gradually came from under the covers. [[11337 苏桃 sad]]
She understood that the Xiaocheng in her dream was the fully realized yandere. [[11338 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng was still lying in a hospital bed now, as if she had entrusted the dream to her. [[11339 旁白 neutral]]
—I like you, I've always liked you, then and now. [[11340 池小橙 sad]]
—But why don't you want me anymore? [[11341 池小橙 sad]]
—Why? Why? Why? Why? [[11342 池小橙 sad]]
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." [[11343 苏桃 sad]]
The repeated apologies were only for her own psychological comfort. [[11344 旁白 sad]]
Exhaustion washed over her body, until Qian Qing knocked on the door. [[11345 旁白 neutral]]
With her hair in a mess, Su Tao looked at her. "Miss Qian, what is it?" [[11346 苏桃 neutral]]
Qian Qing held a blanket and yawned. "I knew you couldn't sleep. Just now, someone named Chen Qian, who said she's your roommate, rang the doorbell in the middle of the night to give you this." [[11347 钱清 neutral]]
Qian Qing tossed it, and a sachet with an orange pattern landed on the bed. [[11348 旁白 neutral]]
"Your roommate said you might sleep better with this." Qian Qing took another look at Su Tao, hesitated, but didn't say anything more. "Also, don't overthink it. Get some sleep." [[11349 钱清 neutral]]
With that, she closed the door. [[11350 旁白 neutral]]
It was only 4 a.m., and the winter night was longer than usual. [[11351 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stared blankly at the sachet, then quickly picked it up and held it to her chest. [[11352 旁白 neutral]]
She buried her nose in the sachet, greedily breathing in its scent as if clinging to a lifeline. [[11353 旁白 sad]]
"Xiaocheng..." [[11354 苏桃 sad]]
Tears slid from the corners of Su Tao's eyes again. [[11355 旁白 sad]]
She finally understood why the sachet's scent had always felt familiar, pleasant, and likable. [[11356 旁白 neutral]]
Wasn't this sachet the scent of Chi Xiaocheng? [[11357 旁白 neutral]]
It was exactly the same. [[11358 旁白 neutral]]
The person she feared was Chi Xiaocheng. [[11359 旁白 sad]]
But in the end, the person who supported her was also Chi Xiaocheng. [[11360 旁白 neutral]]
How ridiculous. [[11361 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao laughed at herself, her hand clutching the sachet never loosening its grip. [[11362 旁白 sad]]
