Chapter 140: After intersecting, straight lines only move further apart. [[12329 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's ears were ringing, and the words Chi Xiaocheng had just shouted echoed in her mind. [[12330 旁白 neutral]]
Was I being insincere? [[12331 苏桃 neutral]]
I don't think so. [[12332 苏桃 neutral]]
Whether it was caring for Chi Xiaocheng's mental well-being or racking her brains for a way to solve her yandere tendencies. [[12333 旁白 neutral]]
She had saved all the methods from several doctors, including a netizen named Cheng Cheng, along with all the precautions, on her phone. [[12334 旁白 neutral]]
She never used to browse online forums, but recently she had even joined some groups for yandere character fans. [[12335 旁白 neutral]]
It was all to understand Chi Xiaocheng's situation and find the right way to help. [[12336 旁白 neutral]]
She was incredibly serious when it came to this matter. [[12337 旁白 neutral]]
Even in her feelings, she had never been insincere. [[12338 旁白 neutral]]
When she had to force herself to do something, she would do it decisively. [[12339 旁白 neutral]]
Like all those times she expressed her affection for Chi Xiaocheng. [[12340 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't being insincere, just evasive. [[12341 旁白 neutral]]
She knew this well, but how could she explain it to Chi Xiaocheng? [[12342 旁白 neutral]]
She opened her mouth, but no words came out. [[12343 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng was walking toward Su Tao, step by step. [[12344 旁白 neutral]]
The strong liquor had already spilled on the floor, and those bewitching, cat-like eyes once again filled her with fear and pressure. [[12345 旁白 neutral]]
Even though it was just a low-level skill. [[12346 旁白 neutral]]
But for Su Tao, who was already under immense pressure, this little bit of fear could be the straw that broke the camel's back. [[12347 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng kept replaying the rejection on the broken bridge in her mind, venting her dissatisfaction and despair at Su Tao. [[12348 旁白 neutral]]
"How many times has it been, Taotao?" [[12349 池小橙 angry]]
"From the very beginning until now, how many times have you told me you like me, and how many of those times did you actually mean it!" [[12350 池小橙 angry]]
"You rejected my confession! You kept saying you liked me, but you avoided the question I asked you." [[12351 池小橙 angry]]
"And after we left the police station? You knew I was scared and hurt. You kept saying you cared about me, but what did you do?" [[12352 池小橙 angry]]
"You went to see your fiancé! You went to him the moment he came back!" [[12353 池小橙 angry]]
"You broke our promise, so how can you still smile and say you like me!" [[12354 池小橙 angry]]
As she spoke, a tear rolled down Chi Xiaocheng's cheek, her smile tragic. "Did you forget, Taotao? We made a pinky promise." [[12355 池小橙 sad]]
The moment Dark Xiaocheng left, Chi Xiaocheng understood. [[12356 旁白 neutral]]
This whole idea of slowly winning Taotao over, of acting obedient to make her fall in love... [[12357 旁白 neutral]]
It was simply impossible! [[12358 旁白 neutral]]
If she didn't hold on to Taotao, she would leave for all sorts of reasons and eventually forget her. [[12359 旁白 neutral]]
"So, Taotao." [[12360 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wiped away her tear with the back of her hand and smiled again. "After what happened, after nearly dying, I realized something. I want you by my side forever, and the best way to do that is..." [[12361 池小橙 neutral]]
"...to possess you completely!" [[12362 池小橙 happy]]
Pressure? [[12363 旁白 neutral]]
Not really. She was just revealing her original self and pouring out her heart. [[12364 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned around and picked up another glass of strong liquor. [[12365 旁白 neutral]]
She held it out to Su Tao. "Here, Taotao. Drink this, say you love me, and I might forgive you just a little bit." [[12366 池小橙 neutral]]
Now, how are you going to escape this time? [[12367 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pressed against the glass kitchen door, looking at Chi Xiaocheng with a complex expression, a hidden hand trembling behind her back. [[12368 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, Chi Xiaocheng made her feel only one thing. [[12369 旁白 neutral]]
Unfamiliar. [[12370 旁白 neutral]]
If she could still see a shadow of her childhood friend in the obedient Xiaocheng, the Chi Xiaocheng now, with her red eyes and undisguised possessiveness, was completely separate from that memory. [[12371 旁白 neutral]]
No... [[12372 旁白 neutral]]
Not just now. Ever since the basement, the girl in her memories and the girl in reality had been drifting further and further apart. [[12373 旁白 neutral]]
Love her... [[12374 旁白 neutral]]
Could she never escape this curse? [[12375 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao reached out a trembling hand and took the glass. [[12376 旁白 neutral]]
She had no choice. [[12377 旁白 neutral]]
To think she was told not to provoke Xiaocheng again. [[12378 旁白 neutral]]
From the very beginning, she was already on the path to corruption. [[12379 旁白 neutral]]
Fear and rejection flooded her heart again, just like... [[12380 旁白 neutral]]
"Aren't you going to drink?" [[12381 池小橙 neutral]]
A soft voice whispered in her ear. [[12382 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, just like that time on the rooftop. [[12383 旁白 neutral]]
If she refused, Chi Xiaocheng would only become more unhinged. [[12384 旁白 neutral]]
She could only keep catering to her desires, saying what she wanted to hear, gradually becoming a puppet, or perhaps... [[12385 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao gave a miserable smile that looked like she was about to break. "Xiaocheng, if I drink this, will you listen to me?" [[12386 苏桃 sad]]
"I won't." [[12387 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's refusal was clear. [[12388 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's mouth opened in a bitter smile. "Why? I've always liked the more obedient you. I'm definitely not lying about that." [[12389 苏桃 sad]]
"You certainly aren't lying." Chi Xiaocheng chuckled. "The obedient Xiaocheng is gone now. You chose this, didn't you, Taotao?" [[12390 池小橙 neutral]]
Yes, it was all her choice. [[12391 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't cherish the two weeks when she was obedient. [[12392 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that Chi Xiaocheng was about to reach for a knife again, Su Tao gritted her teeth, raised the glass, and poured the strong liquor down her throat. [[12393 旁白 neutral]]
Gulp... Gulp... [[12394 旁白 neutral]]
Her throat moved as she swallowed. The high-proof alcohol was not something an ordinary person could handle. [[12395 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyebrows knitted together. Before she could even finish the glass, her legs gave out and she fell to her knees, gasping for breath. [[12396 旁白 neutral]]
Awful, awful, awful, awful, so awful... [[12397 旁白 neutral]]
Hate it, hate it, hate it... [[12398 旁白 neutral]]
Why do you keep forcing me? Is your love really so strange? [[12399 旁白 neutral]]
This Xiaocheng, is there really any chance of curing her? [[12400 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao turned her head and saw that Chi Xiaocheng had knelt down beside her at some point, her voice full of pain. "Taotao, you've always hated me, haven't you?" [[12401 池小橙 sad]]
"I know. You always look so uncomfortable, but you still force yourself to say you like me." [[12402 池小橙 sad]]
"I don't mind that you pretend to like me because you hate me." [[12403 池小橙 neutral]]
If it was that kind of pretense, Chi Xiaocheng certainly didn't mind. [[12404 旁白 neutral]]
The only thing she couldn't accept was the pretense of liking and loving her. [[12405 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't know how much time had passed before Chi Xiaocheng gently lifted her weakened body. [[12406 旁白 neutral]]
"If you're tired, Taotao, you should rest for a bit." [[12407 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng placed Su Tao on the sofa and went back into the kitchen by herself. [[12408 旁白 neutral]]
She paid no attention to Su Tao's pained and conflicted expression. [[12409 旁白 neutral]]
Because Chi Xiaocheng had already decided. No matter what nice things Su Tao said, she wouldn't change her mind. [[12410 旁白 neutral]]
She would no longer be the obedient Xiaocheng. [[12411 旁白 neutral]]
If you're going to like me, you'll like the me I am now! [[12412 旁白 neutral]]
No, you must like the me I am now! [[12413 旁白 neutral]]
Obsessive, unhinged. [[12414 旁白 neutral]]
While Chi Xiaocheng was lost in this state, she herself had forgotten something fundamental. [[12415 旁白 neutral]]
Could such heavy and painful feelings truly make someone fall in love? [[12416 旁白 neutral]]
With her back to Su Tao, she put the first-aid kit away again. [[12417 旁白 neutral]]
When she turned to look at Su Tao, she found that Su Tao was also looking at her. [[12418 旁白 neutral]]
Their eyes met for a brief moment. [[12419 旁白 neutral]]
Then they both looked away. [[12420 旁白 neutral]]
It was like two lines that had once intersected. [[12421 旁白 neutral]]
After intersecting, they would only move further and further apart. [[12422 旁白 neutral]]
