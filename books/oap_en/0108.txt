Chapter 108: Don't Like Cats, Only Me [[9391 旁白 neutral]]
The journey was peaceful, but since leaving home, Chi Xiaocheng could always feel a faint warning from her "Alert" skill. [[9392 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like someone was secretly watching her. [[9393 旁白 neutral]]
She looked around but couldn't find the dark Xiaocheng, whose appearance always made her heart ache. [[9394 旁白 neutral]]
She thought that the dark Xiaocheng was probably watching her from somewhere in the shadows. [[9395 池小橙 neutral]]
That dark Xiaocheng will harm me! [[9396 池小橙 sad]]
That's why the "Alert" skill was giving a faint warning. [[9397 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, that figure was nowhere to be seen inside the cat cafe. [[9398 旁白 neutral]]
After completely relaxing, Chi Xiaocheng noticed that many cats were looking at her. A bold orange cat had already rolled to her feet, gently rubbing against her boots and meowing cutely. [[9399 旁白 happy]]
Led by this orange cat, many other playful kittens gathered around. [[9400 旁白 neutral]]
The young lady holding a cat chuckled softly, "It seems they really like you." [[9401 徐然 happy]]
Seeing this, Su Tao stopped worrying about the previous issue. She handed two red bills to the young lady and said, "We'll be intruding then." [[9402 苏桃 neutral]]
Two hundred yuan for two people to play with cats all day. [[9403 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng had already picked up the chubby orange cat, watching with amusement as other cats came to snuggle. [[9404 旁白 happy]]
The "Affinity" skill was constantly working. [[9405 旁白 neutral]]
She cast a pleading look toward Su Tao, "Taotao, help me." [[9406 池小橙 sad]]
"This is proof that they like you. Just relax and have a good time here~" [[9407 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao crouched down and gently beckoned to a small white cat. [[9408 旁白 neutral]]
As the female lead, her affinity was naturally high. [[9409 旁白 neutral]]
The once-timid white cat mustered its courage and jumped into Su Tao's arms. After a gentle scratch on its chin, both the kitten and its master revealed satisfied and happy smiles. [[9410 旁白 happy]]
Seeing this reflected in her eyes, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but smile. [[9411 旁白 happy]]
Holding the big orange cat, she sat down on a blanket. [[9412 旁白 neutral]]
The young lady at the cat cafe was named Xu Ran. After high school, she didn't have the money for university and didn't want to earn it dishonestly. After working odd jobs and collecting bottles for a few months, she unexpectedly met Dongfang Yang. [[9413 旁白 neutral]]
Because of her high affinity with cats, she was appointed as the manager of this small shop. [[9414 旁白 neutral]]
After getting to know Su Tao, the two of them talked endlessly. [[9415 旁白 neutral]]
They were like two parents meeting for the first time. [[9416 旁白 neutral]]
Xu Ran talked about the two high school girls working at the cafe, while Su Tao's conversation always came back to Chi Xiaocheng. [[9417 旁白 neutral]]
Both were reminiscing about the past. [[9418 旁白 neutral]]
Nearby, the subject of their conversation perked up her ears. Hearing Su Tao's praise, she wasn't as happy as she had imagined. [[9419 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was praising her. [[9420 旁白 neutral]]
But it wasn't really *her* she was praising. [[9421 旁白 sad]]
She had arrived in this world in November. [[9422 旁白 neutral]]
All together, it had only been a month and a week. [[9423 旁白 neutral]]
This period of time was her true self. [[9424 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao's praise was for the Xiaocheng from high school. [[9425 旁白 sad]]
Her good mood gradually faded with these sinking thoughts. [[9426 旁白 sad]]
Just then, the hem of a black formal dress came into view. [[9427 旁白 neutral]]
A single finger touched one of the cats beside her. [[9428 旁白 neutral]]
She glanced over. [[9429 旁白 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng, emitting a dark aura, was squatting on the floor hugging her knees, smiling faintly. "You still don't get it? Su Tao cares about the Xiaocheng from her memories, not you." [[9430 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
The sudden appearance prevented her "Alert" skill from giving a warning. [[9431 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pouted, her mood worsening considerably. [[9432 旁白 sad]]
She couldn't help but turn to look at Su Tao. [[9433 旁白 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng had somehow appeared on her other side, putting an arm around her shoulder and pointing at Su Tao. "Did you hear what she said? The little Xiaocheng, the high school Xiaocheng, the wonderful times in the countryside—but nothing about the Xiaocheng from this past month at university." [[9434 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"Pretending to be obedient won't win her affection or her heart." [[9435 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng bit her lip, speaking in a voice only she could hear, "You're wrong, Taotao cares about me!" [[9436 池小橙 angry]]
Dark Xiaocheng gave a wicked smile, "What's the use of caring? Think about Yiran. She used to act like she cared so much, telling you she liked you every day. But what happened? Her 'like' for you was just someone else's command!" [[9437 漆黑小橙 angry]]
"Right now, Su Tao would rather hold a kitten than you~" [[9438 漆黑小橙 angry]]
Little by little, the voice that wanted her to possess Su Tao echoed in her ear again. [[9439 旁白 sad]]
She could never win Su Tao's affection; possessing her was the only way! [[9440 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng shot up to her feet and bit her tongue hard. [[9441 旁白 neutral]]
The pain brought her back to her senses. [[9442 旁白 neutral]]
I can't just possess her like that. [[9443 池小橙 sad]]
I can't listen to this dark Xiaocheng. [[9444 池小橙 sad]]
Taotao still cares about me and said she likes me. If I make her unhappy, if I try to forcefully possess her... [[9445 池小橙 sad]]
She definitely wouldn't like that. [[9446 池小橙 sad]]
She would be upset. [[9447 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao with a heavy heart, put down the cat in her arms, and carefully walked over. [[9448 旁白 neutral]]
Xu Ran and Su Tao both looked at Chi Xiaocheng with confusion. [[9449 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng put her hands behind her back, both nervous and a little scared. "Don't... don't hold the cat anymore. Can you hold me instead?" [[9450 池小橙 sad]]
Xu Ran was stunned for a moment, then gave Su Tao a deep look. [[9451 旁白 neutral]]
A smile of understanding instantly appeared on her face. [[9452 徐然 happy]]
"Old Eight, come here." [[9453 徐然 neutral]]
With a gentle beckoning of her finger, the little white cat in Su Tao's arms jumped into Xu Ran's. [[9454 旁白 neutral]]
She said to the two of them, "I need to go supervise those two girls with their homework. You two can do as you please. There are snacks at the bar, and let me know if you want coffee." [[9455 徐然 neutral]]
With that, she left the seat, holding the cat. [[9456 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng still had her head down, looking like a child who had done something wrong. [[9457 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao crossed her legs and asked curiously, "Why does Xiaocheng want a hug all of a sudden?" [[9458 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng bit her lip, the two sentences from before still echoing in her mind. [[9459 旁白 neutral]]
*She'd rather hold a cat than you.* [[9460 旁白 neutral]]
*It's just a cat, how can it compare to me!* [[9461 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng huffed softly, "I'm jealous." [[9462 池小橙 angry]]
Hearing this, Su Tao's mouth fell slightly open, completely caught off guard by the answer. [[9463 旁白 neutral]]
Jealous? [[9464 苏桃 neutral]]
Of a cat? [[9465 苏桃 neutral]]
She didn't know whether to laugh or cry. She patted her lap, "Come sit here." [[9466 苏桃 happy]]
Holding the small, soft body in her arms, a sweet feeling filled Su Tao's heart. [[9467 旁白 happy]]
When someone tells you to your face that they're jealous and want a hug for comfort, the emotional value they provide is immense. [[9468 旁白 happy]]
Affection, care, and possessiveness were all perfectly displayed in that short sentence. [[9469 旁白 happy]]
And the person being liked, no matter how they tried to hide it, couldn't help but be moved. [[9470 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng buried her face in Su Tao's embrace and whispered softly in her ear. [[9471 旁白 neutral]]
Then came a soft and shy voice, "Meow~" [[9472 池小橙 happy]]
It felt like an electric current spreading from her earlobe to her whole body. [[9473 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the person in her arms with a stunned expression. [[9474 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said boldly, "The kittens here aren't as cute as me, you know." [[9475 池小橙 happy]]
She lifted her head from its hiding place. [[9476 旁白 neutral]]
Obedient and clingy. [[9477 旁白 neutral]]
A moment of hesitation flashed through Su Tao's mind. [[9478 旁白 neutral]]
She glanced at Xu Ran at the counter and pulled back. [[9479 旁白 sad]]
But an alluring voice suddenly whispered in her ear. [[9480 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm?" [[9481 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao looked down in surprise, only to find that Chi Xiaocheng had closed her eyes. [[9482 旁白 neutral]]
Delicate and tempting, there was no other way to describe it. [[9483 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao couldn't help but swallow, her breathing gradually quickening. [[9484 旁白 happy]]
