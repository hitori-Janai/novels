Chapter 22: Don't Worry, I'm Not Really a Yandere [[1941 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ugh..." [[1942 池小橙 sad]]
    My head hurts so much, I'm so tired, it feels like my body is falling apart. [[1943 池小橙 sad]]
    Pale light fell from above, shining on a clean white hospital bed. Chi Xiaocheng's thin and delicate body was covered by layers of white sheets. The smell of disinfectant in the air and the weakness from her body made her slowly wake up. [[1944 旁白 neutral]]
    "How long was I unconscious?" [[1945 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng didn't speak out loud, but asked the System in her mind while squinting her eyes, trying to get used to the hospital lights. [[1946 旁白 neutral]]
    She might be unconscious, but the System wouldn't be. [[1947 旁白 neutral]]
    [Host was unconscious for three hours. It's now 1 AM. Host is in Jiuzhou City Third People's Hospital. Su Tao and Dongfang Yang brought you here] [[1948 系统 neutral]]
    "There's one extra person beyond what I planned. Dongfang Yang is that kind of smart and warm-hearted cheerful guy, right? Having him around Su Tao makes things a bit difficult. A romantic moment between just the two of us would be much better." [[1949 池小橙 neutral]]
    The System heard Chi Xiaocheng's complaint and couldn't help but fall silent for a moment. [[1950 旁白 neutral]]
    [Host, at a time like this, you're still thinking about such things! I told you to get more energy, but you didn't listen. Otherwise, you wouldn't have fainted from weakness!] [[1951 系统 angry]]
    Chi Xiaocheng opened her eyes and stared blankly at the ceiling. [[1952 旁白 neutral]]
    A smile appeared on her lips, "I have to put on a complete show. I showed Su Tao all those injuries on purpose. If my body was still as strong as a bull, wouldn't people get suspicious? I can fool Su Tao, but I can't fool the doctors." [[1953 池小橙 happy]]
    [But you didn't have to hurt yourself so badly! Doesn't it hurt?] [[1954 系统 sad]]
    "It actually hurts quite a bit," Chi Xiaocheng replied. "If I didn't have the pain reduction skill, I probably couldn't have kept going. The intermediate acting skill is truly amazing. Without this acting ability, this action wouldn't have been so effective." [[1955 池小橙 neutral]]
    After all, her performance back then was indeed quite shocking. [[1956 旁白 neutral]]
    She was afraid Su Tao wouldn't be able to accept it. [[1957 池小橙 neutral]]
    If Su Tao could have a thought like "I must side with Xiaocheng, or she might get into trouble" every time she sees Ye Liang in the future, that would be perfect! [[1958 池小橙 happy]]
    "System, how many Emotion Points do I have now?" [[1959 池小橙 neutral]]
    [2135 points. Su Tao provided 1400 points for the host, and the rest came from Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang, with Ye Liang providing nearly 500 points] [[1960 系统 neutral]]
    "Ye Liang probably hates me to death, right?" [[1961 池小橙 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng had read this part of the story before. [[1962 旁白 neutral]]
    In the original story, even after Su Tao's face was scratched, she still attended the cruise party. Not only did she show off and gain recognition from Ye Liang's parents, but she also met a male lead who was a divine doctor that had been practicing in the mountains for 20 years. [[1963 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, this was an extremely Mary Sue female-oriented novel. The more male leads there were, the more love-hate drama there would be, and the more readers would like it. [[1964 旁白 neutral]]
    Without a doubt, the divine doctor male lead would also fall in love with Su Tao for some reason later, and use some ridiculous ability like the "Thirteen Needles of Taiyi" from urban novels to gradually heal the female lead. [[1965 旁白 neutral]]
    Even setting aside the later plot, this party was extremely important to Ye Liang, as it concerned his status and reputation in the capital. [[1966 旁白 neutral]]
    But now, she had completely ruined it all. [[1967 旁白 neutral]]
    "Adding the last party, I'm afraid we're really going to become enemies!" [[1968 池小橙 neutral]]
    [You were too impulsive, host. The male leads have plot armor. We villains can't fight them head-on!] [[1969 系统 angry]]
    "I was indeed a bit impulsive," Chi Xiaocheng nodded, looking back on it. [[1970 池小橙 neutral]]
    But when she thought of Su Tao breaking down and begging her on the rooftop, then bowing down in submission, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but get excited. [[1971 池小橙 happy]]
    "Although I was impulsive, it was totally worth it!" [[1972 池小橙 happy]]
    Besides, over two thousand Emotion Points were enough for her to do two ten-pulls! [[1973 池小橙 happy]]
    She had personally experienced how powerful the System's skills were. For her, the more of these things, the better. [[1974 池小橙 happy]]
    She wasn't in a rush to draw cards right now. What caught Chi Xiaocheng's attention was the girl lying by her bedside. [[1975 旁白 neutral]]
    Su Tao sat on a small stool with her hands folded, half of her pretty face resting on her arms, sleeping by Chi Xiaocheng's bedside like this. [[1976 旁白 neutral]]
    But that wasn't the main point. The main point was her overly flushed face and the fever patch on her forehead. [[1977 旁白 neutral]]
    She had a fever. [[1978 旁白 neutral]]
    [Ever since bringing you to the hospital, except for taking a shower and changing clothes, she hasn't left your side. Later, when she discovered she had a fever of 39 degrees, she quickly took some medicine and continued sitting here. She must be exhausted] [[1979 系统 neutral]]
    "Aren't you a villain system? Aren't you happy to see her suffering like this?" [[1980 池小橙 neutral]]
    [Host, you don't understand. The villain plotlines I want aren't this kind of plotline] [[1981 系统 neutral]]
    While bickering with the System, Chi Xiaocheng felt more relief and warmth in her heart. [[1982 旁白 neutral]]
    After bringing her to the hospital, Su Tao could have gone to rest, and it would have been good enough to rush over and show concern the moment she woke up. [[1983 旁白 neutral]]
    Before fainting, Chi Xiaocheng thought that level of care would already be very good. [[1984 旁白 neutral]]
    Who could have imagined that even with a high fever, Su Tao would still stay by her side? [[1985 旁白 neutral]]
    No wonder people say the female lead is everyone's beloved white moonlight. [[1986 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng struggled to reach out her hand and gently touched Su Tao's cheek. [[1987 旁白 neutral]]
    The temperature was a bit high, but her skin was incredibly smooth. The sensation was so lovely that she couldn't bear to let go. [[1988 旁白 neutral]]
    A few strands of black hair fell down, and with the light shining on them, she was already breathtakingly beautiful without any makeup. If she dressed up properly, how many people could resist her charm? [[1989 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng herself was also very pretty, but the word "cute" could already sum up her appearance quite well. [[1990 旁白 neutral]]
    But Su Tao was different. Even after that stunning first glance, she was the type who became more beautiful the more you looked at her. [[1991 旁白 neutral]]
    "System, do you think that one day I might be like those male leads, and after staying by Su Tao's side for a long time, I'll helplessly fall in love with her?" [[1992 池小橙 neutral]]
    [Doesn't the host like the female lead now?] [[1993 系统 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng didn't answer. [[1994 旁白 neutral]]
    Because she knew clearly in her heart that she didn't have that kind of romantic passion and love for Su Tao. [[1995 旁白 neutral]]
    If she truly liked her and loved her, she wouldn't have done something that "hurt" her like what just happened. [[1996 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, she wasn't really a yandere. [[1997 池小橙 neutral]]
    But apart from being influenced by the original owner's memories, she had only known this female lead for two or three days since crossing over. [[1998 旁白 neutral]]
    Lost in her thoughts, Chi Xiaocheng enjoyed touching Su Tao's smooth cheek. Perhaps she used a bit too much force, as the resting Su Tao slowly woke up. [[1999 旁白 neutral]]
    She reacted quickly, and when she came to her senses, she had already grabbed Chi Xiaocheng's small hand. "Xiaocheng, are you okay? How do you feel?" [[2000 苏桃 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng showed a genuinely satisfied smile, "I'm fine, thank you, Taotao." [[2001 池小橙 happy]]
    Su Tao let out a sigh of relief and got up to tuck the blanket around Chi Xiaocheng. [[2002 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps because she was also very weak, she stumbled and almost fell. [[2003 旁白 neutral]]
    After covering her forehead and taking a moment to recover, Su Tao helped Chi Xiaocheng arrange the messy blanket, and at the same time touched her forehead. "The fever hasn't gone down yet..." [[2004 苏桃 sad]]
    "I'm just a little tired, that's all. I'm fine," Chi Xiaocheng shook her head gently, her tea-colored hair swaying with the movement. "Being able to see Taotao staying by my side all along feels really good." [[2005 池小橙 happy]]
    Hearing this, Su Tao's eyes dodged a little when she looked at Chi Xiaocheng. [[2006 旁白 neutral]]
    All along. [[2007 旁白 neutral]]
    She caught the key point in Chi Xiaocheng's words. [[2008 旁白 neutral]]
    At the same time, she also heard that this sentence had a slightly meaningful tone. [[2009 旁白 neutral]]
    She still hadn't completely sorted out everything that happened on the rooftop. [[2010 旁白 neutral]]
    She hesitated for a moment, then avoided the topic by turning her gaze toward the door. "You... you should rest first. I'll go call the doctor." [[2011 苏桃 neutral]]
    "Mm~" [[2012 池小橙 happy]]
    Chi Xiaocheng nodded gently, making a cute humming sound. [[2013 旁白 neutral]]
    Her red eyes reflected Su Tao's frail figure as she left. [[2014 旁白 neutral]]
    Very obedient, and very happy. [[2015 池小橙 happy]]
