Chapter 222: The Secret Code: Never Love Tao [[19221 旁白 neutral]]
The wait was agonizingly long, but in hindsight, it also felt a bit fast. [[19222 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao waited all morning but received no reply from Dr. Cheng. [[19223 旁白 neutral]]
She even told her good friend, Cheng Cheng, about the situation, but it seemed Cheng Cheng was in a deep research session with her advisor and couldn't access her phone. [[19224 旁白 neutral]]
No one replied to her, and she couldn't go in to talk with Chi Xiaocheng due to her condition. [[19225 旁白 sad]]
It was winter break, approaching the New Year, and the class group chats were quiet. She had very few friends she could talk to about this. [[19226 旁白 sad]]
For a moment, Su Tao felt like she had been abandoned by the world. [[19227 旁白 sad]]
To understand yandere culture, she had once joined a few online fan groups, but the members either posted lewd images or discussed global politics. They rarely talked about anything related to yandere. [[19228 旁白 neutral]]
She remembered the last time she had tried to ask about Chi Xiaocheng's situation by saying, "I have a friend..." [[19229 旁白 neutral]]
But as soon as she raised the topic... [[19230 旁白 neutral]]
An admin posted a message—"Time for lewd pics!" [[19231 旁白 neutral]]
The chat was then flooded with lewd images and forwarded links, and no one paid any attention to her post. [[19232 旁白 sad]]
She realized the people who could truly help her were Dr. Cheng and Cheng Cheng. [[19233 旁白 neutral]]
One, an elder who never charged her much and always answered her questions thoughtfully. [[19234 旁白 neutral]]
The other, a close friend who wouldn't coddle her, spoke frankly, and would even scold her awake when she was feeling lost. [[19235 旁白 neutral]]
How many people like that do you meet in a lifetime? [[19236 旁白 sad]]
As Su Tao was lost in thought, Dongfang Yang walked in again and said, "Let's go get some lunch. Chi Xiaocheng's situation won't be resolved quickly. We have to wait for the doctors to examine her." [[19237 东方阳 neutral]]
"Yes, I know." [[19238 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao stood up. Seeing Dongfang Yang looking her up and down, she couldn't help but ask, "What's wrong?" [[19239 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's nothing." Dongfang Yang waved his hand and smiled. "I thought you'd be more down. Looks like I was worried for nothing." [[19240 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao forced a smile. "I can't say I'm in a good mood, but I've had all morning to think. At least Xiaocheng is awake, right? I can manage my emotions. I'm not like I was before!" [[19241 苏桃 neutral]]
She had been building up her resilience for months. With constant mental preparation, she could handle basic emotional regulation. [[19242 旁白 neutral]]
If she gave up on herself now, how would that be any different from before? [[19243 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng was awake, just with confused memories. It wasn't like before when she had actually died. [[19244 旁白 neutral]]
Repeating the same old path would be truly letting Xiaocheng down. [[19245 旁白 neutral]]
After lunch, they briefly discussed Chi Xiaocheng's situation. It wasn't until the afternoon that Si Chen arrived with Dr. Lin. [[19246 旁白 neutral]]
Along with Dr. Chen, the pair who had previously tested Chi Xiaocheng for her yandere traits were reunited. [[19247 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike last time, when Dr. Lin had more information and Dr. Chen was called in hastily without knowing Chi Xiaocheng's past. [[19248 旁白 neutral]]
This time, after the two doctors met, they reviewed and discussed all the past events of Chi Xiaocheng's case together. [[19249 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, the information was compiled by Dr. Lin, who worked for Si Chen. [[19250 旁白 neutral]]
And Si Chen was on Team Orange. [[19251 旁白 neutral]]
The information wasn't entirely truthful, and Dr. Lin, being a professional, could easily mislead Dr. Chen in certain aspects given the information gap. [[19252 旁白 neutral]]
Upon arriving at the hospital, Si Chen asked about Chi Xiaocheng's current condition. [[19253 旁白 neutral]]
"Memory confusion, emotional coldness, or emotional numbness..." Si Chen muttered to himself, his glasses flashing as they caught the light. [[19254 司辰 neutral]]
He asked Su Tao and Dongfang Yang seriously, "Have you confirmed this?" [[19255 司辰 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang said, "This is our guess based on our conversations with Chi Xiaocheng. We'll have to wait for Dr. Lin and Dr. Chen to see her to know the specifics." [[19256 东方阳 neutral]]
"That makes sense." Si Chen nodded and pushed up his glasses. "I'll go see Chi Xiaocheng too, to confirm her condition." [[19257 司辰 neutral]]
"Should we go with you?" [[19258 苏桃 neutral]]
"No, I can go by myself. Based on what you've said, I want to see how she perceives me. You don't need to come." [[19259 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen naturally stopped Su Tao and Dongfang Yang from following him. [[19260 旁白 neutral]]
There were no surveillance cameras in the hospital room. Chi Xiaocheng's condition was monitored through her medical devices and a nurse checking on her every half hour. [[19261 旁白 neutral]]
This was to prevent any hospital insiders from recording her situation and selling the information. [[19262 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang had even paid a large sum to hire a world-class hacker to protect the entire hospital's data, ensuring complete security. [[19263 旁白 neutral]]
He, Si Chen, knew Chi Xiaocheng's true situation and that her death was faked. He said he was asking about her, but what he really wanted was to confirm her next move. [[19264 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, Si Chen arrived at the door of the hospital room. After a nurse finished changing Chi Xiaocheng's IV, he knocked on the doorframe and walked in. [[19265 旁白 neutral]]
He closed the door behind him, creating a brief private space for the two of them. [[19266 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng turn to look at him with a faint smile, Si Chen frowned, feeling a slight sense of unease. [[19267 旁白 neutral]]
He calmly took off his coat and sat on a chair about a meter away from her. "I'm glad to see you're awake. How are you doing?" [[19268 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded. "Thank you for your concern, Young Master Si Chen. I feel pretty good. The doctor said I'll be able to walk in a few days after some rest." [[19269 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing this, Si Chen's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. [[19270 旁白 neutral]]
He had spoken with a double meaning, his question having two layers. [[19271 旁白 neutral]]
—After faking your death and coming back, what's the status of the plan against Su Tao? [[19272 旁白 neutral]]
—How is your physical condition? [[19273 旁白 neutral]]
The Chi Xiaocheng from before faking her death would have likely understood the meaning behind his words. [[19274 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps this was just an act. [[19275 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen decided to probe further, asking about various things related to him. [[19276 旁白 neutral]]
But to his surprise, Chi Xiaocheng's replies were completely off-topic. [[19277 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since his face was almost slashed in that alley, he, Si Chen, had gradually joined Team Orange, not only knowing about her yandere nature but also having the "startup password." [[19278 旁白 neutral]]
He had plotted with her many times on how to handle Su Tao. [[19279 旁白 neutral]]
But in Chi Xiaocheng's answers, this part of her memory had no mention of anything yandere-related. [[19280 旁白 neutral]]
The whole history had been rearranged into him, Si Chen, asking her about Su Tao's situation out of jealousy over Su Tao's relationship with Ye Liang. [[19281 旁白 neutral]]
To put it more simply, in Chi Xiaocheng's current memory, he, Si Chen, had become Su Tao's devoted admirer. [[19282 旁白 neutral]]
This was the most impossible scenario! [[19283 旁白 angry]]
I have "Team Orange" practically tattooed on my back, and you're telling me I'm a simp for Su Tao? [[19284 旁白 angry]]
Even at the beginning, his feelings for Su Tao were just that of a special, charming friend. [[19285 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, Si Chen couldn't tell if Chi Xiaocheng was acting or if she truly had memory loss. [[19286 旁白 neutral]]
After all, her acting skills were truly superb. [[19287 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen was silent for a long time. After peeling an apple, he finally couldn't hold it in any longer. [[19288 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng, do you remember our promise?" [[19289 司辰 neutral]]
He glanced back at the closed door and began to secretly test their code. "Never love Tao?" [[19290 司辰 neutral]]
