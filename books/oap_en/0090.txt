Chapter 90: I'll Never Love Tao, Do You Believe Me? [[7854 旁白 neutral]]
Outside Chi Xiaocheng's apartment complex, Chen Kun, wearing his Meituan uniform, was in a great mood. [[7855 旁白 happy]]
Yesterday, he and his buddies had arranged to go to KTV with some junior girls from their dorm. The weather forecast had predicted heavy snow for this afternoon and evening. [[7856 旁白 neutral]]
He thought their gathering with the junior girls would be ruined. [[7857 旁白 sad]]
Unexpectedly, not only did it not snow in the afternoon, but the sun even came out. It wasn't as cold tonight as usual. [[7858 旁白 happy]]
"After this last delivery, I'll take the money and go on a date with the girls!" [[7859 陈坤 happy]]
Chen Kun hummed a little tune and looked at his phone: "Unit 4, 502, Miss Chi." [[7860 陈坤 neutral]]
Looking at this name, Chen Kun stood in front of the elevator, lost in thought. [[7861 旁白 neutral]]
The surname Chi was rare. Among the many famous freshmen at the university, there was one with the surname Chi. [[7862 旁白 neutral]]
In the past, her makeup was like a drag queen's, and she pursued several young masters at the same time. While not exactly famous, she had become a laughingstock among many of the freshmen. [[7863 旁白 neutral]]
However, recently, Chi Xiaocheng's reputation at school had taken a sharp turn. [[7864 旁白 neutral]]
Students who had met her on the street all said that Chi Xiaocheng without makeup was devastatingly cute! [[7865 旁白 happy]]
Petite and adorable, and even a little timid. In terms of looks alone, she was on par with the top campus beauty, Su Tao. [[7866 旁白 neutral]]
There was also a rumor that the famous young master Dongfang Yang was originally disgusted by Chi Xiaocheng's makeup. [[7867 旁白 neutral]]
Well, it turned out she took it off! [[7868 旁白 neutral]]
Now he was completely smitten with her. [[7869 旁白 neutral]]
That young master had seen all kinds of women, so his approval made the name "Chi Xiaocheng" circulate among the male students for a while. [[7870 旁白 neutral]]
Many people went to stake out Chi Xiaocheng's classroom, hoping to catch a glimpse of her true appearance. [[7871 旁白 neutral]]
But what they didn't expect was that Chi Xiaocheng rarely attended class; skipping class was already her norm. [[7872 旁白 neutral]]
But Chen Kun was different. [[7873 旁白 neutral]]
He had been lucky enough to meet Chi Xiaocheng half a month ago, and at that time, he had even acted as a champion of justice! [[7874 旁白 happy]]
Unfortunately, he didn't get to see Chi Xiaocheng's face at that time, and he couldn't find her afterward. [[7875 旁白 sad]]
When Chi Xiaocheng's reputation improved, he had bragged about this in his dorm several times. [[7876 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Kun took out his phone and looked at the order again. [[7877 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Chi, I hope it's really her~" [[7878 陈坤 happy]]
He stepped into the elevator and went up to the fourth floor. [[7879 旁白 neutral]]
He soon arrived at Chi Xiaocheng's door. Just as he was about to ring the doorbell, he suddenly heard a bloodcurdling scream from inside. [[7880 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Kun's outstretched hand paused. [[7881 旁白 neutral]]
"That doesn't sound right, does it?" [[7882 陈坤 neutral]]
He looked down, and his eyes widened. He sucked in a sharp breath. [[7883 旁白 neutral]]
"Hiss, what are these red drops on the ground?" [[7884 陈坤 neutral]]
Chen Kun's heart pounded with nervousness, and he let out a soft breath. "Really, this apartment complex is so proper, how could anything happen? The owner must be an art lover, these red drops are just paint, right?" [[7885 陈坤 neutral]]
"Arghhhhh!" [[7886 陌生男1 sad]]
Another sound came from the house, so loud that even the closed door couldn't block it. [[7887 旁白 neutral]]
"Haha, watching a horror movie with the volume up so loud. Young people these days." [[7888 陈坤 neutral]]
Chen Kun reached out and rang the doorbell. In his nervousness, he didn't even notice that the door wasn't completely closed. [[7889 旁白 neutral]]
He rang the doorbell and pushed the door open. [[7890 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello, your..." [[7891 陈坤 neutral]]
The word "delivery" never left his mouth. Chen Kun was stunned. [[7892 旁白 neutral]]
The scene before him made his scalp tingle. [[7893 旁白 neutral]]
He saw two little girls, about 150 cm tall. One was holding a burlap sack, and the other, with long brown hair tied back, was bending over and pulling a knife out of a man lying on the floor. [[7894 旁白 neutral]]
The floor was smeared with bright red, and the hands and face of the brown-haired girl were splattered with crimson droplets. [[7895 旁白 neutral]]
And apparently, because of the sound of his doorbell. [[7896 旁白 neutral]]
Both little girls stopped what they were doing, as if frozen in time. Only their heads turned to look straight at him. [[7897 旁白 neutral]]
One of them had strange, terrifying vertical pupils that seemed to glow red. [[7898 旁白 neutral]]
The other, holding the sack, was expressionless, as if the bloody scene before her was a common sight. [[7899 旁白 neutral]]
The atmosphere, no matter how you looked at it, was just wrong! [[7900 旁白 neutral]]
They were both such cute little girls, why did they look so creepy! [[7901 旁白 neutral]]
The three of them just stared at each other, and the world seemed to stand still for a moment. [[7902 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, the brown-haired little girl stood up straight, holding the kitchen knife that was constantly dripping with red droplets. [[7903 旁白 neutral]]
She stared at Chen Kun and asked, word by word, "Do you like Taotao too?" [[7904 池小橙 angry]]
Chen Kun's legs went weak, and he fell to his knees. [[7905 旁白 neutral]]
He raised his hands high in surrender, and the takeout fell to the ground. "Miss, let's talk this out. I'm just a delivery guy." [[7906 陈坤 sad]]
Looking at Chen Kun's face, Chi Xiaocheng suddenly remembered that when she first transmigrated, this boy had helped her block one of Ye Liang's lackeys. [[7907 旁白 neutral]]
So she reached out and pushed aside two strands of hair that had stuck to her lips. Because of her touch, a smear of crimson now adorned the corner of her mouth. [[7908 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she gave him a bewitching smile. "I remember you, the big brother who helped me last time. You're a senior, right? Senior, why don't you come in and sit for a while~" [[7909 池小橙 happy]]
The person in front of him was undoubtedly Chi Xiaocheng. [[7910 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Kun was happy to see her. [[7911 旁白 happy]]
But that "senior" was just too damn scary! [[7912 旁白 sad]]
He had no choice but to bite the bullet and walk in. [[7913 旁白 neutral]]
Then Chi Xiaocheng handed him the kitchen knife. "Here, hold this for me." [[7914 池小橙 neutral]]
"Oh, okay." [[7915 陈坤 neutral]]
Chen Kun took the blood-soaked kitchen knife and just stood there dumbly, watching as Chi Xiaocheng and Fang Ning struggled to stuff the man in the raincoat into the burlap sack. [[7916 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't help but swallow hard. "Is he... dead?" [[7917 陈坤 sad]]
"Of course not." Chi Xiaocheng said lightly, "We don't do anything illegal. I just knocked him out." [[7918 池小橙 neutral]]
"???" [[7919 陈坤 neutral]]
With this pool of blood on the floor, was he really just "knocked out"? [[7920 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't dare to say it, and he didn't dare to ask. [[7921 旁白 neutral]]
However, at that moment, two police officers in uniform suddenly burst in through the door. [[7922 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as they entered, they saw Chen Kun standing to the side, pointing a kitchen knife at Chi Xiaocheng and Fang Ning. [[7923 旁白 neutral]]
One of the officers' pupils contracted, and he pulled out something black and pointed it at Chen Kun. "You there with the knife, don't move! Drop the knife!" [[7924 陌生男1 angry]]
Chen Kun was dumbfounded. [[7925 旁白 neutral]]
His legs went weak again, and he knelt down. [[7926 旁白 neutral]]
He raised his hands in surrender. "Officer, it's a misunderstanding!" [[7927 陈坤 sad]]
Besides the two police officers, a doctor also followed them in. They directly stated that they were called by Si Chen. [[7928 旁白 neutral]]
After some questioning, the case was determined. [[7929 旁白 neutral]]
The man in the raincoat had committed burglary, and the two little girls had acted in self-defense. [[7930 旁白 neutral]]
The delivery man, Chen Kun, had acted heroically to subdue the criminal, and in the process, had also killed a chicken to liven things up. [[7931 旁白 neutral]]
After everything was taken care of, the doctor stayed behind. [[7932 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at Chi Xiaocheng and said as she shook her hand, "Hello Miss Chi, I am the psychologist appointed by the young master. I am here to discuss your treatment in three days." [[7933 陌生女1 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the psychologist with a low gaze, not forgetting what Si Chen had said about still liking Su Tao. [[7934 旁白 neutral]]
In front of the psychologist, she dialed Si Chen's number. [[7935 旁白 neutral]]
"Is everything resolved?" [[7936 司辰 neutral]]
From the other end of the line came Si Chen's calm voice. [[7937 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled and said in a cute voice, "Si Chen, why did you only send a doctor over? I want to see you. Why don't you come over?" [[7938 池小橙 happy]]
This was the first time Si Chen had heard such a cute and clingy tone from her. [[7939 旁白 neutral]]
In the middle of the night, a little girl actively invites an adult man to her home. What could happen? [[7940 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen lit a cigarette and said melancholically, "If I say I'll never love Tao, would you believe me?" [[7941 司辰 sad]]
