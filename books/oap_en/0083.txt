Chapter 83: A Tribute to the Stress-Resistant Lao Tao [[7224 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hated drinking. [[7225 旁白 neutral]]
The dizziness prevented her from thinking rationally. [[7226 旁白 neutral]]
She also disliked the burning and spicy sensation. [[7227 旁白 neutral]]
But she still poured herself another glass. Su Tao closed her eyes, tilted her head back, and practically pinched her nose to force herself to drink it. [[7228 旁白 neutral]]
Still spicy, incredibly unpleasant. [[7229 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike Coke or Sprite, some people can't handle the sour and choking sensation of sparkling water at first, but they get used to it after drinking it more. [[7230 旁白 neutral]]
But alcohol is something that the vast majority of people can never get used to, no matter how much they drink. [[7231 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao found it hard to imagine that she would choose to drink. [[7232 旁白 neutral]]
However, it was precisely after taking a sip of alcohol, when she was no longer so clear-headed and rational, that she could think about things she normally wouldn't. [[7233 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao leaned against the washstand, resting for a long while. [[7234 旁白 neutral]]
Panting heavily. [[7235 旁白 neutral]]
The white wine was too strong; she was already struggling after just two sips. [[7236 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to use her drunken state to figure out what it was she detested. [[7237 旁白 neutral]]
Was it Chi Xiaocheng's suffocating and heavy love? [[7238 旁白 neutral]]
Did she hate it, like it, or was she running away from it? [[7239 旁白 neutral]]
After rinsing her mouth, Su Tao put away the remaining white wine and picked up her phone to check the time. [[7240 旁白 neutral]]
22:48. [[7241 旁白 neutral]]
"At this time, has Xiaocheng already fallen asleep?" [[7242 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao thought for a moment and sent a message to Chi Xiaocheng, "Xiaocheng, are you asleep?" [[7243 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng replied in a second, "Not yet, Taotao, what's up?" [[7244 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao: "How is your recovery? Sorry, I had some things to deal with at school today and have been busy. Do you need me to come to the hospital?" [[7245 苏桃 neutral]]
She had clearly slept at home all day, she really couldn't lie. [[7246 旁白 neutral]]
In the hospital, Chi Xiaocheng leaned against the bed, a helpless smile on her face. [[7247 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, she was incredibly eager to see Su Tao. [[7248 旁白 neutral]]
But a girl who is too straightforward is not cute. [[7249 旁白 neutral]]
So Chi Xiaocheng replied, "It's okay, Taotao, I can manage on my own. You must be tired after a long day, don't worry about me. Although it's a bit lonely and boring by myself, I can't let my things affect you, Taotao." [[7250 池小橙 neutral]]
Seeing this message, Su Tao felt much more at ease. [[7251 旁白 neutral]]
Undoubtedly, Xiaocheng had broken out of her yandere state and returned to normal. [[7252 旁白 neutral]]
A little clingy, but very sensible and caring, and wouldn't cause her too much trouble. [[7253 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to that extreme love, Su Tao definitely preferred the normal Xiaocheng. [[7254 旁白 neutral]]
"I should still go to the hospital, just to keep her company and stabilize her emotions." [[7255 苏桃 neutral]]
After sending a message to Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao got up and went into her room to put on a down jacket. [[7256 旁白 neutral]]
She returned to the living room and picked up her ladies' watch from the table. [[7257 旁白 neutral]]
Glancing at the sachet next to the watch, Su Tao couldn't help but be stunned for a moment. [[7258 旁白 neutral]]
"Isn't the sachet on my body?" [[7259 苏桃 neutral]]
Sleeping in Chi Xiaocheng's room, she had clearly smelled the faint fragrance of the sachet before and after she slept. [[7260 旁白 neutral]]
Familiar and pleasant. [[7261 旁白 neutral]]
"The stress must be getting to me, I'm starting to hallucinate." [[7262 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao shook her head, tied the sachet to her waist, and went out. [[7263 旁白 neutral]]
And in the hospital, Chi Xiaocheng leaned against the hospital bed, waiting quietly, and couldn't help but sigh to herself, "What a surprise, Taotao actually chose to use alcohol to numb herself." [[7264 池小橙 neutral]]
It was obvious that she hated drinking. [[7265 旁白 neutral]]
But she thought that being drunk would help her better understand her own feelings. [[7266 旁白 neutral]]
But if you get really drunk, you can't think clearly and it's hard to understand what you're doing. You'll just forget everything that happened when you were drunk after you wake up. [[7267 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, you probably don't need to keep pressuring Su Tao anymore, right?] [[7268 系统 neutral]]
"She's so tired, of course she needs to rest for a while. I wonder how Dongfang Yang and my brother are doing. If Ye Liang doesn't cause trouble, there's no need to put so much pressure on her for a short time." [[7269 池小橙 neutral]]
[Just not that much?] [[7270 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said, "There has to be some, otherwise how can I keep her thinking about me? If she doesn't take the initiative to de-stress, my next plan can't be executed." [[7271 池小橙 neutral]]
The system was silent for a moment upon hearing this. [[7272 旁白 neutral]]
[A tribute to the legendary stress-resistant Lao Tao] [[7273 系统 neutral]]
It's a good thing the original author of the novel made Su Tao's character so perfect. If it were anyone else being pushed like this step by step, they would have gone crazy long ago. [[7274 旁白 neutral]]
As a great villain system, even He couldn't help but feel sorry for Su Tao. [[7275 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way, how many emotion points do I have now?" [[7276 池小橙 neutral]]
[After deducting the 1000 emotion points the host spent on buying the original novel, there are currently 2435 emotion points left] [[7277 系统 neutral]]
[Among them, the male lead Ye Liang contributed the most emotion points to the host, followed by the female lead Su Tao, and then the supporting characters Chi Song and Dongfang Yang] [[7278 系统 neutral]]
Ye Liang already wanted to kill her, so of course he would contribute a lot of emotion points. [[7279 旁白 neutral]]
As one of the male leads, even without a halo, with his background and power, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't really eliminate him. [[7280 旁白 neutral]]
The young master of the Ye family in the capital, and the president of one of the leading enterprises in Jiuzhou City, if a person of such status were to fall, the retaliation from the forces behind him would definitely be stronger than Ye Liang's own retaliation. [[7281 旁白 neutral]]
In the world of this female-oriented novel, the connections of these family chaebols are spread all over the Great Zhou Nation, and the law may not even be able to sanction them. [[7282 旁白 neutral]]
Once the fish dies and the net breaks, before the return of her war god father, she and Su Tao would only be lambs to the slaughter. [[7283 旁白 neutral]]
A faint sense of unease still lingered in Chi Xiaocheng's heart. [[7284 旁白 neutral]]
"System, give me a ten-pull." [[7285 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng needed a skill that was stronger than blackening and that she could actively control. [[7286 旁白 neutral]]
It would be great if she could draw a Son of Fortune's halo to bless herself. [[7287 旁白 neutral]]
[Ten-pull in progress, congratulations to the host for obtaining the following items] [[7288 系统 neutral]]
Nine white and one gold. [[7289 旁白 neutral]]
This ten-pull didn't have the usual good luck, it hit the pity. [[7290 旁白 neutral]]
[Obtained Otaku Happy Water*3 (Drinking it can reduce 10 pounds of useless fat, the first choice for weight loss)] [[7291 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained Snow White's Poisoned Apple*1 (A bad luck poisoned apple cursed by the evil queen, eating it will bring a lifetime of bad luck)] [[7292 系统 neutral]]
[Obtained Su Tao and Xiaocheng dual figure*1 (A dual figure full of otaku atmosphere, a top-quality handicraft, staring at the figure for a long time will lead to a trance, and it is easy to have lucid dreams when sleeping)] [[7293 系统 neutral]]
[Chengzi Brand Sanitary Set*4 (A full set of female personal hygiene products, the first choice for menstruation)] [[7294 系统 neutral]]
[Congratulations to the host for obtaining the skill: Disguise (Intermediate)] [[7295 系统 neutral]]
[Disguise (Intermediate): The host can disguise herself as another person, and her appearance, height, bones, etc. can be freely changed, but she cannot violate the basic settings of the human body. It is limited to females, can be used once a week, and the disguise lasts for 3 hours] [[7296 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's focus was naturally on the skill first, it wasn't the attack-type skill she was hoping for. [[7297 旁白 neutral]]
But the operability of this skill is very high! [[7298 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, it's limited to females, otherwise Chi Xiaocheng's Dr. Cheng persona could be brought to the forefront to further "treat" Su Tao. [[7299 旁白 neutral]]
Besides that, there was the poisoned apple and the figure. [[7300 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng really wanted to take them out and have a look, but the doctor was coming soon. If the doctor thought she wanted to eat the apple and helped her peel it, it would be a huge misunderstanding. [[7301 旁白 neutral]]
So she suppressed her curiosity and quietly waited for Su Tao to arrive. [[7302 旁白 neutral]]
11:20. [[7303 旁白 neutral]]
The half-open door was finally knocked on gently. [[7304 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the pretty girl walk in with short boots, Chi Xiaocheng raised a cute smile, "Taotao, good evening~" [[7305 池小橙 happy]]
