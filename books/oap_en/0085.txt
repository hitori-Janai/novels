Chapter 85: Tasting Her Yandere Side (Extra chapter for Kongtian Longqing) [[7403 旁白 neutral]]
Early the next morning, Su Tao woke up early and began her daily routine. [[7404 旁白 neutral]]
After tiptoeing so as not to wake her roommates and finishing her ablutions, she changed into sportswear and went out. [[7405 旁白 neutral]]
Yesterday the sun was out, it didn't snow, and the weather wasn't that cold, so she resumed her usual exercise. [[7406 旁白 neutral]]
While keeping her body from rusting, she also maintained a good figure. [[7407 旁白 neutral]]
After breakfast, she went to the hospital to chat with Chi Xiaocheng for an hour, then returned to school. [[7408 旁白 neutral]]
Classes, studying, occasionally being asked by classmates to help with trivial matters, or being summoned by the counselor like a workhorse. [[7409 旁白 neutral]]
After lunch, she went to a snack supermarket near the school to work a shift until evening, when her time would free up a bit. [[7410 旁白 neutral]]
After visiting Chi Xiaocheng in the hospital again, Su Tao returned to her dorm, studying for her driving test while thinking about what Dr. Cheng had said. [[7411 旁白 neutral]]
Find like-minded friends, chat, and expand hobbies. [[7412 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, she first looked at Chen Qian and her roommate. [[7413 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian was looking in the mirror, humming a song happily. [[7414 旁白 neutral]]
As far as Su Tao knew, ever since her routine became regular and the blackheads and acne on her face and nose decreased, she had become more and more vain, constantly looking in the mirror and taking selfies. [[7415 旁白 neutral]]
Another roommate was sleeping in bed, snoring, but still playing a web drama out loud. [[7416 旁白 neutral]]
There were only three people in the four-person dorm, and one had rented a room outside because of her boyfriend and rarely came back. [[7417 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hesitated for a moment, but decided not to drag the two of them into this. [[7418 旁白 neutral]]
If Xiaocheng had an episode, they would be in danger. [[7419 旁白 neutral]]
Opening WeChat, Su Tao was wondering whether to casually add some online friends when she suddenly found someone had added her. [[7420 旁白 neutral]]
WeChat ID: Chengcheng. [[7421 旁白 neutral]]
Avatar: An unknown anime girl with green hair, making a peace sign, winking, and greeting cutely with her head tilted. [[7422 旁白 neutral]]
Below it was a line of emoticons: Ciallo～(∠・ω＜)⌒☆ [[7423 旁白 neutral]]
Source: People nearby. [[7424 旁白 neutral]]
Friend request message: Hello, WeChat pushes a nearby person to me every day, and today it's you. Meeting is fate, how about adding each other as friends? [[7425 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao clicked on Chengcheng's Moments. [[7426 旁白 neutral]]
Landscape photos, anime convention return photos, complaints about anime, occasionally saying things like "hungry, need food," almost two posts a day. [[7427 旁白 neutral]]
"She seems like a very cheerful girl, and her location is Jiuzhou Art Media Academy?" [[7428 苏桃 neutral]]
It was only 20 kilometers away from her Jiuzhou University. [[7429 旁白 neutral]]
And she was also an otaku. [[7430 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng also seemed to like anime? [[7431 旁白 neutral]]
It fit what Dr. Cheng said about online friends. [[7432 旁白 neutral]]
So Su Tao clicked to add her as a friend and took the initiative to say, "Hello, I'm Taozi." [[7433 苏桃 neutral]]
As soon as the message was sent, the other party replied immediately. [[7434 旁白 neutral]]
And her tone was very surprised. [[7435 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Oh my goodness, I actually added a friend!" [[7436 程程 happy]]
Chengcheng: "I add a nearby person every day, whoever WeChat pushes to me, I push to them, but 99% of them think I'm looking for a hookup. I finally added a real friend!" [[7437 程程 happy]]
Chengcheng: "Miss Taozi, or Brother Taozi? Thank you for adding me!" [[7438 程程 happy]]
Su Tao looked at the continuous paragraphs of text and emojis, and couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed. [[7439 旁白 neutral]]
This girl was too enthusiastic. [[7440 旁白 neutral]]
Taozi: "I'm a girl, Miss Chengcheng, why do you add a friend every day?" [[7441 苏桃 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Do you believe in fate?" [[7442 程程 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Before, I went to a master to get a fortune stick, and I asked him, where can I find a soulmate?" [[7443 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao raised an eyebrow, "What did the master say?" [[7444 苏桃 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "The master said that the soulmate is right in front of you, and you just need to pay 3000 yuan for the fortune stick." [[7445 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao: "..." [[7446 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Then he told me that instead of believing in such mysterious things, it's better to add a few nearby people on WeChat, maybe you'll find one. I've been adding for a week, and so far, you're the only one who has accepted my friend request, it's so sad!" [[7447 程程 sad]]
Taozi: "I'm also looking for a friend, please take care of me." [[7448 苏桃 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Then can I chat with you as much as I want later?" [[7449 程程 happy]]
Su Tao smiled lightly and typed back, "No problem." [[7450 苏桃 happy]]
So this was the stress-relieving chat Dr. Cheng mentioned. [[7451 旁白 neutral]]
Just a few words, text on a phone screen, and the other party's enthusiasm infected Su Tao. [[7452 旁白 neutral]]
It was also nice to confide in a stranger. [[7453 旁白 neutral]]
After all, no one knew anyone, and if it felt inappropriate, she could just delete the friend. [[7454 旁白 neutral]]
No responsibility, no impact. [[7455 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao still underestimated the other party's enthusiasm. [[7456 旁白 neutral]]
This person with the ID Chengcheng had a personality almost identical to Chi Xiaocheng's when she was little, like a small sun, her cheerfulness could be felt between the lines. [[7457 旁白 neutral]]
They chatted for two hours. [[7458 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was already in bed when the other party belatedly sent an apology. [[7459 旁白 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Sorry, I'm usually a chatterbox, I might have said a bit too much, I'm really sorry for disturbing you!" [[7460 程程 neutral]]
Taozi: "It's nothing, I had a great time chatting too." [[7461 苏桃 happy]]
Chengcheng: "But I've been talking about my own things, Taozi, you should talk about yours too, or if there's anything I can help you with." [[7462 程程 neutral]]
Her reminder made Su Tao immediately realize. [[7463 旁白 neutral]]
There really was a problem that needed someone else's opinion. [[7464 旁白 neutral]]
So Su Tao asked, "I have a friend who is quite extreme, she often hurts herself to please me, but I don't like this behavior, and I can't talk to her about it directly. What do you think I should do?" [[7465 苏桃 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Hmm, that's simple, isn't it? You just need to make your friend's uncontrollable behavior controllable." [[7466 程程 neutral]]
Taozi: "Controllable?" [[7467 苏桃 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Yes, you don't need to say anything at all. When she has such actions or tendencies, just show extreme annoyance, and then express what you want." [[7468 程程 neutral]]
Chengcheng: "Since your friend wants to please you, she will naturally change according to your thoughts." [[7469 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at these two sentences and thought to herself for a while. [[7470 旁白 neutral]]
This trick wouldn't work on Xiaocheng. [[7471 旁白 neutral]]
Just like on the rooftop last time. [[7472 旁白 neutral]]
She said she didn't want the gift Chi Xiaocheng gave her, but the more she said that, the more Chi Xiaocheng would become yandere. [[7473 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't listen no matter what she said. [[7474 旁白 neutral]]
But Chengcheng's words gave Su Tao a new idea. [[7475 旁白 neutral]]
To make Xiaocheng's uncontrollable behavior controllable, she could actually use words to guide her! [[7476 旁白 neutral]]
Although it might not make Xiaocheng completely normal. [[7477 旁白 neutral]]
But it could limit her to the greatest extent! [[7478 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes gradually lit up, as if she had found a direction for treating Chi Xiaocheng. [[7479 旁白 neutral]]
She replied to Chengcheng, "Thank you for your suggestion, I'll try it tomorrow!" [[7480 苏桃 happy]]
They said goodnight to each other, and with the sachet's blessing, Su Tao slept soundly. [[7481 旁白 neutral]]
Early the next morning, she arrived at Chi Xiaocheng's hospital. [[7482 旁白 neutral]]
"Good morning~" [[7483 池小橙 happy]]
Facing Chi Xiaocheng's soft and cute greeting, Su Tao's heart couldn't help but beat faster. [[7484 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao strangely, "What's wrong, Taotao? Your expression is a bit strange." [[7485 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao composed herself, sat down next to Chi Xiaocheng, and tentatively asked, "Um, Xiaocheng, if I said I liked something about you, would you be happy?" [[7486 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes!" Chi Xiaocheng squinted and smiled, "Of course I'd be happy if Taotao liked me." [[7487 池小橙 happy]]
"Then what if I said I hated something about you?" [[7488 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought for a moment, "Then I'd have to find a way to make Taotao like it, after all, Taotao can't hate me~" [[7489 池小橙 neutral]]
Her smile was still cute and sweet, but her eyes subtly emitted a hint of danger. [[7490 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, she was a yandere. [[7491 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't change, but would force herself to like it. [[7492 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Dr. Cheng said, learning to accept what she hated was an important step in treating her. [[7493 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao swallowed, gathered her courage, and looked at Chi Xiaocheng. [[7494 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly spoke. [[7495 旁白 neutral]]
"Then, Xiaocheng, do you want to play a game with me?" [[7496 苏桃 neutral]]
