Chapter 196: The Fifth Male Lead [[17176 旁白 neutral]]
Although Chi Xiaocheng couldn't stick her head out to see what was happening, [[17177 池小橙 neutral]]
she could guess a few things from their conversation. [[17178 池小橙 neutral]]
At the villa's main entrance, a distinguished young man in a white suit was being flattered by a crowd of guests, and it seemed like everyone wanted to be his friend. [[17179 旁白 neutral]]
The young man accepted all the attention, but he didn't notice that another young man beside him looked quite pale. [[17180 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had already learned about the early plot of this miracle doctor male lead from the original novel. [[17181 池小橙 neutral]]
In the original story, Chu Lingfeng met Su Tao after the original Xiaocheng scratched her face, which led to an unexpected encounter with this miracle doctor. [[17182 池小橙 neutral]]
Maybe it was due to the female lead's halo or some other reason, but the miracle doctor fell in love with Su Tao at first sight, not minding her scarred face at all while becoming her friend. [[17183 池小橙 neutral]]
He gradually showed his medical skills and spent over half a year slowly healing Su Tao's face. [[17184 池小橙 neutral]]
Until the appearance of the wealthy female character later on, this miracle doctor was completely devoted to Su Tao. [[17185 池小橙 neutral]]
Especially during the time he was treating Su Tao, the original author even gave Chu Lingfeng his own story arc. [[17186 池小橙 neutral]]
In the middle part of the original story, his presence was much stronger than Dongfang Yang's and Si Chen's. [[17187 池小橙 neutral]]
And he was also liked by many readers. [[17188 池小橙 neutral]]
He sounds like a pretty good male lead, right? [[17189 池小橙 neutral]]
But the reader's perspective is different from the author's. [[17190 池小橙 neutral]]
Sometimes, a reader's sudden idea is something the author never expected. [[17191 池小橙 neutral]]
This is why people talk about "copying from the comments," because readers can be really brilliant. [[17192 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was a creator in her past life, so when she spent emotion points to read the original novel, she read it with a critical eye. [[17193 池小橙 neutral]]
Thinking deeply about the details of the original work, she found that the descriptions of the male leads were very clear. [[17194 池小橙 neutral]]
Ye Liang, the overbearing CEO. [[17195 池小橙 neutral]]
To put it nicely, he was strong, overbearing, and doting, but to put it badly, he was extremely self-centered and couldn't stand anything that didn't go his way. Under the author's pen, he was presented to readers in a mostly positive light. [[17196 池小橙 neutral]]
After the wealthy female character appeared, because she was as beautiful as Su Tao but her family was more valuable than Su Tao's powerful father, Ye Liang betrayed her without hesitation. [[17197 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang, the cheerful and sunny boy. [[17198 池小橙 neutral]]
In the original story, he was portrayed as a somewhat silly and comedic character who often ended up on the losing side. What readers complained about most was that he and the female lead, Su Tao, were clearly the closest pair, but the author always made him disappear for no reason to create drama. [[17199 池小橙 neutral]]
As a result, in the middle and later stages, Dongfang Yang, who had to leave Su Tao for family reasons, actually received praise and approval from most readers. [[17200 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen, the rational and cold type who prioritizes his own interests. [[17201 池小橙 neutral]]
His portrayal in the original story was simple and clear. Su Tao's powerful father could help him regain his inheritance in the Si family, so he went all-in on Su Tao. With the author's help, after some love-hate drama, he naturally regained his power. [[17202 池小橙 neutral]]
But later on, the Si family faced a disaster. Su Tao's powerful father was already dead, and the only solution was the new wealthy female character. [[17203 池小橙 neutral]]
Between his family and Su Tao, Si Chen chose his family. [[17204 池小橙 neutral]]
Xiao Ming, the powerful "Dragon King" who returned from a battlefield abroad. [[17205 池小橙 neutral]]
In the original story, he had a very roguish attitude, and his greatest strength was keeping his promises, but the author failed to develop this character well. [[17206 池小橙 neutral]]
After he met Su Tao, as the Dragon King, he needed to hold back for three years to unleash his true power. The author's intention was for him to build a good relationship with Su Tao for three years, so he could support her as a powerful figure later on. [[17207 池小橙 neutral]]
But before the three years were up, the wealthy female character appeared. [[17208 池小橙 neutral]]
He kept holding back, and he held back so much that he eventually disappeared from the novel. [[17209 池小橙 neutral]]
Among the five male leads, Chu Lingfeng was the last one, the miracle doctor. [[17210 池小橙 neutral]]
He was taught by some unknown master from a mountain, and at 24, he emerged from some deep forest. With his "Thirteen Taiyi Needles" technique, he cured Su Tao in over half a year and gained the attention of many powerful groups in Jiuzhou City. [[17211 池小橙 neutral]]
Many powerful people were afraid of death, and because of his medical skills, he entered the core circle in the capital city. He was a very important male lead in the original story. [[17212 池小橙 neutral]]
Unlike Dongfang Yang, who was different on the inside, he was a handsome and decent character in front of Su Tao. But the author often wrote plots where Su Tao and Chu Lingfeng would argue because of some other female character. [[17213 池小橙 neutral]]
The most classic and common example was when Chu Lingfeng cured a powerful person, and that person would give him houses and women as gifts. [[17214 池小橙 neutral]]
This man accepted everything and even set up a villa for these women to live in. [[17215 池小橙 neutral]]
His explanation to Su Tao and the readers was that these were gifts from powerful people that he couldn't refuse. [[17216 池小橙 neutral]]
His explanation for always having women around was that he needed some maids to maintain his image. [[17217 池小橙 neutral]]
His frequent weakness was explained as using too much "true energy" for his needle treatments. [[17218 池小橙 neutral]]
With the author's plot armor making everyone less intelligent, Su Tao, of course, believed him. [[17219 池小橙 neutral]]
If you dig deeper, you'll find that this male lead was extremely promiscuous, even more so than Ye Liang. [[17220 池小橙 neutral]]
The five male leads, one wealthy female character, and Su Tao as the only female lead, formed the main plot of the original novel. [[17221 池小橙 neutral]]
Countless minor characters like Chi Xiaocheng, Chi Song, the powerful father, Second Young Master Ye, and Si Family's Elder Brother were just there to be put in their place. [[17222 池小橙 neutral]]
But now, because of her influence, the original plotline was a complete mess, so Chi Xiaocheng had to pay full attention to this miracle doctor male lead. [[17223 池小橙 neutral]]
She secretly glanced at the System's shop. [[17224 池小橙 neutral]]
[Snow White's Poisoned Apple: Price 3000 Emotion Points] [[17225 系统 neutral]]
She only had 700 emotion points left now. If she had the chance, she would save up and treat this miracle doctor to an apple. [[17226 池小橙 neutral]]
Speaking of which, the emotion points provided by Su Tao and the others were getting fewer and fewer. [[17227 池小橙 neutral]]
This new character would probably provide a lot of emotion points. [[17228 池小橙 happy]]
While Chi Xiaocheng was lost in her thoughts, the group got out of the car in the parking lot. [[17229 旁白 neutral]]
Led by Dongfang Yang, the four well-dressed people instantly captured the attention of the passing guests. [[17230 旁白 neutral]]
"Who's that guy in the lead? How dare he dress like that for Elder Si's birthday banquet." [[17231 陌生人1 neutral]]
"He looks kind of silly." [[17232 陌生人2 neutral]]
"Shh! Are you tired of living? That's Dongfang Yang, the only son of the Dongfang family. Let alone Si Zhenliu, even the current head of the Si family has to show him some respect." [[17233 陌生人3 neutral]]
The surrounding praise was endless. In his red trench coat, he was indeed very flamboyant. [[17234 旁白 neutral]]
But because of this, he completely overshadowed Su Tao, so no one's attention was on her at first. [[17235 旁白 neutral]]
The group quickly approached the manor gate, and they didn't even need an invitation. The welcomers over there had already noticed them. [[17236 旁白 neutral]]
The unhappy young man next to Chu Lingfeng was the first to run over. [[17237 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow at this and said to Si Chen, "This miracle doctor has no sense. He's even stealing your brother's spotlight." [[17238 东方阳 neutral]]
Watching the young man run over, Si Chen curled his lip, "He better have some real skills to treat Chi Xiaocheng. Otherwise, once I take over the Si family in this city, the first thing I'll do is kick him out!" [[17239 司辰 angry]]
Clinging to Su Tao's waist, Chi Xiaocheng secretly glanced at Si Chen and strongly agreed with him. [[17240 池小橙 neutral]]
He must be kicked out! [[17241 池小橙 angry]]
However, just as she thought that, Chu Lingfeng in his white suit happened to look over. [[17242 旁白 neutral]]
His gaze first fell on Qian Qing in her formal dress. [[17243 旁白 neutral]]
Then his eyes moved past Qian Qing and landed on Su Tao, who was following behind. [[17244 旁白 neutral]]
He stared directly, making no effort to hide it. [[17245 旁白 neutral]]
And at that moment, Chi Xiaocheng also stared right back at this miracle doctor male lead. [[17246 池小橙 neutral]]
She decided to take back her earlier thought about kicking him out. [[17247 池小橙 neutral]]
Hanging from Su Tao's waist and swaying gently with her movements, Chi Xiaocheng's body froze, but in the twilight, her eyes shone with a strange and dangerous light. [[17248 池小橙 neutral]]
