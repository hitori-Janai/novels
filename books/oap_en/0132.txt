Chapter 132: Your Confession, I Will Accept [[11599 旁白 neutral]]
"Avoiding the problem won't solve anything. As a doctor, you must understand this. Often, when we face the families, we can't escape, no matter the situation." [[11600 苏教授 neutral]]
"I've read all of the little one's reports. Medication can only play a supporting role. The most important thing is her mental problem." [[11601 苏教授 neutral]]
"It's commonly known as a heartache." [[11602 苏教授 neutral]]
As Professor Su passed Chi Xiaocheng's hospital room with Doctor Wang, she glanced inside with pity, "Miss Su has been avoiding it, which will only bring pain to both of them." [[11603 旁白 neutral]]
"Whether she likes it or not, Miss Su has to face the feelings she's been avoiding. She was saved by luck this time, but what about the next?" [[11604 苏教授 neutral]]
"Or perhaps, will there even be a next time?" [[11605 苏教授 neutral]]
No one knew if Chi Xiaocheng would cooperate with the treatment. [[11606 旁白 neutral]]
As a doctor, Professor Su could treat illnesses, but she couldn't cure a broken heart. [[11607 旁白 neutral]]
People often say that running away is shameful, but very effective. [[11608 旁白 neutral]]
But in Chi Xiaocheng's current situation, could she really run away a second time after escaping the first? [[11609 旁白 neutral]]
She had to face the problem eventually. [[11610 旁白 neutral]]
The longer she waited, the worse the situation would get. [[11611 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, people have to push themselves. [[11612 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes, when external pressure doesn't work, you have to create your own. [[11613 旁白 neutral]]
In a way, Professor Su's thinking was similar to Chi Xiaocheng's. [[11614 旁白 neutral]]
She had been using various pressures to force Su Tao to focus on her. [[11615 旁白 neutral]]
She also tried to use her cuteness and obedience to make Su Tao slowly fall in love with her in daily life. [[11616 旁白 neutral]]
But as it turned out, her month-long plan had failed. [[11617 旁白 neutral]]
She acted so cute and obedient to win her over. [[11618 旁白 neutral]]
A marriage certificate and a fiancé, and just like that, she left her! [[11619 旁白 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng finally understood that Dark Xiaocheng was right. [[11620 旁白 neutral]]
The only way to make her truly love her was to make it impossible for her to leave! [[11621 旁白 neutral]]
Possess first, then love! [[11622 旁白 neutral]]
Time passed slowly, and two more days went by. [[11623 旁白 neutral]]
With her superhuman body, Su Tao recovered quickly. Under the doctor's care, she could even exercise, but she still had to take her medicine on time. [[11624 旁白 neutral]]
Thanks to her skill's bonus, Chi Xiaocheng's recovery was also going well, and she was able to speak after two days. [[11625 旁白 neutral]]
But she still wouldn't face Su Tao. When Su Tao sat by her side, she would turn her head and sleep on the other side. [[11626 旁白 neutral]]
She was acting just like a pouting girlfriend. [[11627 旁白 neutral]]
On a new morning, Su Tao woke up early as usual and sat by Chi Xiaocheng's bed with a washbasin and a toothbrush. [[11628 旁白 neutral]]
She took a headband, helped Chi Xiaocheng up, and let her lean against the soft pillow. [[11629 旁白 neutral]]
She pushed the hair back from her forehead and secured it with the headband. [[11630 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, close your eyes and let me wash your face." [[11631 苏桃 neutral]]
The towel was wet with warm water, but Chi Xiaocheng was not cooperating. [[11632 旁白 neutral]]
She snorted softly and turned her head away. [[11633 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao said helplessly, "Alright, Xiaocheng, I know I was wrong, okay? Don't be mad anymore." [[11634 苏桃 sad]]
"Hmph~" [[11635 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng snorted again, still not responding. [[11636 旁白 neutral]]
What comes too easily is not cherished. [[11637 旁白 neutral]]
Although the fake death plan failed, it didn't mean she couldn't use this failure to make Su Tao focus completely on her before she recovered. [[11638 旁白 neutral]]
After waking up, other than unconsciously calling out "Taotao," Chi Xiaocheng hadn't spoken to Su Tao at all. [[11639 旁白 neutral]]
This made the guilty girl feel very upset. [[11640 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, Xiaocheng would have smiled at me obediently. [[11641 苏桃 sad]]
It's the third day after our fight, and Xiaocheng still hasn't smiled at me. [[11642 苏桃 sad]]
This feels awful. [[11643 苏桃 sad]]
But despite feeling awful, Su Tao put aside everything else in her life to take care of Chi Xiaocheng. [[11644 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that she was being ignored, she helplessly reached out, pinched Chi Xiaocheng's chin with her thumb and forefinger, and turned her head with no effort. [[11645 旁白 neutral]]
Then she wiped her face with the towel. [[11646 旁白 neutral]]
"Time to brush your teeth, open your mouth~" [[11647 苏桃 neutral]]
It was like taking care of a small child. [[11648 旁白 neutral]]
The only thing that gave Su Tao some relief was that although Chi Xiaocheng gave her a cold shoulder, she would still cooperate when needed. [[11649 旁白 neutral]]
She opened her small mouth, revealing the sharp little canine teeth that were usually hidden, which was especially cute. [[11650 旁白 neutral]]
Brushing teeth, washing up, and the routine body wipe took a full half-hour to complete. [[11651 旁白 neutral]]
The only thing that made Su Tao blush was that when she was wiping her body, Chi Xiaocheng would always let out soft, ambiguous moans, her cute voice full of temptation. [[11652 旁白 neutral]]
It always made her think she was using too much force. [[11653 旁白 neutral]]
After finishing these chores, it was breakfast time at the hospital. [[11654 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao fed Chi Xiaocheng porridge bit by bit, "Is it too hot? Also, Xiaocheng, please say something to me. I really, really know I was wrong." [[11655 苏桃 sad]]
After a mouthful of hot porridge, Chi Xiaocheng pouted and finally stopped giving Su Tao the silent treatment, "What's there to talk about? You don't like me anyway. You should just go with your fiancé." [[11656 池小橙 angry]]
As long as she didn't speak, there was nothing Su Tao could do. [[11657 旁白 neutral]]
But now that she was talking, how could she not understand? [[11658 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng is jealous. [[11659 苏桃 happy]]
The moment she spoke, it was clear the jar of vinegar had been knocked over. [[11660 旁白 neutral]]
But for some reason, Su Tao felt a faint sweetness in her heart seeing Chi Xiaocheng's jealousy. [[11661 旁白 happy]]
Jealousy is good. It means Xiaocheng still cares about her and likes her. [[11662 苏桃 happy]]
It wasn't like what was written in the suicide note. [[11663 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly smiled and explained, "Xiaocheng, you know me. I've never hidden anything from you. The fiancé and the marriage certificate were forged by a bad person who said he had news about my father." [[11664 苏桃 neutral]]
"I actually... I was going after news of my father." [[11665 苏桃 neutral]]
She had never acknowledged such a marriage certificate, let alone wanted to be with this Xiao Ming she had never even met. [[11666 旁白 neutral]]
If the jade pendant hadn't matched, she would have ignored him completely. [[11667 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng already knew the details from Si Chen, so of course she didn't believe the story about it being forged, and said unhappily, "You're still lying to me." [[11668 池小橙 angry]]
"I'm not!" [[11669 苏桃 sad]]
"Even you liking me is a lie, how can you say you're not lying?" [[11670 池小橙 angry]]
"I..." Su Tao was at a loss for words. She knew she would face this question eventually. [[11671 旁白 neutral]]
If she didn't answer well, Xiaocheng might refuse treatment. [[11672 旁白 neutral]]
And just as Professor Su had said, after this time, there would be no next time. [[11673 旁白 neutral]]
Not because she did well and there was no need for a next time. [[11674 旁白 neutral]]
But because after losing Chi Xiaocheng, with the person gone, there would naturally be no next time. [[11675 旁白 sad]]
Shouldn't she have faced this sooner? [[11676 旁白 neutral]]
There was no escaping it anymore. [[11677 旁白 neutral]]
If I can't refuse, then I'll force myself to accept. [[11678 苏桃 neutral]]
What happens later is a matter for later. The most important thing now is Xiaocheng! [[11679 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up and said to Chi Xiaocheng very seriously, "Xiaocheng, it's true that I like you. The reason I didn't accept your confession before was because... Ye Liang might still target me, and also that Lin Fangya." [[11680 苏桃 neutral]]
"If I accepted you, I was afraid they would hurt you like they did that night!" [[11681 苏桃 sad]]
"I don't want you to get hurt again!" [[11682 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao reached out, took Chi Xiaocheng's hand, and said with deep emotion, "Xiaocheng, if you confess to me again, I will say, I do." [[11683 苏桃 happy]]
If we become a couple, so be it. [[11684 旁白 neutral]]
Taking that step was something she had to do. [[11685 旁白 neutral]]
Holding that small hand, Su Tao's heart inexplicably began to beat faster. [[11686 旁白 neutral]]
It's not like I really like her. [[11687 苏桃 neutral]]
It was just a half-hearted response out of necessity. [[11688 旁白 neutral]]
But why did she still feel nervous? [[11689 苏桃 neutral]]
