Chapter 179: She Was Wrong, and You Were Wrong Too [[15579 旁白 neutral]]
What can cause a person's personality to change so drastically? [[15580 旁白 neutral]]
A certain famous sunny boy, Dongfang, once said: "Maybe it's because they encountered something crushing and unacceptable, or they have a hidden mental illness, or maybe a second personality." [[15581 旁白 neutral]]
And the current Fang Ning was clearly the first kind. [[15582 旁白 neutral]]
At noon, after saying goodbye to Su Tao, she went straight to the hospital. After finding Chi Xiaocheng's room, she saw the girl lying quietly in bed, with the electrocardiogram showing a flat line. [[15583 旁白 sad]]
The last tiny bit of hope was completely gone. [[15584 旁白 sad]]
She stood by the bed for a long time, but she wasn't the only one in the room. [[15585 旁白 neutral]]
There was also a strange older guy she didn't know. [[15586 旁白 neutral]]
This strange guy was shirtless in the middle of winter, with "Never Love Tao" written on his back. Even if he doesn't like peaches, he didn't have to write it on his back. [[15587 旁白 neutral]]
But considering this strange guy also knew Chi Xiaocheng and had been here watching over the body even earlier than her. [[15588 旁白 neutral]]
Out of politeness, Fang Ning still greeted Si Chen. [[15589 方柠 neutral]]
Si Chen was originally just waiting to see when Chi Xiaocheng would wake up from her faked death. He hadn't expected that other friends of hers would find out about her "death." [[15590 旁白 neutral]]
After all, besides his group and Su Tao, they had kept the matter of Chi Xiaocheng's death completely secret. [[15591 旁白 neutral]]
Even the teachers at school didn't know, only that Chi Xiaocheng had taken a long leave of absence. [[15592 旁白 neutral]]
More importantly, when Si Chen met Fang Ning's empty eyes, he instantly understood what kind of girl she was. [[15593 旁白 neutral]]
A backup plan left behind by Chi Xiaocheng after her faked death. [[15594 旁白 neutral]]
This thought suddenly appeared in his mind. [[15595 旁白 neutral]]
After all, weren't such empty and desperate eyes just like a yandere's? [[15596 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen looked at Chi Xiaocheng on the hospital bed, then beckoned to Fang Ning. "Little one, do you want to know how Chi Xiaocheng died?" [[15597 司辰 neutral]]
"How... did Sister Xiaocheng die?" [[15598 方柠 sad]]
"Yes, she died for someone, but that someone didn't love her at all." [[15599 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen put on his shirt, glanced at Chi Xiaocheng's closed eyes, his gaze deep. [[15600 旁白 neutral]]
I don't know what you're thinking, Chi Xiaocheng, but... if Su Tao continues like this, maybe by the time you wake up from your faked death, she still won't truly love you or care about you. [[15601 旁白 neutral]]
This incident with Ye Liang has become a big deal. If the news could be secretly spread to her 'God of War' father, maybe he would come back from abroad. [[15602 旁白 neutral]]
I'm doing this for my plan, and also for your relationship with Su Tao. [[15603 旁白 neutral]]
I can't rest easy until you two get married! [[15604 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen took Fang Ning to a lounge in the hospital and started chatting with her. [[15605 旁白 neutral]]
Like a manipulator behind the scenes, he guided Fang Ning's thoughts. [[15606 旁白 neutral]]
Was Fang Ning stupid? [[15607 旁白 neutral]]
Of course not. After leaving the hospital, she went straight to Chi Xiaocheng's neighborhood. [[15608 旁白 neutral]]
She knew that the strange guy said all those things just to make her understand that Sister Xiaocheng died because of Su Tao, and that Su Tao didn't like Sister Xiaocheng. [[15609 旁白 neutral]]
She just couldn't accept that Chi Xiaocheng was dead, but that didn't mean she wouldn't think calmly about her death. [[15610 旁白 neutral]]
Because she had already mentally prepared for it long before. [[15611 旁白 neutral]]
Standing at the entrance of the residential complex, waiting for the person to return, Fang Ning's thoughts drifted back to those few warm nights. [[15612 旁白 neutral]]
She was brought back from the heavy snow to a place with warm water, comfortable air conditioning, a rare sense of care, and concern for her life. [[15613 旁白 neutral]]
"Ningning, for my sake, can you pretend to be a yandere?" [[15614 池小橙 neutral]]
At that time, she learned what a yandere was and heard Chi Xiaocheng say those words. [[15615 旁白 neutral]]
"Then what should I do?" [[15616 方柠 neutral]]
"First, become friends with Taotao. It's best if you can become someone she trusts. That way, if something happens to me one day and she's lost, you can snap her out of it. If she's about to break down, you can comfort her. But you're not allowed to become her pillar of support." [[15617 池小橙 neutral]]
"After all, she's the one I like the most. She should like me back." [[15618 池小橙 neutral]]
Fang Ning didn't understand. "But that's not really pretending to be a yandere, is it?" [[15619 方柠 neutral]]
"You don't get it yet. With an emotional foundation and a tragic turning point, that's what makes a yandere. You don't even know Taotao. If you start acting crazy the moment you see her, that's not being a yandere." [[15620 池小橙 neutral]]
"Being too abrupt will just make people think you're insane." [[15621 池小橙 neutral]]
"The foundation of becoming her good friend is all for the reversal later. Anyway, if you don't understand, I'll teach you in the future. For now, the first step is to become friends with Taotao." [[15622 池小橙 neutral]]
She remembered Chi Xiaocheng's words. After becoming the manager of Su Tao's dormitory building, she also wanted to quickly get in touch with Su Tao. [[15623 旁白 neutral]]
But at that time, she didn't know that the pressure Chi Xiaocheng was putting on Su Tao was at its peak, and Chi Xiaocheng herself was becoming more and more unstable. [[15624 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao rarely returned to the dorm, and they only saw each other a few times with no interaction. [[15625 旁白 neutral]]
Let alone becoming friends. [[15626 旁白 neutral]]
Until now. [[15627 旁白 neutral]]
She saw Su Tao stumbling back in the darkness. [[15628 旁白 neutral]]
Her once-empty eyes now held a trace of disgust. [[15629 旁白 angry]]
"I'm sorry, Sister Xiaocheng, I can't listen to you anymore. You loved Sister Su Tao so much, I should have been on your side, helping you. But I think... she doesn't deserve you!" [[15630 方柠 angry]]
Everything she wanted to know, Si Chen had already told her. [[15631 旁白 neutral]]
And Sister Xiaocheng, if you want to scold me, please wait until I come find you, then you can scold me. [[15632 旁白 sad]]
After all, you're already dead, so I don't have to do what you said anymore, right? [[15633 旁白 sad]]
"Miss Su Tao, could you please not come here? This isn't your home, and you don't deserve to live in Sister Xiaocheng's house." [[15634 方柠 angry]]
This wasn't her home, but it was a place full of her memories. [[15635 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao wanted to take another step forward but was pushed back hard by Fang Ning. "Miss Su Tao, you don't even like Sister Xiaocheng. You did nothing after she died, so how can you shamelessly live in her house?" [[15636 方柠 angry]]
Stumbling back a couple of steps, Su Tao quickly retorted, "I... I didn't do nothing, and I'm not shamelessly trying to live in her house." [[15637 苏桃 sad]]
As she spoke, her voice grew louder. "Xiaocheng is gone. Of course, I have to take care of the things in her house. Nothing should be changed. And I have to take care of Da Wang, I..." [[15638 苏桃 sad]]
"Isn't that just an excuse you're making for yourself?" [[15639 方柠 angry]]
Fang Ning took a step closer. She was much shorter than Su Tao, but looking up, she seemed more like the attacker. "I know everything. Sister Xiaocheng gave so much for you, even died for you. If you had regretted it after her death and tried to redeem her past, that would be one thing." [[15640 方柠 angry]]
"But you did nothing." [[15641 方柠 angry]]
"Don't take her love for granted!" [[15642 方柠 angry]]
It wasn't just Fang Ning; even Si Chen and Chen Qian were telling her this. [[15643 旁白 neutral]]
Today, she also learned about Sister Long and her mentor, and realized she had misunderstood Chi Xiaocheng. [[15644 旁白 sad]]
The various emotions in her heart were already overwhelming. [[15645 旁白 sad]]
Even though Fang Ning's relentless words were the same as what others had said, each sentence stabbed at her heart. [[15646 旁白 sad]]
Saying I don't care about Xiaocheng. [[15647 旁白 angry]]
Saying I did nothing. [[15648 旁白 angry]]
Saying I'm selfish, and everything is for myself! [[15649 旁白 angry]]
What do you people know! [[15650 旁白 angry]]
Can you please stop talking from an outsider's perspective! [[15651 旁白 angry]]
She cut herself in front of me, locked me in the house, and would turn dark and do bad things if I reacted in a way she didn't like. What do you want me to do! [[15652 旁白 angry]]
You all say I don't like Xiaocheng, that I don't deserve her, but what choice did I have? I was just scared of her bloody and terrifying yandere state! [[15653 旁白 sad]]
To accept her, I have to accept her yandere side and endure her sickness. [[15654 旁白 sad]]
If I don't accept her, she becomes a yandere, and I'm forced to endure her sickness. [[15655 旁白 sad]]
What could I do? [[15656 旁白 sad]]
Did I have a choice? [[15657 旁白 sad]]
I... I didn't try to cure Xiaocheng for myself. I just... I just wanted Xiaocheng to get better. [[15658 旁白 sad]]
And now you're saying I don't regret her passing? [[15659 旁白 angry]]
What a joke! [[15660 旁白 angry]]
Su Tao suddenly looked up, tears in her eyes, gritting her teeth, and yelled at Fang Ning, "Don't say it so lightly! After she left, I regretted it every single moment, regretting that the one who died wasn't me!" [[15661 苏桃 angry]]
"But what's the use of saying that now?" [[15662 方柠 sad]]
Fang Ning tilted her head, her dark, empty eyes just looking at her. "What did you do after Sister Xiaocheng died?" [[15663 方柠 neutral]]
"I..." [[15664 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao stumbled back two steps and sat down on the snowy ground. [[15665 旁白 sad]]
She had done nothing. [[15666 旁白 sad]]
She talked about revenge, but it was actually Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, and even Brother Chi Song who were making the effort. She had only found Ye Liang's location because of the note. [[15667 旁白 sad]]
Everyone has a different perspective and sees different information. [[15668 旁白 neutral]]
In Fang Ning's eyes, Chi Xiaocheng died because of Su Tao. [[15669 旁白 neutral]]
And her greatest wish before she died was for Su Tao to love her. [[15670 旁白 sad]]
But in the end, that wish never came true. [[15671 旁白 sad]]
So, don't you think you don't deserve her? [[15672 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning didn't continue, but Su Tao saw deep disappointment in her eyes. [[15673 旁白 sad]]
She didn't resent her, nor did she hate her. [[15674 旁白 neutral]]
Rather, she felt that Chi Xiaocheng's death was not worth it. [[15675 旁白 sad]]
After all, in the end, even now, her own feelings for Xiaocheng weren't that strong. [[15676 旁白 sad]]
Let alone love. [[15677 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao hunched over and turned away, completely dejected. [[15678 旁白 sad]]
If she really wanted to enter the complex, Fang Ning probably wouldn't have physically stopped her. [[15679 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[15680 旁白 neutral]]
She really had no face to go back. [[15681 旁白 sad]]
The snow was a bit heavy, and the wind was making her cold. [[15682 旁白 sad]]
How she wished... to hold that warm little body again. [[15683 旁白 sad]]
It wasn't exactly a fight; just that everyone had different perspectives and cared about different things. After Su Tao left, Fang Ning turned to look at Chi Xiaocheng's house. [[15684 旁白 neutral]]
After standing in the snow like that for ten minutes, she wiped away the tears that had fallen after Su Tao left. [[15685 旁白 sad]]
Finally, she bowed towards the house and walked away into the snow. [[15686 旁白 sad]]
Neither of them noticed that inside a small snowman piled up by the gate, a scarecrow was hiding, listening clearly to their conversation. [[15687 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, this is completely outside the plan.] [[15688 系统 neutral]]
The System's voice brought Chi Xiaocheng slowly back to her senses. [[15689 旁白 neutral]]
She emerged from the snowman, watching Su Tao's retreating back in silence for a long time. [[15690 旁白 neutral]]
"System, do you think I did something wrong?" [[15691 池小橙 sad]]
[...] [[15692 系统 neutral]]
How am I supposed to comment on that? [[15693 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pressed her lips together. "I just wanted Taotao to love me back. She's still like this even after I've 'died'. I... I just feel so disappointed and hurt." [[15694 池小橙 sad]]
Even now, the love-o-meter glasses showed that her affection level hadn't reached the passing mark of 60. [[15695 旁白 sad]]
It was 49 before, now it's 51. [[15696 旁白 sad]]
If Su Tao overthinks it one day, will she start to hate me? [[15697 旁白 sad]]
I already "died" for you, why can't you just like me a little more? [[15698 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng fell silent, murmuring softly, "I... I'm not blaming Taotao, I'm just... thinking about how to make her fall for me faster." [[15699 池小橙 sad]]
[Host, feelings like love can't be rushed.] [[15700 系统 neutral]]
[Your methods might have been a bit extreme.] [[15701 系统 neutral]]
"But she hasn't changed even after I 'died.' Even if I wake up a month later, won't we just be stuck in this cycle?" [[15702 池小橙 sad]]
She was anxious because she was already becoming a bit unstable, perhaps really a bit of a yandere. [[15703 旁白 neutral]]
That's why she was so desperate to change the current situation. [[15704 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted Su Tao to love her. [[15705 旁白 neutral]]
So she wouldn't be influenced by the male leads who would appear in the future, nor be influenced by the will of the world. [[15706 旁白 neutral]]
The system sighed. [[15707 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, love is a two-way street. You need to give Su Tao some time to figure out her own feelings. Right now, she's like a boiling pressure cooker.] [[15708 系统 neutral]]
[In fact, she was pretty much set off just now, she just didn't show it.] [[15709 系统 neutral]]
Anyone could see she needed to de-stress. [[15710 旁白 neutral]]
Otherwise, she would never be able to think about this relationship rationally. [[15711 旁白 neutral]]
She would just keep constricting her thoughts under this high pressure, then subconsciously make excuses for herself and engage in self-preservation. [[15712 旁白 neutral]]
She isn't a rational person like Si Chen who would do anything to achieve his goals. Like many people, she's soft-hearted, easily swayed, and hesitant when facing problems. [[15713 旁白 neutral]]
You can't expect every normal person to be absolutely perfect. [[15714 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, you both have things you need to change.] [[15715 系统 neutral]]
"I'm already trying." [[15716 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng shook the snow off her body. "I'm trying my best to become normal." [[15717 池小橙 sad]]
Normal, as in when not using intermediate-level acting skills. [[15718 旁白 neutral]]
Because I thought, then Taotao would accept me, right? [[15719 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng browsed the system store, then picked something she had wanted to buy for a long time. [[15720 旁白 neutral]]
[Dream-Summoning Red Thread: Can bind to a person and create a dream, pulling the target in. The target will clearly feel that it is a lucid dream.] [[15721 旁白 neutral]]
[Single-use item, can only be used once.] [[15722 旁白 neutral]]
[Price: 1500 Emotion Points.] [[15723 旁白 neutral]]
"System, let's buy this." [[15724 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, that's too expensive. It's getting harder and harder for you to get Emotion Points now.] [[15725 系统 neutral]]
The biggest provider of Emotion Points was undoubtedly Su Tao. [[15726 旁白 neutral]]
However, as Su Tao's stress resistance grew, she gradually became numb, and the Emotion Points provided by her stress and breakdowns had become very few. [[15727 旁白 neutral]]
For 1500 points, it would be better to try the lottery for a random skill. [[15728 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng just shook her head. "I really did put too much pressure on Taotao. I think... at least I can let her have a sweet dream." [[15729 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng clicked 'purchase.' [[15730 旁白 neutral]]
A hint of anticipation lifted the corners of her lips. "Besides, I want to see Taotao." [[15731 池小橙 happy]]
Even if it's only in a dream. [[15732 旁白 sad]]
The red thread was set, but Su Tao wouldn't fall asleep immediately. [[15733 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, she was walking aimlessly on the road, her coat on, letting the wind and snow hit her face. [[15734 旁白 sad]]
It was cold, and she felt awful. [[15735 旁白 sad]]
But this helped to clear her head, preventing her from escaping and forgetting what happened today, what others had said. [[15736 旁白 neutral]]
With a lost look in her eyes, she unknowingly arrived at the riverbank. The cold weather had already frozen most of the river's surface. [[15737 旁白 neutral]]
A small part, a mixture of ice and water, shimmered under the streetlights. [[15738 旁白 neutral]]
She gazed at the city on the opposite bank but didn't notice that a figure had appeared beside her at some point. [[15739 旁白 neutral]]
"It's rare to see someone here so late." [[15740 陌生人1 neutral]]
The figure beside her chuckled softly, as if having found a kindred spirit, and leaned on the cold iron railing, asking with a sigh, "Miss, are you thinking of jumping into the river too?" [[15741 陌生人1 neutral]]
