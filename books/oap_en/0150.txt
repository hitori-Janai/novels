Chapter 150: The Death of Chi Xiaocheng [[13227 旁白 neutral]]
"Again! And again! And again!" [[13228 苏桃 angry]]
"Why do you always have to force me!" [[13229 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao screamed this with all her might, her hair messy and tears welling up in her eyes. [[13230 旁白 neutral]]
She clenched her teeth, her shoulders trembling with either anger or fear. [[13231 旁白 neutral]]
The uncomprehending questions hammered at Chi Xiaocheng's heart, "Hey Xiaocheng, can you tell me?" [[13232 苏桃 sad]]
"Why would you think I'd like your pain?" [[13233 苏桃 sad]]
"Why do you always force me to experience your sickness? Don't you understand the pain of not being able to breathe!" [[13234 苏桃 angry]]
"Is this what you call loving me!" [[13235 苏桃 angry]]
"Don't you know that I'm scared, that I hate it!" [[13236 苏桃 angry]]
"It makes me tremble with fear. Why on earth did I convince myself again and again to accept your sickness!" [[13237 苏桃 angry]]
Self-harm? [[13238 苏桃 angry]]
And then saying you love me? [[13239 苏桃 angry]]
A love that makes it impossible to leave? [[13240 苏桃 angry]]
What a joke! [[13241 苏桃 angry]]
I'm a person. [[13242 苏桃 angry]]
A normal person! [[13243 苏桃 angry]]
How could I possibly like something so heavy that uses life as an excuse! [[13244 苏桃 angry]]
You always say this is a unique kind of love. [[13245 苏桃 sad]]
But why can't it be gentle, slow, and likable? [[13246 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao had countless nightmares about such scenes that would jolt her awake. [[13247 旁白 neutral]]
How could anyone like such a heavy love, such a suffocating feeling! [[13248 旁白 neutral]]
And you talk about forcing love? [[13249 苏桃 angry]]
Hahahahaha... [[13250 苏桃 angry]]
Si Chen, this is just impossible! [[13251 苏桃 sad]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng looking down without responding, Su Tao took a step forward and yelled even louder, "Tell me, why!" [[13252 苏桃 angry]]
After pouring out the words she had held back for so long, Su Tao felt an incredible sense of relief. [[13253 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't want to care about what happened next, nor did she want to think about Chi Xiaocheng's reaction. [[13254 旁白 neutral]]
This was a fight! [[13255 旁白 neutral]]
She just wanted to tell Chi Xiaocheng that she didn't want to cater to her yandere nature anymore! [[13256 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps hearing Su Tao's inner thoughts, or having already guessed that Su Tao would refuse, Chi Xiaocheng kept her head down and didn't fall further into darkness. [[13257 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, in a desolate voice, she asked, "But besides hurting myself, what other reason do I have to make Tao Tao stay with me?" [[13258 池小橙 sad]]
"Heh, make you stay by my side?" [[13259 苏桃 angry]]
An image from her first lucid dream flashed through Su Tao's mind. Did Chi Xiaocheng's so-called "staying by my side" mean getting rid of everyone? [[13260 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice grew frantic as she retorted, "Haven't I always been by your side? You talked about this 'little dark room' game, and I've been listening to you and playing along!" [[13261 苏桃 angry]]
"Does that not count as being by your side!" [[13262 苏桃 angry]]
"But what about you?" [[13263 苏桃 angry]]
"Why did you go see Sister Long from the snack shop and my advisor while I was sleeping!" [[13264 苏桃 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng explained, "I did it for your own good, they were all..." [[13265 池小橙 neutral]]
"Interfering with my life, that's also for my own good!" [[13266 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao shouted again, cutting Chi Xiaocheng off, "Your so-called 'for my own good' means sending them all to the hospital, their status unknown?" [[13267 苏桃 angry]]
"It's just them for now, but who's next? Chen Qian? Xiao Wei? Dongfang Yang? Or Si Chen?" [[13268 苏桃 angry]]
"Will you only be satisfied when everyone around me is gone!" [[13269 苏桃 angry]]
Isn't this the ending from the dream? [[13270 旁白 neutral]]
Is your sickness just an excuse for your so-called love? [[13271 旁白 neutral]]
"And you say you don't know how to keep me except by hurting yourself. Haven't I been by your side all this time!" [[13272 苏桃 angry]]
The lack of perspective and mutual understanding created this misunderstanding. [[13273 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's emotions were already unstable. Realizing yesterday that she was sick, she also noticed how exhausted Su Tao looked last night. [[13274 旁白 neutral]]
After waking up, she belatedly began to show concern for her. [[13275 旁白 neutral]]
But in reality, wasn't she also a powder keg ready to explode? [[13276 旁白 neutral]]
I can give everything for you, deal with those who bully you, so why won't you look at me properly, why are you still running away! [[13277 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lifted her head, her crimson vertical pupils suddenly staring at Su Tao, "You say you're by my side, but when have you ever been by my side!" [[13278 池小橙 angry]]
"Tao Tao, do you really think I don't know?" [[13279 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked toward Su Tao step by step. [[13280 旁白 neutral]]
Startled by the cat-like pupils, Su Tao gradually regained some rationality. A trace of fear rose in her heart as she subconsciously retreated towards the balcony. [[13281 旁白 neutral]]
"What... what nonsense are you talking about now?" [[13282 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's voice trembled. [[13283 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice was grim, "Nonsense?" [[13284 池小橙 angry]]
"Why don't you mention the fact that you've been pretending to like me all this time?" [[13285 池小橙 angry]]
"I confessed to you, and you avoided it to go find your fiancé. Was that fake?" [[13286 池小橙 angry]]
"You said in the hospital that if I confessed, you would definitely accept. Then why didn't you confess to me then!" [[13287 池小橙 angry]]
"You said you wanted me to be obedient. I became obedient, so where were you!" [[13288 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng continued to press forward, "Putting on a show of liking me, spending a little bit of time each day to eat with me, thinking that's taking care of me, thinking that's keeping me company?" [[13289 池小橙 angry]]
"Aren't you just enjoying my obedience and warmth while avoiding my love for you!" [[13290 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao was cornered by the balcony door, her back pressed against the thin, ice-cold glass. [[13291 旁白 neutral]]
The sudden impact on the back of her head finally brought Su Tao back to her senses. [[13292 旁白 neutral]]
She had gone too far, and the one who completely snapped was Chi Xiaocheng instead. [[13293 旁白 neutral]]
But the frustration and fear in her heart still made her deny that Chi Xiaocheng was right. [[13294 旁白 neutral]]
Not knowing how to argue, she could only retort loudly, "I didn't!" [[13295 苏桃 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng slammed her hand on the glass door behind Su Tao, "Then why did you ignore me for months after our argument during summer break, and even kept defending Ye Liang!" [[13296 池小橙 angry]]
The glass door made a loud "thud," leaving Su Tao completely stunned. [[13297 旁白 neutral]]
It was a fatal blow, with no way to counter it. [[13298 旁白 neutral]]
Countless people had given her their analysis. [[13299 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng, Si Chen, and Doctor Chen from Dongfang Yang's side had all told her. [[13300 旁白 neutral]]
The main reason Chi Xiaocheng became a yandere was because of her, Su Tao. [[13301 旁白 neutral]]
And she, out of fear, had been avoiding taking responsibility. [[13302 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like she had brought it all upon herself. [[13303 旁白 neutral]]
Before Su Tao could even explain, Chi Xiaocheng's tears fell, her pupils gradually clearing, "Tao Tao, you know, even so, I never blamed you!" [[13304 池小橙 sad]]
"You say you don't like my sickness, but if I don't hurt myself, if I don't do such extreme things, how would you ever pay attention to me?" [[13305 池小橙 sad]]
"I want your affection, your gaze, your embrace, your concern... I want your love!" [[13306 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng clutched her heart, tears streaming down her face. [[13307 旁白 neutral]]
The crimson vertical pupils returned to normal in that instant. [[13308 旁白 neutral]]
There was no trace of the yandere anymore; what she said was the truest voice from the bottom of her heart. [[13309 旁白 neutral]]
It was also her most vulnerable side. [[13310 旁白 neutral]]
I want everything from you, even just a little bit is fine. [[13311 旁白 neutral]]
From the building across, a ray of light, perhaps a reflection from the sun, shone on Su Tao. [[13312 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if it wanted to clear the fog surrounding her. [[13313 旁白 neutral]]
And at that moment, alarm bells suddenly went off in Chi Xiaocheng's mind. [[13314 旁白 neutral]]
The sun had just risen. For the glass of the opposite building to reflect sunlight here, it would have to be at least ten in the morning. So where was this light coming from? [[13315 旁白 neutral]]
The sense from her alertness skill was stronger than ever, coming from the roof of the opposite building. [[13316 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was trembling as she started to reach out her hand. [[13317 旁白 neutral]]
Just then. [[13318 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang—!" [[13319 旁白 neutral]]
A deafening gunshot, accompanied by a faint flash of light, came from the opposite building. [[13320 旁白 neutral]]
How fast is a bullet? [[13321 旁白 neutral]]
A normal person, unless their sixth sense warned them to dodge instinctively, couldn't react at all. [[13322 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was the same. Her outstretched hand trembled, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't turn to look in the direction of the sound. [[13323 旁白 neutral]]
Fear overcame everything, and while her blood ran cold, her body was completely stiff. [[13324 旁白 neutral]]
The threat of death made her realize that this shot was aimed at her. [[13325 旁白 neutral]]
However, someone beside her moved faster than the bullet. [[13326 旁白 neutral]]
Without any hesitation, Chi Xiaocheng instinctively pounced on Su Tao. Boosted by her potential-unleashing skill, her movements were faster than the bullet! [[13327 旁白 neutral]]
She forcefully pushed Su Tao a step away, but the piercing sound of the bullet shattering the glass was already right beside them. [[13328 旁白 neutral]]
"Tss—!" [[13329 旁白 neutral]]
A sharp pain shot through Chi Xiaocheng's entire body from her nerves, and beside her ear was another terrified scream. [[13330 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng!" [[13331 苏桃 sad]]
