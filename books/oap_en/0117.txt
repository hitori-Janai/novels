Chapter 117: We're All Doing This for the Taotao We Love (Bonus chapter for Heti Tianfu) [[10321 旁白 neutral]]
Is that right? [[10322 苏桃 neutral]]
Not entirely. [[10323 苏桃 neutral]]
If it wasn't a romantic kind of love, Su Tao could have nodded countless times. [[10324 旁白 neutral]]
But she just couldn't get over the idea of being a couple, two girls together, so she kept avoiding it. [[10325 旁白 sad]]
"Hey, Xiaocheng, let me explain." [[10326 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao grabbed Chi Xiaocheng's hand, ignoring her resistance. "I..." [[10327 旁白 neutral]]
Before she could finish, a loud "boom" echoed from the sky. [[10328 旁白 neutral]]
A helicopter was approaching. [[10329 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, several police cars arrived, and an officer quickly interrupted them, "Are you two okay?" [[10330 警察 neutral]]
"It's dangerous here. Come with us. We'll keep you safe and get to the bottom of this!" [[10331 警察 neutral]]
After he spoke, two female officers approached. One stood by Su Tao, while the other looked at the tears in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes with sympathy. [[10332 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but reach out, her voice gentle, "Don't be scared, little sister. We'll protect you. Let's get in the car first." [[10333 女警 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at Su Tao with disappointment and pulled her hand away. [[10334 旁白 sad]]
She turned and took the female officer's hand. [[10335 旁白 neutral]]
The bouquet of white roses fell to the ground as Su Tao watched in shock. [[10336 旁白 sad]]
She reached out, wanting to say something, but then she saw Dongfang Yang "fly" down from the helicopter on a rope. [[10337 旁白 neutral]]
He landed smoothly and said anxiously, "Su Tao, are you okay?" [[10338 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao opened her mouth, but the only word she whispered was "Xiaocheng." [[10339 旁白 sad]]
Dongfang Yang watched Chi Xiaocheng leave, a weight finally lifting from his heart. "Chi Xiaocheng is okay too, thank goodness. Let's go, get in the police car. It might still be dangerous here. These people are insane, using guns in the city!" [[10340 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lip and nodded lightly. [[10341 旁白 sad]]
But her mood didn't improve at all. [[10342 旁白 sad]]
She glanced again at Chi Xiaocheng's small figure from behind, an indescribable regret filling her heart. [[10343 旁白 sad]]
It's just a label. [[10344 苏桃 neutral]]
Only the two of us would know. [[10345 苏桃 neutral]]
Would it have been better to just nod? [[10346 苏桃 neutral]]
But if they became a couple now, how could she ever cure Xiaocheng? The moment she mentioned breaking up, how would Xiaocheng react? [[10347 旁白 sad]]
A yandere's condition can never truly be cured. [[10348 旁白 neutral]]
Yet now, she felt a heart-pounding urge. [[10349 旁白 neutral]]
If she didn't hold onto Chi Xiaocheng now, she might regret it for a very long time. [[10350 旁白 sad]]
As she hesitated again, Chi Xiaocheng had already gotten into the car with the female officer. [[10351 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao bent down to pick up the white roses and asked, "Dongfang Yang, if Xiaocheng and I have a fight, should I be the one to apologize?" [[10352 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang gave Su Tao a strange look. "With Chi Xiaocheng's silly personality, if it's your fault, you have to apologize. If it's not, she'll come running back to you the next day." [[10353 东方阳 neutral]]
"Anyway, the most important thing is that you're both safe. I almost lost my helper for the cafe." [[10354 东方阳 happy]]
Su Tao pressed her lips together and got in the car. [[10355 旁白 sad]]
So this time, whose fault was it? [[10356 苏桃 sad]]
Back at the station, they gave their statements. Even after returning home, several plainclothes officers were watching over the neighborhood. [[10357 旁白 neutral]]
Jiuzhou City would not be peaceful tonight. [[10358 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng arrived home looking like she'd lost her soul, stumbling toward the sofa. [[10359 旁白 sad]]
Dark Xiaocheng didn't disappear, silently accompanying her the whole way. [[10360 旁白 neutral]]
Only after they sat down did she whisper in Chi Xiaocheng's ear, "See? I told you Su Tao wouldn't accept your confession. She's just avoiding your affection." [[10361 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"The love you're offering is something she doesn't want to accept." [[10362 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng bit her lip, showing no signs of her yandere side emerging. She just felt a sharp, twisting pain in her heart. [[10363 旁白 sad]]
Why wouldn't she say yes? [[10364 池小橙 sad]]
She kept saying she liked me. [[10365 池小橙 sad]]
It was all a lie! [[10366 池小橙 angry]]
Dark Xiaocheng sighed and patted Chi Xiaocheng's head. "Don't be too sad. Why not take my suggestion? Just possess her, like you did before. Lock her up at home, in a dark little room." [[10367 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"She's only pretending to like you now, but slowly, she'll become just like your ex-girlfriend. Do you really want to go through that pain again?" [[10368 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"No... she wouldn't." Chi Xiaocheng didn't argue with Dark Xiaocheng, nor was she as aggressive as she usually was. [[10369 池小橙 sad]]
Perhaps, deep down, she was starting to agree with the suggestion. [[10370 旁白 neutral]]
She just didn't dare to think that way. [[10371 旁白 sad]]
"Taotao wouldn't betray me. She's just... she's just not ready to accept a relationship between two girls. Yes, that must be it. Her mindset hasn't shifted yet; she's still bound by old ideas." [[10372 池小橙 sad]]
"Look at you, still making excuses for her even after she lied to you. How can such a weak and humble love ever make her care about you?" [[10373 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng wasn't trying to manipulate her, just stating the facts like a normal conversation partner. "She is the female lead of this world. If you don't tie her down and give her freedom, she will trigger countless plots from the original novel." [[10374 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"My dear Xiaocheng, you've had it too easy these past two weeks. So far, only Ye Liang is gone." [[10375 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"What about the other male leads in the story? You know about them, don't you?" [[10376 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"Dongfang Yang is still around, Si Chen is still alive, and that genius doctor male lead who was supposed to meet Su Tao by now hasn't even appeared. Could there be other surprises?" [[10377 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"Lin Fangya is the perfect example. You didn't hold onto Su Tao, so she appeared. The world is correcting us." [[10378 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at her and asked the first question she'd had in two weeks, "What are you? My inner demon?" [[10379 池小橙 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng smiled faintly. "However you want to see it. Another personality? Or just a simple hallucination?" [[10380 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"I am just a manifestation of another side of you. I have no physical form. I can't touch anyone but you." [[10381 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"But no matter what, we are the same person." [[10382 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng fell silent. [[10383 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since coming back from the psychologist, she knew that something about her wasn't quite right. [[10384 旁白 neutral]]
Is she my yandere side? [[10385 池小橙 neutral]]
But my yandere personality was just an act. [[10386 池小橙 neutral]]
She asked again, "So what you want, what you've been tempting me to do, is it all just to take over my mind as the main personality?" [[10387 池小橙 neutral]]
"No." Dark Xiaocheng gave a strange smile. "I'm doing it for the Taotao that we both love!" [[10388 漆黑小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng was silent again. [[10389 旁白 neutral]]
Does it matter what she is? [[10390 池小橙 neutral]]
Maybe she's just an inner demon, like at the beginning. [[10391 池小橙 neutral]]
But... to possess Taotao... [[10392 池小橙 neutral]]
The thought began to surge relentlessly in Chi Xiaocheng's mind. [[10393 旁白 neutral]]
The "yandere" and "normal" parts of her mind, once separate, were now gradually merging. [[10394 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, her phone rang. [[10395 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the caller ID. It was Si Chen, whose calls hadn't gone through before. [[10396 旁白 neutral]]
She answered the phone numbly, her voice devoid of emotion. "What is it?" [[10397 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen didn't notice her unusual tone and, for once, sounded anxious. "Chi Xiaocheng, something big has happened!" [[10398 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned. "What is it?" [[10399 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen took a deep breath. "This is very important. You must, must keep your emotions stable, okay?" [[10400 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng grew more confused. "Just say it." [[10401 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen swallowed hard. "There's news about Su Tao's father. A man with the surname Xiao brought it." [[10402 司辰 neutral]]
"We've checked the token. It really was left by Su Tao's family. But the crucial thing is..." [[10403 司辰 neutral]]
"That man, Xiao, also brought a marriage certificate. He says he's Su Tao's fiancé!" [[10404 司辰 neutral]]
As the words fell, Chi Xiaocheng felt something explode in her mind with a "boom." [[10405 旁白 angry]]
So, she never loved me. And I never had her. [[10406 池小橙 sad]]
