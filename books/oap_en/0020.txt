Chapter 20: I've become like this all because of you~ [[1752 池小橙 sad]]
It was supposed to be a beautiful moment of resolving misunderstandings, opening up to each other, and sharing warmth. [[1753 旁白 neutral]]
But that was shattered the moment she saw the gift-bearer's demonic eyes and chilling smile. [[1754 旁白 neutral]]
The scene from the basement instantly flashed through her mind. [[1755 旁白 neutral]]
Restrained, unable to move. [[1756 旁白 neutral]]
Her face was held firmly as words of madness and love were whispered into her ear. [[1757 旁白 neutral]]
The same strange methods. [[1758 旁白 neutral]]
The same wrong expressions of affection. [[1759 旁白 neutral]]
But in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes, such a gift was just ordinary love. [[1760 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao didn't understand. This was the twisted logic of a yandere: love could be expressed in any way. [[1761 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly threw the gift aside, her eyes filled with terror. [[1762 旁白 sad]]
Earlier tonight, she had wanted to jump from the building because of a single sentence. [[1763 旁白 neutral]]
And now she was talking about giving a gift. [[1764 旁白 neutral]]
As her breathing became difficult from the shock, Su Tao's mind was a complete mess. [[1765 旁白 sad]]
The cold raindrops stinging her skin kept her from losing her senses like she had in the basement. [[1766 旁白 neutral]]
A thread of reason remained in her mind, wondering why Chi Xiaocheng was doing this. [[1767 旁白 neutral]]
What could the gift be? [[1768 苏桃 neutral]]
The box is wrapped so beautifully? [[1769 苏桃 neutral]]
And the motive? [[1770 苏桃 neutral]]
Suddenly, Su Tao remembered something Chi Xiaocheng had said in the basement: "You can only like me, Taotao." [[1771 旁白 neutral]]
Could that be the reason? [[1772 苏桃 neutral]]
But this is too extreme! [[1773 苏桃 sad]]
Countless questions flashed through her mind, and then she smelled a fragrance other than mud and dust. [[1774 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't you like it?" [[1775 池小橙 neutral]]
A soft question whispered in her ear. [[1776 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stiffly turned her head, wet strands of hair covering half of her eyes, hiding a flicker of terror. [[1777 旁白 sad]]
A bolt of lightning flashed, once again illuminating the dark night. [[1778 旁白 neutral]]
It was just for an instant, but Su Tao still noticed Chi Xiaocheng's crimson eyes glowing red in the flash. [[1779 旁白 neutral]]
The soft voice ignored her fear and continued, "Taotao didn't like the mineral water today, so you don't like this either?" [[1780 池小橙 neutral]]
"Oh, I see now." [[1781 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng showed a look of sudden realization, her voice becoming twisted, "Could it be that Taotao prefers Ye Liang's gift?" [[1782 池小橙 sad]]
Ye Liang? [[1783 苏桃 neutral]]
Why bring up Ye Liang again? [[1784 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao's mind couldn't even process it before Chi Xiaocheng made her next move. [[1785 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, can you just say you like me?~" [[1786 池小橙 neutral]]
A warm breath tickled her nose, and another flash of lightning revealed Chi Xiaocheng leaning in close, her eyes deep and dark. [[1787 旁白 neutral]]
Like a predator staring at its prey, her crimson pupils flickered with a demonic light in the darkness. [[1788 旁白 neutral]]
Was it really as simple as saying she liked her? [[1789 苏桃 sad]]
Looking at that smiling expression, Su Tao's eyes filled with fear, the previous gentleness gone. [[1790 旁白 sad]]
Only now was she truly convinced that Chi Xiaocheng's behavior in the basement was no accident. [[1791 旁白 neutral]]
She was acting the same way again. [[1792 旁白 neutral]]
This version of Xiaocheng felt like a stranger to her. [[1793 旁白 sad]]
"Taotao, why are you looking at me like that? Didn't you say you wouldn't hate me?" [[1794 池小橙 sad]]
"If you don't hate me, doesn't that mean you like me?" [[1795 池小橙 sad]]
The soft voice gradually became resentful, making Su Tao's heart tighten again. [[1796 旁白 neutral]]
She had a gut feeling that if she couldn't calm Chi Xiaocheng down, she might really "go down" as she understood it. [[1797 旁白 sad]]
She swallowed hard and bit her tongue sharply. [[1798 旁白 neutral]]
She forced down the discomfort in her throat, using the pain to stay clear-headed. [[1799 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao forced a strained smile at Chi Xiaocheng, "Xiaocheng, I... of course I don't hate you, it's just..." [[1800 苏桃 sad]]
"I see......" [[1801 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng pulled her hand back again. [[1802 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly raised her head, staring intently into Su Tao's eyes in the darkness, "If you don't like me... does that mean Taotao likes Ye Liang?" [[1803 池小橙 sad]]
As she asked, her hands moved without hesitation. [[1804 旁白 neutral]]
She gently caressed Su Tao's cheek, her thumb rubbing against the skin, feeling like a needle prick that made Su Tao tremble. [[1805 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao quickly took out her phone and turned on the flashlight. [[1806 旁白 neutral]]
Her pupils contracted, and her hand trembled, dropping the phone to the ground. [[1807 旁白 sad]]
The flashlight lit Chi Xiaocheng's pretty face from below. [[1808 旁白 neutral]]
She wore a demonic, twisted smile, her eyes filled with what she thought was love! [[1809 旁白 neutral]]
Little did she know, in Su Tao's eyes, such love was terrifying, and those beautiful eyes seemed to glow red. [[1810 旁白 sad]]
Horror. [[1811 旁白 sad]]
Fear. [[1812 旁白 sad]]
Rapid breathing. [[1813 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's mind was once again in chaos. [[1814 旁白 sad]]
Just then, she met Chi Xiaocheng's bewitching crimson eyes again. [[1815 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't speak, but raised her hand again, holding a photo of her and Ye Liang together. [[1816 旁白 neutral]]
"I..." [[1817 苏桃 sad]]
Even though rainwater was trickling down her face and over her lips, Su Tao still felt her lips were dry. [[1818 旁白 neutral]]
Rip—the photo was torn to shreds, as if to tear her and Ye Liang apart. [[1819 旁白 angry]]
Su Tao had no time to think, she only knew that if she didn't stop her, this twisted side of her might get even worse! [[1820 旁白 sad]]
Biting her tongue hard again, Su Tao quickly grabbed Chi Xiaocheng's hand, her voice cracking, "Xiaocheng, please don't be like this, I've never hated you, and I never chose Ye Liang over you, please believe me!" [[1821 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng seemed not to hear her, showing a silly, satisfied smile. [[1822 旁白 neutral]]
She leaned her cheek closer. [[1823 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's breathing grew more rapid; this pretty face was so lovely, yet now it frightened her. [[1824 旁白 sad]]
Looking up, she met Chi Xiaocheng's expectant crimson eyes again. [[1825 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she was urging her to hurry. [[1826 旁白 neutral]]
Urging her to quickly show her affection. [[1827 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao clenched her jaw, shut her eyes tightly, her body trembling and stiff, but she gathered all her strength. [[1828 旁白 sad]]
... [[1829 旁白 neutral]]
She had to take the initiative to show her affection, to prove she was more important than Ye Liang. [[1830 旁白 neutral]]
With the rain, she could feel nothing but softness. [[1831 旁白 neutral]]
But the memory of Chi Xiaocheng's twisted eyes still terrified her. [[1832 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng watched with satisfaction, a hint of excitement on her face. [[1833 池小橙 happy]]
After tonight, Su Tao would never ignore her again, right? [[1834 池小橙 happy]]
She will definitely try to understand why I became like this, and during that time, she will protect me, even from those male leads. [[1835 池小橙 happy]]
Yes, that's it! [[1836 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng no longer looked sad and pitiful. [[1837 旁白 neutral]]
She lowered her head, bringing her nose to Su Tao's damp hair, enjoying the faint, fresh scent. [[1838 旁白 neutral]]
Her face was entranced, the corners of her lips turned up, like a hunter watching its prey walk into a trap. [[1839 旁白 neutral]]
I finally completed the third step. [[1840 池小橙 happy]]
I'm at my limit, both physically and mentally. [[1841 池小橙 sad]]
Perfect, I can faint in her arms. [[1842 池小橙 happy]]
Taotao, this time, I've become like this because of you again. [[1843 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng gradually relaxed, and a wave of sleepiness washed over her. [[1844 旁白 neutral]]
"Thump," she fell onto Su Tao. [[1845 旁白 neutral]]
Pinned by the small body, Su Tao belatedly lifted her head and frantically grabbed Chi Xiaocheng's shoulders, "Xiaocheng!" [[1846 苏桃 sad]]
BOOM— [[1847 旁白 neutral]]
The thunder roared again. [[1848 旁白 neutral]]
