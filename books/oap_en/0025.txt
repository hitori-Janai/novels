Chapter 25: Have you ever liked her? [[2158 旁白 neutral]]
    This was the first time Su Tao had heard this term. [[2159 旁白 neutral]]
    She hadn't been exposed to ACG culture, nor had she grown up in a stable environment like ordinary people. [[2160 旁白 neutral]]
    She had been an orphan since childhood, often having to struggle for survival. Before she found Chi Xiaocheng, she lived with an old grandmother who collected garbage. [[2161 旁白 neutral]]
    The old grandmother's son didn't care for her, and she had no grandchildren. Her legs weren't good, so living together with Su Tao was mutually helpful. Because of the grandmother's guidance, Su Tao became very sensible at a young age. [[2162 旁白 neutral]]
    But the old grandmother died early. After helping Su Tao through the most difficult period, she passed away. [[2163 旁白 sad]]
    Later, in elementary school, she met Chi Xiaocheng who was being bullied. [[2164 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng's family was also very poor, but they still accepted her. [[2165 旁白 neutral]]
    After that, besides working part-time jobs, she focused on studying hard. Her childhood happiness mostly came from Chi Xiaocheng. Every time she heard the cute little girl behind her calling her "sister," she felt it was all worth it. [[2166 旁白 happy]]
    Even now, her hobbies were still reading books and listening to music. [[2167 旁白 neutral]]
    She didn't watch dramas, read novels, or play games, let alone watch video streams. Her internet use was mostly for reading news. [[2168 旁白 neutral]]
    When Chi Xiaocheng mentioned the concept of "yandere," she immediately went online to search for it. [[2169 旁白 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng wasn't in a hurry during this time, slowly waiting for Su Tao's response. [[2170 旁白 neutral]]
    In the next hospital room, Su Tao stared at the search results in shock. [[2171 旁白 neutral]]
    "Based on how Xiaocheng has been acting, it really seems like what the doctor called 'yandere'?" [[2172 苏桃 neutral]]
    "This is actually considered a cute trait online!" [[2173 苏桃 neutral]]
    Su Tao was stunned. [[2174 旁白 neutral]]
    Whether it was the basement or the rooftop, she deeply felt the terror of Chi Xiaocheng's strange state. [[2175 旁白 neutral]]
    But from internet users' perspective, this was apparently a lovable trait in the 2D world. [[2176 旁白 neutral]]
    She looked at the explanation and read it word by word: "Abnormal twisted psychology caused by deformed love, with tendencies toward possessiveness and extreme thoughts or behaviors, leading to extreme words and actions beyond normal understanding..." [[2177 苏桃 neutral]]
    "Extreme words and actions refer to crazy love confessions, exclusiveness, stalking, destroying what they can't have, self-harm, and other extreme behaviors." [[2178 苏桃 neutral]]
    "Hiss!" [[2179 苏桃 neutral]]
    Su Tao thought carefully - wasn't this exactly like Xiaocheng? [[2180 旁白 neutral]]
    Love confessions, exclusiveness, self-harm - it was a perfect match! [[2181 旁白 neutral]]
    "How do these twisted internet users think this is cute? Does nobody have anyone who loves them?" [[2182 苏桃 neutral]]
    Then Su Tao searched whether yandere could be cured. [[2183 旁白 neutral]]
    Few doctors gave opinions on this topic, because yandere in reality also refers to a type of mental illness. [[2184 旁白 neutral]]
    This search was fine until she did it, then she got another shock. [[2185 旁白 neutral]]
    If extreme enough, yandere could turn dark, and many internet users' examples of yandere involved dismembering people and stuffing them in refrigerators, which made Su Tao's scalp tingle. [[2186 旁白 neutral]]
    After a while, Su Tao hopefully went to find this "Dr. Cheng." [[2187 旁白 neutral]]
    Peach: "Doctor, I just learned about what yandere means. I feel like my friend is quite serious. Do you have a solution?" [[2188 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "Of course, I've been practicing for thirty years. I've seen every kind of situation. Dealing with yandere is my specialty." [[2189 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "That's great! How much do you charge?" [[2190 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "No rush, we're still in the consultation phase. I'll give you some initial treatment suggestions based on your friend's situation. If you find them useful, we can discuss further. However, this type of treatment rarely involves medication." [[2191 池小橙 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "For this type of mental patient, you need to use actions and words to provide psychological treatment." [[2192 池小橙 neutral]]
    Hearing this, Su Tao felt much more at ease. [[2193 旁白 neutral]]
    Chen Qian really was her good best friend, treating her so well. [[2194 旁白 neutral]]
    The uncle she introduced was not only skilled but also responsible and serious. She had just been worried he might ask for too much money. [[2195 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, she really didn't have money, and if he asked for a lot, she would have to borrow it. [[2196 旁白 neutral]]
    With a serious expression on her face, Su Tao replied: "Then I'll trouble you, Dr. Cheng." [[2197 苏桃 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved up as she lightly snapped her fingers. [[2198 旁白 neutral]]
    Perfect! [[2199 池小橙 happy]]
    Now she could completely cooperate with the doctor's identity to create a better yandere plan, forcing Su Tao to take bolder actions in the name of "treating" her. [[2200 旁白 neutral]]
    The fake persona she had created for herself earlier was now coming in handy. [[2201 旁白 neutral]]
    She typed to Su Tao: "Miss Peach, yandere comes in many types. In my opinion, your friend should be the dependent type, but she has examples of kidnapping you, so she likely also has some possessive-type traits." [[2202 池小橙 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "But you said she's mostly normal, so she should be primarily dependent-type with less possessive-type behavior." [[2203 池小橙 neutral]]
    "The former develops deformed love for you and gradually becomes dependent on you. If you leave her or don't put her first in your heart, she'll develop various negative emotions, and in serious cases, she may have suicidal tendencies." [[2204 池小橙 neutral]]
    Su Tao recalled everything that happened on the rooftop last night and immediately agreed with what Chi Xiaocheng said. [[2205 旁白 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "The possessive type often shows twisted love and strong possessiveness. They want to make the person they like into their possession. Words are useless, so they mostly use imprisonment." [[2206 池小橙 neutral]]
    "The good news is that her possessive traits are limited. Her dependence on you won't cause social harm. As long as you treat her well and go along with her ideas, she won't be too excessive." [[2207 池小橙 neutral]]
    During their conversation, Chi Xiaocheng also sent Su Tao explanations of various yandere traits. [[2208 旁白 neutral]]
    Like the elimination type and aggressive type - constantly killing people would be too terrifying. [[2209 旁白 neutral]]
    Even so, it still gave Su Tao a headache. [[2210 旁白 neutral]]
    She hesitated for a moment, then asked Dr. Cheng about the problem that had been bothering her: "Doctor, according to what you're saying, Xiaocheng says she likes me, so for treatment..." [[2211 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "Do you like her?" [[2212 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "Uh... well, I told you we're both girls." [[2213 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "I also said that's not the point." [[2214 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "That IS the point!" [[2215 苏桃 neutral]]
    Peach: "You're a doctor so you might think it's nothing, but I'm the person involved. Two girls and all, this this this... this isn't right, is it?" [[2216 苏桃 neutral]]
    Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao's panic between the lines and smiled calmly: "She really doesn't understand at all. Cute girls are treasures of this world, so wouldn't two cute girls be double the happiness?" [[2217 旁白 neutral]]
    She continued typing in Dr. Cheng's tone: "Actually, you've fallen into a misunderstanding. You don't need to actually like her, you just need to go along with her feelings and pretend to care about her." [[2218 池小橙 neutral]]
    Su Tao's eyes lit up: "Right! Doctor, this is indeed a good method. First calm her emotions, then gradually help her work through her issues during treatment. Once she returns to normal, it'll be fine, right?" [[2219 苏桃 happy]]
    Dr. Cheng: "Yes, you grew up together and have a good relationship, right? If you can't accept her, then use this method - pretend to like her, but there's one thing you need to pay attention to." [[2220 池小橙 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "Yandere people are often very sensitive. If she finds out you're pretending to like her, if she has a mental breakdown, there could be serious consequences." [[2221 池小橙 neutral]]
    Peach: "This..." [[2222 苏桃 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "That's why I asked whether you actually like her or not. This point is very important. If you really don't like her at all, pretending might be quite difficult." [[2223 池小橙 neutral]]
    Dr. Cheng: "Have you really never liked her at all?" [[2224 池小橙 neutral]]
