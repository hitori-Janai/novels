Chapter 45 Blackening [[3850 旁白 neutral]]
The two walked one after another, slowly reaching the depths of the alley. [[3851 旁白 neutral]]
It was extremely messy here, with a musty smell emanating from everywhere. In the dim shadows, besides the occasional meow, only the sound of the wind remained. [[3852 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen stopped and turned around. [[3853 旁白 neutral]]
He habitually looked straight ahead, then his gaze dropped. [[3854 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng still wearing her hood and shrinking her shoulders cautiously, he said lightly, "Don't worry, as a descendant of the Si family, I wouldn't bring you to a place like this to lay hands on you. I just want to talk to you about something." [[3855 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's vigilance did not diminish. She took a step back. [[3856 旁白 neutral]]
Her body pressed against the wall, her right hand remaining in her hoodie pocket. [[3857 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen shrugged helplessly, "Seriously, you even confessed to me before, saying you liked me. Do you really need to be so afraid of me?" [[3858 司辰 neutral]]
He brought Chi Xiaocheng here not to tease her, but to verify something. [[3859 旁白 neutral]]
So he spoke frankly, "You like Su Tao, I'm not wrong about that, am I?" [[3860 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned, but still nodded, "So what?" [[3861 池小橙 neutral]]
In front of this person, the delicate pretense she used with Dongfang Yang was useless. [[3862 旁白 neutral]]
Every expression, every movement, would be seen through by him. [[3863 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could only use her "true nature" to face those snake-like eyes. [[3864 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen spread his hands and chuckled, "Nothing, I just have something to tell you." [[3865 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow. [[3866 旁白 neutral]]
Then her pupils suddenly became vertical. [[3867 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen, who had been smiling gently, suddenly bent down and leaned closer to her. His lips tightened, and his eyes, like knives, pierced directly into Chi Xiaocheng. [[3868 旁白 neutral]]
The setting sun was behind Si Chen. [[3869 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, his shadow completely enveloped Chi Xiaocheng. [[3870 旁白 neutral]]
Forcing her into darkness. [[3871 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, this male lead uttered a threatening low voice, "Chi Xiaocheng, I warn you, Su Tao is my woman!" [[3872 司辰 angry]]
"What did you say!!!" [[3873 池小橙 angry]]
Instantly, Chi Xiaocheng's eyes underwent an eerie transformation. A pair of vertical pupils, like those of a fierce stray cat, pierced directly into Si Chen. [[3874 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she was enveloped in darkness, these vertical pupils seemed to emit a defiant light. [[3875 旁白 neutral]]
One hand had already tightly gripped the small knife in her hoodie pocket. [[3876 旁白 neutral]]
Constantly exerting force. [[3877 旁白 neutral]]
A strange feeling arose in Si Chen's heart. For a moment, he actually felt fear. [[3878 旁白 neutral]]
The fear of a weak human being stared down by a fierce tiger! [[3879 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen then thought, he's 1.9 meters tall, and now he's startled by a 1.5-meter loli? [[3880 旁白 neutral]]
The shame and anger in his heart overshadowed his fear. He straightened up and said lightly, "I said, Su Tao is my woman." [[3881 司辰 neutral]]
As he spoke, he observed Chi Xiaocheng's state. [[3882 旁白 neutral]]
He found that this small figure just hung her head, making no movement. [[3883 旁白 neutral]]
He scoffed inwardly. [[3884 旁白 neutral]]
If she were a true yandere, she would have already attacked me by now. [[3885 旁白 neutral]]
Is she acting because of my identity? [[3886 旁白 neutral]]
It seems Su Tao's worries were unfounded. [[3887 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen decided to add more fuel to the fire and see her reaction. [[3888 旁白 neutral]]
So he took a step back, extended one hand, and starting from his pinky, he tightened his fingers one by one, forming a fist. [[3889 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if the world was in his grasp. [[3890 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, snowflakes fell from the sky, as if to cooperate with his actions. [[3891 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's tone was mocking and slow: "What, what's so surprising about this? Su Tao is such a perfect woman, everyone would like her, right? You wouldn't think Su Tao would like you, would you?" [[3892 司辰 neutral]]
"Don't be ridiculous. You're a girl, what advantage do you have to attract Su Tao?" [[3893 司辰 neutral]]
"Su Tao is already mine." His voice gradually deepened, putting pressure on her. [[3894 司辰 neutral]]
"Some time ago, you were recovering in the hospital, and Su Tao came to me to talk." [[3895 司辰 neutral]]
"When you were bullied, Su Tao came to me again to confide her troubles." [[3896 司辰 neutral]]
"Do you remember that time at the school gate? You should have seen me then. We were..." [[3897 司辰 neutral]]
"On a date~" [[3898 司辰 neutral]]
He slowly uttered the last few words in a malicious tone, curious about Chi Xiaocheng's reaction. [[3899 旁白 neutral]]
But he found that this small loli still hung her head, one hand in her pocket. [[3900 旁白 neutral]]
Her body trembled slightly, but she made no further movement. [[3901 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen raised an eyebrow, his eyes surprised. [[3902 旁白 neutral]]
She's so tolerant, it seems she's not a yandere after all! [[3903 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, after a long wait, Chi Xiaocheng, who had remained motionless, finally spoke. [[3904 旁白 neutral]]
"You're lying to me!" [[3905 池小橙 angry]]
Her voice was a little hoarse, as if suppressing something. [[3906 旁白 neutral]]
Snowflakes fell on Chi Xiaocheng, but quickly melted. [[3907 旁白 neutral]]
A cloud covered half of the sunlight shining on her, casting her small shadow long on the wall. [[3908 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen laughed and concluded, "Chi Xiaocheng, stop pretending!" [[3909 司辰 neutral]]
"You're lying to me!!" [[3910 池小橙 angry]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng didn't respond to him, her voice just deepened a bit. [[3911 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen scoffed, "So what if I'm lying to you? But I heard that Su Tao is going to be Ye Liang's maid. The girl you like is going to be tainted by someone else." [[3912 司辰 neutral]]
If she didn't get angry at this, then this yandere was truly fake. [[3913 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen showed a triumphant expression. [[3914 旁白 neutral]]
However, the next second. [[3915 旁白 neutral]]
His expression turned to shock. [[3916 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen felt a pain in his calf, and his whole body was pushed against the wall by a huge force. [[3917 旁白 neutral]]
Immediately after, both his legs hurt again, so weak that he couldn't stand, and he sat directly on the floor. [[3918 旁白 neutral]]
He, 1.9 meters tall, could only look up at Chi Xiaocheng now! [[3919 旁白 neutral]]
"You—" [[3920 司辰 sad]]
Before he could finish, a small knife, carried by the wind, struck! [[3921 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen almost instinctively turned his head. [[3922 旁白 neutral]]
"Thump—" [[3923 旁白 neutral]]
Dust splattered from the wall, and the small knife embedded itself three inches deep. [[3924 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng propped herself against the wall with one hand, and with the other, she gripped the small knife embedded in the wall. She leaned close to Si Chen, her pair of cat-like crimson vertical pupils eerie and terrifying. [[3925 旁白 neutral]]
A line of blood, belatedly, appeared on Si Chen's left cheek. [[3926 旁白 neutral]]
It was as red as paint on a wall, trickling out and flowing down. [[3927 旁白 neutral]]
"You are, lying to me!" [[3928 池小橙 angry]]
A hot breath hit Si Chen's face. The person in front of him was no longer that delicate loli. [[3929 旁白 neutral]]
She was like a wild beast. [[3930 旁白 neutral]]
The grin revealed not fangs, but tusks! [[3931 旁白 neutral]]
"Gulp~" [[3932 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's Adam's apple bobbed, his eyes filled with horror. [[3933 旁白 neutral]]
Sweat and warm crimson liquid dripped onto the ground, melting the accumulated snow beneath his feet. [[3934 旁白 neutral]]
He, who prided himself on being rational and calm, couldn't help but feel his heart race. [[3935 旁白 neutral]]
He turned his gaze and glanced at Chi Xiaocheng's small hand propped against the wall. [[3936 旁白 neutral]]
His shoulder moved, and he immediately wanted to resist and stop Chi Xiaocheng. [[3937 旁白 neutral]]
But what he didn't expect was. [[3938 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was faster than him! [[3939 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out and pressed down hard on his shoulder, making a "snap" sound. [[3940 旁白 neutral]]
His back shoulder hit the wall heavily, and a piercing pain shot through him. His entire right arm felt like it had lost control. [[3941 旁白 neutral]]
His shoulder was dislocated! [[3942 旁白 neutral]]
Why was Chi Xiaocheng so strong?! [[3943 旁白 neutral]]
That hand pressing on his shoulder felt as heavy as a thousand pounds. [[3944 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao is mine." [[3945 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's faint voice sounded. [[3946 旁白 neutral]]
With a "clang," the small knife was pulled out of the wall and then fiercely nailed into the wall just two inches from Si Chen's skin. [[3947 旁白 neutral]]
From the corner of his eye, he could even feel the cold glint emanating from the blade. [[3948 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao is mine!" [[3949 池小橙 angry]]
This time, Chi Xiaocheng's voice was suppressed, yet also frenzied. [[3950 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's breathing became ragged, and his lips felt dry. [[3951 旁白 neutral]]
A voice of regret echoed in his heart. [[3952 旁白 neutral]]
This... is a yandere? [[3953 司辰 sad]]
