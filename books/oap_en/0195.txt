Chapter 195: Sweating Buckets, Si Chen [[17091 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, he was just a little curious to see what gift Chi Xiaocheng had given Su Tao. [[17092 旁白 neutral]]
It was a scarecrow doll. [[17093 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, a small doll couldn't move, so there was nothing to be afraid of. [[17094 旁白 neutral]]
But Si Chen wasn't sure if it was his imagination when he unzipped the bag with a low "zip" sound. [[17095 旁白 neutral]]
A withered, twisted hand, covered in a woolly material, seemed to climb out and grab the edge of the bag, and a scarecrow's head slowly peeked out. [[17096 旁白 neutral]]
Its dark red pupils were originally deep and empty. [[17097 旁白 neutral]]
But the moment it saw Si Chen, a strange light flashed within them. [[17098 旁白 neutral]]
It just stared at the man, its mouth stretching into a strange grin, as if mocking his fear or excited about what was to come. [[17099 旁白 neutral]]
It has awakened. Time to hunt! [[17100 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen swallowed, his scalp tingling. His hand trembled, and he almost dropped the bag. [[17101 旁白 neutral]]
Such familiar red vertical pupils! [[17102 旁白 neutral]]
They were exactly the same as Chi Xiaocheng's! [[17103 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen felt his lips tremble as he looked to the side, "Su... Su Tao, this... this doll..." [[17104 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao tilted her head. "What's wrong with the doll?" [[17105 苏桃 neutral]]
She looked over, and the doll was just sitting normally in the bag. [[17106 旁白 neutral]]
Because it was a bit large, the bag had trouble holding it, so it popped out when the zipper was opened. [[17107 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao's simple words made Si Chen feel like he was on pins and needles. [[17108 旁白 neutral]]
The way this doll was looking at him felt like it wanted to... eat him! [[17109 旁白 neutral]]
He coughed lightly and forced a smile. "No... nothing. This doll is strangely cute." [[17110 司辰 neutral]]
"Well, it is a gift from Xiaocheng, after all." [[17111 苏桃 happy]]
"Haha, that's true." [[17112 司辰 neutral]]
It was just a doll, after all, even if it looked a little scary. [[17113 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen glanced back at it again. [[17114 旁白 neutral]]
He wasn't sure if it was his imagination, but he felt like the doll was constantly staring at him. [[17115 旁白 neutral]]
The slight sense of panic in his heart grew stronger when he met its crystal-like red eyes. [[17116 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be haunted? [[17117 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe Chi Xiaocheng faked her death, had a master perform a ritual, and then possessed this doll. [[17118 旁白 neutral]]
He remembered the "startup code" he mentioned at the hospital. [[17119 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen shivered and quickly pushed the bag back to Su Tao. "Here, you should take this back." [[17120 司辰 neutral]]
But Su Tao didn't take it. She placed it back in Si Chen's hands and followed Qian Qing into the changing room. [[17121 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen looked down and found himself staring at Chi Xiaocheng again. [[17122 旁白 neutral]]
A literal staring contest. [[17123 旁白 neutral]]
He was silent for a long time before slowly placing the bag on the sofa. [[17124 旁白 neutral]]
He even made sure to turn the scarecrow so it faced away from him. [[17125 旁白 neutral]]
"Dongfang Yang, don't you think that little doll is a bit strange?" [[17126 司辰 neutral]]
His question made the sunny boy look over. "No, I think it's pretty cute." [[17127 东方阳 neutral]]
Was it really just his imagination? [[17128 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at Si Chen again. "By the way, didn't you just put your clothes on? Why are you taking them off again?" [[17129 东方阳 neutral]]
"Uh... it's a bit hot. My undershirt got a little sweaty, so I'm going to change it." [[17130 司辰 neutral]]
At the same time, Qian Qing led Su Tao to the changing room. "Miss Su, I've prepared three gowns for you. See which one you like and pick one to wear." [[17131 钱清 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the three luxurious dresses hanging on the rack. [[17132 旁白 neutral]]
The most extravagant one was, without a doubt, the first. It was adorned with countless accessories and had a long train like a princess in a fairy tale. [[17133 旁白 neutral]]
Probably most women couldn't resist such a dreamy white gown. [[17134 旁白 neutral]]
However, Su Tao only glanced at it before moving on. [[17135 旁白 neutral]]
She chose the third dress, the plainest and simplest one. [[17136 旁白 neutral]]
Qian Qing raised an eyebrow. "If you think the first one is too flashy, the second one might be better." [[17137 钱清 neutral]]
"The second one is a bit too revealing. I'll stick with the third one." [[17138 苏桃 neutral]]
Qian Qing covered her mouth and chuckled. "Miss Su, you're quite modest. Most formal gowns for women are off-the-shoulder." [[17139 钱清 happy]]
However, Su Tao still shook her head. [[17140 旁白 neutral]]
Because I made a promise to her. [[17141 旁白 neutral]]
I wouldn't wear anything too revealing or flashy for public occasions. [[17142 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, the main characters here were Dongfang Yang and Qian Qing. Their red and blue outfits would definitely be one of the highlights of the event. [[17143 旁白 neutral]]
She was just here to meet the miracle doctor, so it was better to be modest and serve as a backdrop. [[17144 旁白 neutral]]
But her natural beauty and great figure were undeniable. [[17145 旁白 neutral]]
Ten minutes later, when Su Tao walked out wearing the simple, elegant, waist-cinching gown, she still stunned everyone present. [[17146 旁白 neutral]]
The pale purple gown had a vintage elegance, modest and reserved. The fabric was scattered with dark patterns, faintly twinkling like stars. [[17147 旁白 neutral]]
A thin purple ribbon was tied around her waist, gently accentuating her graceful figure. The ends of the ribbon hung down, adorned with a few sparkling gems that swayed slightly, which was the most luxurious part of the whole outfit. [[17148 旁白 neutral]]
At first glance, it wasn't striking, but if you looked at Su Tao's face first and then her whole figure, you would be amazed by her beauty. [[17149 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone reacted differently. [[17150 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked away awkwardly, trying his best to appear polite and gentlemanly. [[17151 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen only glanced at her once and never looked at Su Tao directly. [[17152 旁白 neutral]]
Qian Qing, on the other hand, smiled with admiration in her eyes. [[17153 旁白 happy]]
Among everyone, the one who stared the most intently and was most captivated was the scarecrow hidden in the bag. [[17154 旁白 neutral]]
Qian Qing walked around Su Tao, sizing her up. "Very nice. Even in this, I feel like you could be a shining star at the birthday banquet." [[17155 钱清 happy]]
Su Tao smiled shyly. "You're exaggerating, Sister Qian Qing. I can't compare to you." [[17156 苏桃 neutral]]
"Alright, let's stop with the business compliments. I'll do your hair, and then we can get going." [[17157 钱清 happy]]
Styling her hair wasn't much trouble, and she barely needed any makeup. Soon, they were all in Dongfang Yang's car. [[17158 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen immediately handed the bag to Su Tao. "You should hold onto your own bag. You won't have a place to put it during the banquet." [[17159 司辰 neutral]]
To maintain a streamlined and fitted look, the gown wasn't designed with pockets. [[17160 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao's bag, practical and cheap, looked out of place with the formal gown. [[17161 旁白 neutral]]
What's more, the bag was quite full. [[17162 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao said, "I have another small clutch for my phone, but this doll is quite big..." [[17163 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang, who was driving, glanced back. "Then just don't bring the doll. Leave it in the car." [[17164 东方阳 neutral]]
As he said that, he suddenly sucked in a breath. [[17165 旁白 neutral]]
He touched the back of his neck. "Strange, why does it feel a bit chilly? I didn't turn on the cold air." [[17166 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao hesitated for a moment, then tied Chi Xiaocheng to her waist. "I'll just bring it in like this. I'm not the main character anyway, so the attention at the banquet will be on you all. I'm just a nobody." [[17167 苏桃 neutral]]
She still preferred to trust Xiaocheng. [[17168 旁白 neutral]]
This doll might actually bring her good luck! [[17169 旁白 neutral]]
It was almost five-thirty, and the winter dusk was more than halfway over, about to turn into night. [[17170 旁白 neutral]]
The group arrived in front of a villa estate. Before they even entered the parking lot, everyone squinted their eyes in unison. [[17171 旁白 neutral]]
At the entrance of the estate, a young man in a white suit was surrounded by a crowd, like a moon surrounded by stars. [[17172 旁白 neutral]]
His mysterious aura involuntarily drew their attention, and a thought instantly popped into everyone's minds. [[17173 旁白 neutral]]
This person is the miracle doctor who has recently become famous! [[17174 旁白 neutral]]
