Chapter 2: I Like You, I Like You, I Like You [[102 旁白 neutral]]
Her low, trembling voice, like a sudden thunderclap, left the "white moonlight" female lead stunned on the bed. [[103 旁白 neutral]]
For a long time, she couldn't snap back to reality. [[104 旁白 neutral]]
The obsessive girl plan! [[105 旁白 neutral]]
This was Chi Xiaocheng's plan to get out of her difficult situation. [[106 旁白 neutral]]
The male leads already hated the original owner, and after this kidnapping incident, they would surely hate her even more. [[107 旁白 angry]]
For now, the only way to save her own life was to have the female lead stop them. [[108 旁白 neutral]]
Turning over a new leaf? [[109 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was designed to be a soft, gentle "white moonlight" type. She often overthought things and was easily influenced. [[110 旁白 neutral]]
If the male leads were a bit more assertive, she would lose her direction. She wasn't stable enough. [[111 旁白 neutral]]
Only by leaving a deep enough impression on her, making her care about and protect me, would I have a chance to survive! [[112 池小橙 neutral]]
As Chi Xiaocheng's thoughts were racing, the system in her mind kept making a "ding-ding" sound. [[113 旁白 neutral]]
[The female lead, Su Tao, is deeply shocked by the host's words.] [[114 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +3...] [[115 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +10...] [[116 系统 neutral]]
This was one of the system's main functions. As long as an important character from the original novel, whether a side character or a main character, had a strong emotional reaction to Chi Xiaocheng's actions, [[117 旁白 neutral]]
she could gain Emotion Points! [[118 旁白 happy]]
Emotion Points had many uses, including a lottery, buying items from the shop, and checking future plot developments in the novel. [[119 旁白 neutral]]
But the starter pack alone required 100 Emotion Points to open. [[120 旁白 neutral]]
Other people got theirs for free, but this system made her pay. It was a total scam. [[121 旁白 angry]]
She only had 13 Emotion Points, which was not nearly enough! [[122 旁白 sad]]
Seeing that Su Tao was too shocked to react, Chi Xiaocheng propped herself up with one hand on the edge of the bed and stood up on it. [[123 旁白 neutral]]
She was dressed simply today in a white sailor uniform and a black short skirt. In this position, she looked down from above. [[124 旁白 neutral]]
The "white moonlight" female lead slowly came back to her senses, but her eyes were still filled with panic and confusion. "Xiaocheng, I... I don't understand what you mean." [[125 苏桃 sad]]
They grew up together. [[126 旁白 neutral]]
They had been best friends for over ten years. [[127 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had always seen Chi Xiaocheng as her best friend, like a younger sister she needed to protect. [[128 旁白 neutral]]
Even though they had many conflicts in the past two years, she still believed that Chi Xiaocheng could be saved. If she just tried a little harder to correct her thinking, they would definitely go back to how they used to be. [[129 旁白 neutral]]
They would become best friends again. [[130 旁白 neutral]]
But now, she felt like she had been slapped back to reality. [[131 旁白 sad]]
Her best friend... liked her? [[132 苏桃 sad]]
Her mind was a mess, and she didn't know what to do. [[133 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't answer her question. [[134 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, Su Tao saw her lean down, placing her hands on the bed on either side of her. [[135 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wasn't even 160 cm tall. [[136 旁白 neutral]]
She was very light. [[137 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao could barely feel any weight. [[138 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng leaned in closer, and a sweet scent reached Su Tao's nose. [[139 旁白 neutral]]
Her light brown hair fell to one side of her face, and Su Tao watched as a small hand gently caressed her cheek. [[140 旁白 neutral]]
Her fingertips touched her lightly. [[141 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, Chi Xiaocheng showed a charming, fond smile. [[142 旁白 neutral]]
It was half-fake and half-genuine, done on purpose to make Su Tao realize what she was doing. [[143 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out and tucked Su Tao's messy hair behind her ear, then took a breath. [[144 旁白 neutral]]
After giving Su Tao a few seconds to react and process, [[145 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice became very gentle. "Taotao, I like you, I really, really like you. Ever since we were little, when you protected me from bullies and took my hand to lead me out of the dark corner and into the sunlight." [[146 池小橙 happy]]
"I fell hopelessly in love with you!" [[147 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng stared into Su Tao's confused eyes. "I know I have to be well-behaved to stay by your side, so I've always loved you secretly, thinking it was okay if you didn't love me back. I was happy just watching you from a distance!" [[148 池小橙 sad]]
"But, but!" Chi Xiaocheng's tone suddenly became harsh. "You always told me that I was your most precious friend, the most important person to you, the person you liked the most!" [[149 池小橙 angry]]
"If you said all that to me, why did you have to betray me!" [[150 池小橙 angry]]
Like a demon cursing from hell, Chi Xiaocheng's voice filled with resentment. "Ye Liang, Si Chen, Dongfang Yang... you already had me, so why did you have to get close to them!" [[151 池小橙 angry]]
The last sentence was almost shouted out. [[152 旁白 angry]]
Su Tao began to struggle hard, but she was completely tied up. The words she tried to say came out in a rush, "No, Xiaocheng, I was just..." [[153 苏桃 sad]]
Before she could finish, Chi Xiaocheng suddenly pinched her cheeks, cutting her off. [[154 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice became disturbingly gentle again. "No need to explain, Taotao. No matter what, I will always like you, and you can only be mine." [[155 池小橙 neutral]]
The obsessive and slightly crazed tone of her voice caught Su Tao completely off guard. [[156 旁白 neutral]]
One moment her voice was gentle, and the next it turned sharp. [[157 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao seemed to guess what Chi Xiaocheng was about to do. Seeing her get closer, she said in a panicked and anxious voice, "Xiaocheng, listen to me, whether it's Ye Liang or Dongfang Yang, I didn't..." [[158 苏桃 sad]]
"Mmph—!" [[159 苏桃 sad]]
Her voice was cut off abruptly. [[160 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes flew wide open. [[161 旁白 neutral]]
Her struggling body went still for a moment. [[162 旁白 neutral]]
Then she began to struggle even more intensely. [[163 旁白 neutral]]
[The female lead, Su Tao, is deeply shocked by the host's actions.] [[164 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +5...] [[165 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +8...] [[166 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +14...] [[167 系统 neutral]]
The notifications for Emotion Points kept popping up in her mind. [[168 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew this was because Su Tao's brain couldn't process all the information at once. [[169 旁白 neutral]]
But the starter pack still needed 100 Emotion Points, and this wasn't enough. [[170 旁白 sad]]
Feeling Su Tao's weak struggles, Chi Xiaocheng sneered inwardly. [[171 池小橙 neutral]]
She pulled back slightly, revealing her pretty, curved lips. [[172 旁白 neutral]]
Her sharp little canine teeth bit down hard. [[173 旁白 angry]]
That would leave a lasting impression. [[174 池小橙 neutral]]
Just then, the wooden door of the basement was suddenly kicked open. "Miss Su Tao!" [[175 陌生男1 angry]]
A man in a suit stood panting in the doorway, his face full of anxiety. [[176 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, he froze. [[177 旁白 neutral]]
What... is going on here? [[178 陌生男1 neutral]]
He remembered that after the young master found Miss Su Tao's location, he had frantically told him to hurry over, saying that if he were a step too late, she would be harmed. [[179 旁白 neutral]]
But looking at the scene now, [[180 旁白 neutral]]
it didn't seem like she was being harmed at all? [[181 旁白 neutral]]
The bodyguard in the suit never would have imagined such an intimate scene in the basement. [[182 旁白 neutral]]
From his side view, Su Tao was restrained, while Chi Xiaocheng was kneeling on the bed, leaning over her, as if she were... [[183 旁白 neutral]]
The scene was too beautiful; he felt a bit embarrassed to look. [[184 旁白 neutral]]
He quickly snapped back to his senses and pointed sternly at Chi Xiaocheng. "Let go of Miss Su Tao!" [[185 陌生男1 angry]]
That voice startled both Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao. [[186 旁白 neutral]]
With a push of her hand, the bed creaked, and her body lifted up lightly. [[187 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked annoyed and slowly turned her head. A few strands of hair fell over her eyes as she glanced sideways at the man, her red pupils glowing strangely in the dim light. [[188 旁白 angry]]
The small knife was somehow back in her hand. [[189 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she pressed it against Su Tao's neck. [[190 旁白 angry]]
She looked at the bodyguard coldly. "Get out, or you know what will happen!" [[191 池小橙 angry]]
