Chapter 91: The World's Correction [[7943 旁白 neutral]]
Although she had vented all her anger on the man in the raincoat, it was impossible not to be a little dissatisfied with Si Chen. [[7944 旁白 angry]]
But when Si Chen's melancholic voice came over with a photo, Chi Xiaocheng calmed down. [[7945 旁白 neutral]]
In the photo, Si Chen was shirtless, and on his muscular back were four large characters deeply carved with a knife—Never Love Tao! [[7946 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, the characters were a bit ugly, and the strokes were crooked, as if he had almost carved the wrong characters. [[7947 旁白 neutral]]
This couldn't help but remind Chi Xiaocheng of the time Si Chen had said he would carve words to show his loyalty. [[7948 旁白 neutral]]
She had originally thought it was a joke and paid no attention to it. [[7949 旁白 neutral]]
Unexpectedly, this guy had actually done it. [[7950 旁白 neutral]]
He was an ordinary person, and he didn't have a skill like her pain reduction. [[7951 旁白 neutral]]
With such a "death-exemption medal" presented, Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head and fell into deep thought. [[7952 旁白 neutral]]
The psychologist next to her saw everything. Only after Chi Xiaocheng looked up did she offer a gentle smile. "The young master is rather busy, so he asked me to communicate with Miss Chi about her future diagnosis." [[7953 林医生 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng temporarily put the matter of Si Chen aside and sat down on the sofa with the doctor. [[7954 旁白 neutral]]
The doctor spoke first, "My surname is Lin, you can just call me Dr. Lin. Young Master Si has already told me about your situation." [[7955 林医生 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked and asked cautiously, "Everything?" [[7956 池小橙 neutral]]
Dr. Lin smiled and nodded gently. "Yes, he told me everything." [[7957 林医生 neutral]]
As she spoke, she glanced at Fang Ning, who was cleaning up the bright red chicken juice that had splattered when Chen Kun killed the chicken for fun, giving a meaningful look. [[7958 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said, "Don't worry about it, you can speak freely. You said the diagnosis is in three days?" [[7959 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yes." Dr. Lin nodded. "Miss Su Tao set the time. At that time, I will need to issue a diagnostic report to Miss Su Tao, you understand." [[7960 林医生 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng naturally understood. [[7961 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao wanted the psychologist to see if she could still be cured. [[7962 旁白 neutral]]
And what she had to do was tell Su Tao that she was already beyond saving! [[7963 旁白 neutral]]
I'm a yandere, so Taotao, you can only obey me, appease me, like me, and become my one and only. [[7964 旁白 neutral]]
Otherwise, something bad might happen to me. [[7965 旁白 neutral]]
She said to Dr. Lin, "In the report, please write that it's very serious. It would be best to say I have something like multiple personality disorder, with a 99% chance of being difficult to treat." [[7966 池小橙 neutral]]
Dr. Lin looked at Chi Xiaocheng and nodded. "You want Miss Su Tao to think you're a lost cause." [[7967 林医生 neutral]]
"Yes." [[7968 池小橙 neutral]]
Dr. Lin: "I have also studied yandere. If you need me to diagnose a type, what type would you like it to be?" [[7969 林医生 neutral]]
"Dependent and possessive types. These are the two types I'm currently acting out in front of Taotao." [[7970 池小橙 neutral]]
Dr. Lin looked thoughtful, gave Chi Xiaocheng a few more glances, and then nodded gently. [[7971 旁白 neutral]]
For some reason, she asked, "Miss Chi, do you think a yandere knows they are a yandere?" [[7972 林医生 neutral]]
"Of course a yandere doesn't know they are a yandere." [[7973 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng answered almost instantly, full of confidence. [[7974 旁白 neutral]]
Then, after chatting with Dr. Lin for a long time, especially asking many questions about psychology, Chi Xiaocheng sent her off with satisfaction. [[7975 旁白 happy]]
She had enriched her knowledge of psychology, which, as a doctor-in-training, would allow her to be more convincing when fooling Su Tao. [[7976 旁白 neutral]]
Although Si Chen was a bit utilitarian, he was still reliable. [[7977 旁白 neutral]]
The premise was that she had enough benefits to tie him to her ship. [[7978 旁白 neutral]]
However, there was one thing that made Chi Xiaocheng a little conflicted. [[7979 旁白 neutral]]
"System, why is it that sometimes my blackening skill doesn't work when I try to act it out, but when it's related to Taotao, my acting works?" [[7980 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing this, the system's tone perked up. [[7981 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, are you starting to think you're a little abnormal?] [[7982 系统 neutral]]
"I'm perfectly normal." Chi Xiaocheng rolled her eyes and said in her mind, "I summarized the experience from last time with Ye Liang. I originally thought it was Ye Liang's male lead halo that suppressed me, and then after Taotao's female lead halo counteracted Ye Liang's halo, I was able to trigger the blackening skill." [[7983 池小橙 neutral]]
[Um... so what do you think the reason is, Host?] [[7984 系统 neutral]]
"It's because my relationship with Taotao has improved. I've not only leeched off her female lead halo, but I've also changed the world line. I was originally a cannon fodder supporting character, but now my character's importance has increased!" [[7985 池小橙 happy]]
"Naturally, Taotao's female lead halo is also a big factor, so I can only blacken when Taotao is mentioned. That's reasonable, right?" [[7986 池小橙 neutral]]
This time, the system rarely answered her directly. [[7987 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, it took a while before it slowly said. [[7988 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, I think you have a very good point] [[7989 系统 neutral]]
"You agree with me?" [[7990 池小橙 happy]]
[I'm referring to the point about your character's importance increasing] [[7991 系统 neutral]]
The system's words left Chi Xiaocheng a little confused. The trigger for the blackening skill this time was clearly because of the female lead halo, right? [[7992 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen mentioned Su Tao, so the anger she was acting out was able to successfully activate the blackening. [[7993 旁白 neutral]]
Before Su Tao was mentioned, the acting she tried when facing the man in the raincoat didn't trigger any anger at all. [[7994 旁白 neutral]]
However, the focus the system provided was not on the blackening, but on the man in the raincoat. [[7995 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, you actually know that the male leads Dongfang Yang and Si Chen are temporarily on your and the female lead Su Tao's side, and have sent bodyguards to protect you nearby, right?] [[7996 系统 neutral]]
"That's right, what's wrong?" [[7997 池小橙 neutral]]
[The villain supporting character Chi Song was also called back by you. Given how much he values you, it's impossible that he wouldn't have people watching in the neighborhood] [[7998 系统 neutral]]
With the system's reminder, Chi Xiaocheng quickly reacted. [[7999 旁白 neutral]]
That's right, Dongfang Yang had said that he was afraid she would continue to be bullied and had sent two bodyguards to watch the area. [[8000 旁白 neutral]]
Her brother also said he had left some of his men near the house. [[8001 旁白 neutral]]
There was a security guard at the entrance, and many residents in the community. [[8002 旁白 neutral]]
That man in the raincoat came to her house unobstructed? [[8003 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng frowned and immediately went to the community's security room, asking the security guard to check the surveillance footage of her floor. [[8004 旁白 neutral]]
The security guard let out a confused sound, "That's strange. The community's security equipment was just serviced last month. All the broken cameras were replaced, and new ones were added. But the cameras at your door and on the first floor are both broken." [[8005 保安 neutral]]
Upon checking, the other cameras showed no sign of the man in the raincoat. [[8006 旁白 neutral]]
Some of the cameras he couldn't avoid were simply broken! [[8007 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't believe that the man in the raincoat was a top hacker who had also hacked the surveillance while committing the crime. [[8008 旁白 neutral]]
The security guard said, "I'll go and see what's wrong with the camera." [[8009 保安 neutral]]
"I'll go with you." [[8010 池小橙 neutral]]
They returned to the hallway in front of her door. [[8011 旁白 neutral]]
The surveillance camera was physically damaged. [[8012 旁白 neutral]]
The specific cause was unknown. [[8013 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, Chi Xiaocheng felt a chill run down her spine, a feeling of being watched. [[8014 旁白 sad]]
[Host, you should understand something now, right?] [[8015 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a deep breath and slowly voiced her suspicion, "Is this world trying to... kill me?" [[8016 池小橙 sad]]
[To be precise, it's rejection and correction] [[8017 系统 neutral]]
[As the sole female lead, Su Tao's role is significant, and Ye Liang is one of the male leads with a heavier weight in the plot. By your own means, you caused a rift between the two who were supposed to be together and even sent Ye Liang to the hospital, greatly altering the original story] [[8018 系统 neutral]]
[And this man in the raincoat is probably the world's way of correcting its course] [[8019 系统 neutral]]
She was a transmigrator, an anomaly after all! [[8020 旁白 neutral]]
But to have Chi Xiaocheng follow the original plot? [[8021 旁白 neutral]]
Absolutely not! [[8022 旁白 angry]]
"System, is there a solution?" [[8023 池小橙 neutral]]
A trace of unease crept into Chi Xiaocheng's previously relaxed heart. [[8024 旁白 sad]]
And the system, which she had always called useless, answered this time with determination. [[8025 旁白 neutral]]
[Yes!] [[8026 系统 happy]]
