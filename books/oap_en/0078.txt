Chapter 78 Su Tao's "Future" [[6823 旁白 neutral]]
The moment she thought of the words "drinking alcohol," Su Tao felt an indescribable sense of rejection. [[6824 旁白 neutral]]
But this feeling, surprisingly, made her feel much better mentally! [[6825 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if all negative emotions were less profound than such a strong, tangible sensation. [[6826 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao reached out without any hesitation and took out a bottle of white wine. [[6827 旁白 neutral]]
Without even caring how strong the white wine was, she directly twisted open the cap, not even needing a glass. [[6828 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if, on the verge of collapse, she had grasped the last straw. [[6829 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly closed her eyes. [[6830 旁白 neutral]]
Her throat bobbed. She had never drunk alcohol with such a high proof before, and her throat felt like it was on fire. [[6831 旁白 neutral]]
While gasping for air, she reached out and wiped away the tears that welled up in her eyes. [[6832 旁白 neutral]]
A large amount of endorphins were secreted, and a strange pleasure made Su Tao feel much more comfortable. [[6833 旁白 neutral]]
All the previous pressure, struggle, confusion, fear, and other emotions were cast aside at this moment. [[6834 旁白 neutral]]
After resting for a while, Su Tao rinsed her mouth and took a bath. [[6835 旁白 neutral]]
Hot water flowed from above her head, soaking her hair and then flowing over her smooth skin. [[6836 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao emptied her mind, like a person rescued from drowning, breathing in small gulps, and avoiding the root cause of her current state. [[6837 旁白 neutral]]
After bathing, she dried her hair. [[6838 旁白 neutral]]
Since things had come to this, she might as well sleep first. [[6839 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't need to think about anything, nor did she need to care about anything. [[6840 旁白 neutral]]
This feeling was truly relaxing. [[6841 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since she drank that glass of wine, her head felt a little dizzy, and Su Tao felt like she had entered an extremely comfortable state. [[6842 旁白 neutral]]
As long as she could stay in this room, in this place full of memories, it would be enough. [[6843 旁白 neutral]]
She threw her phone, watch, and sachet in the living room, and then staggered to Chi Xiaocheng's room. [[6844 旁白 neutral]]
She threw herself onto the bed and hugged the large panda pillow that Chi Xiaocheng usually hugged when she slept. [[6845 旁白 neutral]]
She buried her pretty face in the pillow and took a deep breath. [[6846 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng's scent." [[6847 苏桃 neutral]]
Like. [[6848 苏桃 neutral]]
What am I holding now? [[6849 苏桃 neutral]]
A pillow? [[6850 苏桃 neutral]]
That's not right. [[6851 苏桃 neutral]]
I'm holding Xiaocheng. [[6852 苏桃 neutral]]
Yes, it's time to sleep with Xiaocheng now. [[6853 苏桃 neutral]]
It's so comfortable to be with Xiaocheng without having to think about anything. [[6854 苏桃 neutral]]
She pulled the blanket over with one hand, and her tired eyes gradually closed. [[6855 旁白 neutral]]
Her small mouth mumbled to herself in a daze. [[6856 旁白 neutral]]
"So sleepy... I really want to sleep." [[6857 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng seems to be in the hospital. Is she waiting for me there?" [[6858 苏桃 sad]]
"But if I go to the hospital, it will be uncomfortable. Will she show her yandere side to me again?" [[6859 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng... is really not as comfortable as here." [[6860 苏桃 sad]]
The scent of the sachet is so good. [[6861 苏桃 neutral]]
As if all the burdens on her shoulders had been lifted, Su Tao fell into a deep sleep. [[6862 旁白 neutral]]
She was too tired. After continuous high pressure, Ye Liang forced her to make a choice, finally breaking her last string. [[6863 旁白 neutral]]
Her subconscious began to protect her body and mind. [[6864 旁白 neutral]]
Not thinking. [[6865 旁白 neutral]]
Escaping reality. [[6866 旁白 neutral]]
While Su Tao was asleep, Chi Xiaocheng happened to wake up slowly in the hospital. [[6867 旁白 neutral]]
She opened her eyes and looked for a familiar figure, but saw no one. [[6868 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao is not here." [[6869 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice was a little regretful. She struggled to reach for her phone on the bedside table and then clicked on a mysterious mini-program. [[6870 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, rest first.] [[6871 系统 neutral]]
"Rest?" Chi Xiaocheng skillfully spent 100 emotion points from the system store to exchange for a healing pill and threw it into her mouth. [[6872 池小橙 neutral]]
She slowly said, "I don't like resting in an empty hospital room. The smell of disinfectant here isn't good at all. Of course, I want to sleep in Tao Tao's arms when I rest." [[6873 池小橙 neutral]]
The mini-program on her phone opened, and a flashing location appeared on a familiar spot on the map. [[6874 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao is actually at my house?" [[6875 池小橙 surprised]]
This was a mini-program Chi Xiaocheng customized using the simple hacker toolset she got from the system's gacha. She had prepared it early. [[6876 旁白 neutral]]
With the system's help, no matter where Su Tao was, she could know her location. [[6877 旁白 neutral]]
After all, none of the skills given by the system were weak. [[6878 旁白 neutral]]
However, what puzzled Chi Xiaocheng at this moment was why Su Tao was at her house? [[6879 旁白 neutral]]
At this time, Su Tao was hugging her panda, sleeping soundly. [[6880 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took some time to understand the whole process. [[6881 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, her eyes became eerie and terrifying, "She actually chose to escape. Tao Tao is truly sad~" [[6882 池小橙 sad]]
At this moment, the system in her mind spoke. [[6883 旁白 neutral]]
[Host... Host, it's normal for Su Tao to escape. It's not just the pressure you gave her, but also Si Chen, Chen Qian, and Doctor Cheng's alias. With pressure from multiple sides, she had already reached her limit.] [[6884 系统 neutral]]
[Ye Liang was the fuse that ignited the dynamite. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if Su Tao completely collapsed from this.] [[6885 系统 neutral]]
"She won't collapse that easily." Chi Xiaocheng smiled faintly, "You know, she's the female lead. In the original novel, according to the plot I know, she only collapsed twice in total." [[6886 池小橙 neutral]]
"The first time was after she learned that the original owner was drowned. Because the original owner had scratched her face and pierced her chest, and her vicious words made her briefly lose her mind and feel despair. With a little instigation from Ye Liang, she let Ye Liang deal with the original owner." [[6887 池小橙 neutral]]
"Perhaps the her in the book thought that Ye Liang was just punishing the original owner." [[6888 池小橙 neutral]]
"But who would have thought of Ye Liang's ruthlessness? After being beaten to the brink of death for several days, the original owner was drowned in the sea by Ye Liang's subordinate. [[6889 池小橙 neutral]]
"Everything from childhood became a memory with the original owner's departure. Su Tao even believed that her neglect of the original owner led to the original owner being corrupted and then killed by Ye Liang. Countless emotions surged into her heart, leading to a breakdown." [[6890 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had spent a lot of emotion points recently to catch up on the original plot. Although she hadn't finished the entire book, she had read the first fifth, plus the part about Su Tao's ending. [[6891 旁白 neutral]]
"And the second collapse was at the very end." [[6892 池小橙 neutral]]
"No matter how much of a white moonlight the female lead was, she couldn't defeat the author's pen." [[6893 池小橙 neutral]]
"The sudden appearance of a wealthy female supporting character pressed her step by step. People around her betrayed her one by one. Several times, she went from hope to despair, yet she still bravely endured countless pressures." [[6894 池小橙 neutral]]
"Only at the very end, when she found an old photo of herself and the original owner in her small rented room, did she suddenly realize." [[6895 池小橙 neutral]]
"The people who cared about her the most were actually the original owner's family." [[6896 池小橙 neutral]]
"And Chi Xiaocheng, including her family, in a sense, died because of her." [[6897 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng leaned against the headboard, looking at the ceiling, "System, do you know, from a results-oriented perspective, from Su Tao's perspective, the original owner probably never hated her." [[6898 池小橙 neutral]]
"Not allowing her to contact Ye Liang, because in the middle and late stages, Ye Liang did betray Su Tao. Was the original owner's behavior not protecting Su Tao?" [[6899 池小橙 neutral]]
"Thinking that Ye Liang was only interested in Su Tao because of her looks, so if her face and chest were ruined, would Ye Liang dislike Su Tao?" [[6900 池小橙 neutral]]
"Confessing to the various male leads, wasn't there a possibility of getting involved herself?" [[6901 池小橙 neutral]]
These were not Chi Xiaocheng's conjectures, but the ending in the original novel. Su Tao only realized and inferred these things after recalling them. [[6902 旁白 neutral]]
Every word she said was written in the original novel. [[6903 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps it was the author's conscience. While writing Su Tao's death, he whitewashed the original owner, making her Su Tao's only one, so that a female lead who had been written for thousands of chapters wouldn't end up unloved. [[6904 旁白 neutral]]
Inferring the process from the result of the original work. [[6905 旁白 neutral]]
The original owner, Brother Chi Song, her caring parents, and her war god father. These "cannon fodder supporting characters" who died early were the few people who truly loved her throughout the thousands of chapters of the book. [[6906 旁白 neutral]]
