Chapter 230: Fang Ning [[19791 旁白 neutral]]
Which one should I choose? [[19792 苏桃 neutral]]
Wasn't the old man just using his son's story to emphasize his own point? [[19793 苏桃 neutral]]
The girl was like Xiaocheng with amnesia. [[19794 苏桃 neutral]]
And his son, like me now, was facing a choice. [[19795 苏桃 neutral]]
Thinking rationally, I should choose to build a fake home for her. She had no family left, and this would let her live happily. [[19796 苏桃 neutral]]
But Su Tao hadn't forgotten what the old man said before. [[19797 旁白 neutral]]
Even if they tried to hide it, she might remember the past because of some event or a dream. [[19798 旁白 neutral]]
So... [[19799 苏桃 neutral]]
"I choose to awaken her past memories." [[19800 苏桃 neutral]]
If it were the current Xiaocheng, I think I would also choose to awaken her memories directly. [[19801 苏桃 neutral]]
The complete Xiaocheng is the real Xiaocheng, right? [[19802 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up, having made her decision. [[19803 旁白 neutral]]
The old man caught the hint of confidence in her tone, feeling she had made the right choice. [[19804 旁白 neutral]]
He chuckled softly. "A bit of a clever shortcut, but that was indeed my son's choice too." [[19805 老大爷 happy]]
"During her treatment, the girl was very positive, optimistic, and cheerful. Many nurses and doctors who met her liked her a lot. Because of her attitude, her treatment was very effective." [[19806 老大爷 neutral]]
"Considering her personality, my son ultimately chose not to deceive her with a lie." [[19807 老大爷 neutral]]
"He told her the truth. We thought we would need other ways to awaken her memories, but after she learned the truth, she remembered everything." [[19808 老大爷 neutral]]
"That day, she hugged my son and cried a lot, then smiled and said she was okay." [[19809 老大爷 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao couldn't help but smile. [[19810 旁白 happy]]
As expected, that was the right choice. She got her memories back, faced her past, became her true self, and lived happily ever after with the old man's son. [[19811 苏桃 happy]]
People always hope for a happy ending. [[19812 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was no different. [[19813 旁白 neutral]]
Just as her smile bloomed, the old man sighed. "When we saw the girl's brave smile, we all thought everything was really okay." [[19814 老大爷 sad]]
His words made Su Tao freeze. [[19815 旁白 neutral]]
His voice continued, "That day, we all felt relieved and relaxed. My son even told her he would take care of her for the rest of his life." [[19816 老大爷 sad]]
"But the girl didn't agree. My son thought she was just being shy, so he didn't think much of it." [[19817 老大爷 neutral]]
"That night, she jumped from the seventh floor of the hospital." [[19818 老大爷 sad]]
Hearing his calm words, Su Tao covered her mouth in disbelief. [[19819 旁白 sad]]
The old man continued, "In her room, we found a suicide note. She was very grateful for the help from my son and the doctors, but she couldn't accept the death of her family, that extremely painful past." [[19820 老大爷 sad]]
"At that time, we wondered if it would have been better to create a fake home for her, to let her forget the past forever." [[19821 老大爷 sad]]
The story ended there. [[19822 旁白 neutral]]
The old man's tone carried a hint of gentle regret. "You said your sister forgot you because of a painful mental illness. You have to think about whether waking her memories will bring her pain or happiness." [[19823 老大爷 neutral]]
Su Tao fell silent. [[19824 旁白 neutral]]
She realized she was being a little selfish. [[19825 苏桃 sad]]
When hesitating about whether to awaken Xiaocheng's memories, she was mostly thinking about herself. [[19826 苏桃 sad]]
Just like in Cheng Cheng's message, the decision to awaken her depended on whether she wanted to enjoy a Xiaocheng who wasn't a yandere. [[19827 苏桃 neutral]]
And wasn't that the reason for her hesitation? [[19828 苏桃 neutral]]
The old man tapped the ground with his guide cane and walked toward his hospital room. "Child, don't forget the real reason for amnesia. You should think about it carefully." [[19829 老大爷 neutral]]
After saying that, he returned to his room. [[19830 旁白 neutral]]
The evening wind had been blowing for a long time. [[19831 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took out her phone to check. Cheng Cheng hadn't sent any messages to rush her. [[19832 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps she knew this was a question I would need a long time to think about. [[19833 苏桃 neutral]]
Why do people get amnesia? [[19834 苏桃 neutral]]
To forget painful things from the past. [[19835 苏桃 neutral]]
So, they choose to abandon the past, as if cheating by getting stuck, only able to move forward, forward, forward. [[19836 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao stood on the balcony in the evening wind for a long time, watching the fireworks bloom and fade. [[19837 旁白 neutral]]
She picked up her phone again and saw it was already midnight without realizing it. [[19838 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took out her phone, thought for a moment, and replied to Cheng Cheng, "I don't really want to awaken Xiaocheng's past memories." [[19839 苏桃 sad]]
Cheng Cheng seemed to have been waiting for her reply. She first sent an interesting sticker, then slowly typed. [[19840 旁白 neutral]]
"So you want to stop Xiaocheng from becoming a yandere so you can have her all to yourself." [[19841 程程 neutral]]
"If waking up makes Xiaocheng remember all those painful things, wouldn't it be better to let her forget?" [[19842 苏桃 sad]]
"But isn't she still angry with you now?" [[19843 程程 neutral]]
"Ye Liang is already dead. There will be a chance to make things right. She won't hate me forever." [[19844 苏桃 neutral]]
"But, with this choice, doesn't it mean you're once again running away from her yandere side?" [[19845 程程 neutral]]
If you love her, you should accept everything about her. [[19846 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao knew this, of course. In fact, that's what she was just thinking. [[19847 旁白 neutral]]
But what if her past avoidance and rejection were also painful for Xiaocheng? [[19848 苏桃 sad]]
Forgetting might be the better choice, right? [[19849 苏桃 sad]]
Otherwise, what if she's like the girl the old man talked about? What if, like before, she chooses to end her life again? [[19850 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao wanted to add in her heart, "This is all for Xiaocheng's good," but as she looked down, she just felt a tightness in her chest. [[19851 旁白 sad]]
A message from Cheng Cheng arrived. "If I were her, I would want you to awaken me. She loves you so much that even if the memories are painful, the good would surely outweigh the bad." [[19852 程程 neutral]]
"As a yandere, she would want you to love all of her, not just the version of her without the illness." [[19853 程程 neutral]]
The message ended, followed by a "good night." [[19854 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stared at the message, lost in thought. [[19855 旁白 neutral]]
Did I make the wrong choice again? [[19856 苏桃 sad]]
But I just don't want Xiaocheng to remember her painful past. Is that wrong too? [[19857 苏桃 sad]]
If I choose to awaken her, does that mean I actually want her to fall into deeper pain? Would that be proof that I don't love her? [[19858 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao rubbed her head. She was no longer sure which choice was the right one. [[19859 旁白 sad]]
Anyway, even if I don't actively try to awaken Xiaocheng's memories, maybe she'll gradually remember things on her own through daily life? [[19860 苏桃 neutral]]
Xiaocheng still dislikes me now, so what's the use of thinking so much? [[19861 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao let out a self-mocking laugh and slowly returned to her room. [[19862 旁白 sad]]
She didn't sleep well that night, thinking about the conversation with Cheng Cheng and the old man. [[19863 旁白 neutral]]
She wondered if the decision she had made was right or wrong. [[19864 旁白 neutral]]
Hesitation isn't necessarily a flaw. People who hesitate often consider more options, eliminating the wrong answers one by one. [[19865 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt she still had time to think about this problem. [[19866 旁白 neutral]]
But... was there really time? [[19867 旁白 neutral]]
Waking up in the hospital in the morning, she washed up and planned to take the elevator to the 8th floor. However, when the elevator doors opened, she saw a familiar figure. [[19868 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning, holding a bag of fruit, was standing quietly in the corner of the elevator. [[19869 旁白 neutral]]
