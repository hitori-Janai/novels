Chapter 52 She is a True Yandere! [[4541 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps there was a problem with her taste buds. [[4542 旁白 neutral]]
Or perhaps the high pressure was too terrifying. [[4543 旁白 neutral]]
Even though it was a bowl of old hen soup, Su Tao found it hard to swallow. [[4544 旁白 neutral]]
Sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, as if countless flavors were combined, coupled with Chi Xiaocheng's slightly eerie, strange smile. [[4545 旁白 neutral]]
Scene after scene flashed rapidly through her mind. [[4546 旁白 neutral]]
In the basement, Chi Xiaocheng leaned into her ear, emphasizing that she couldn't like Ye Liang, questioning why she would abandon her. [[4547 旁白 neutral]]
On the rooftop, she forced herself to say she liked her, the thunder roaring in the rainy night. [[4548 旁白 neutral]]
That obsessed face kept repeating to her—we must be together forever. [[4549 旁白 neutral]]
Like a black and white television with a bad signal, scene after scene played and accelerated, accompanied by hoarse, grating sounds. [[4550 旁白 neutral]]
Her heart beat faster and faster, and gradually, only the roaring after the sonic boom remained, lingering endlessly. [[4551 旁白 neutral]]
Everything that happened seemed to be just a momentary trance. [[4552 旁白 neutral]]
Until Chi Xiaocheng's voice sounded, "What's wrong, Tao Tao?" [[4553 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly looked up, her lips trembling, but she still didn't say that the chicken soup tasted like a combination of chili, bitter gourd, vinegar, and many other seasonings. [[4554 旁白 neutral]]
What kind of restaurant was this? The food was completely dark cuisine! [[4555 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head in confusion, picked up a piece of chicken with chopsticks, "It tastes fine, normal flavor." [[4556 池小橙 neutral]]
That's not right, could it be that my taste buds are having a problem... [[4557 旁白 neutral]]
Before she could recover, on that cute, doll-like face, a pair of crimson vertical pupils, completely opposite to human eyes, stared at her obsessively, her smile as eerie as ever. [[4558 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom—" [[4559 旁白 neutral]]
Thunder roared outside the sealed window, just like that night on the rooftop. [[4560 旁白 neutral]]
The crimson rainy night, whether it dispelled the darkness or dyed it even deeper. [[4561 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng... is a true yandere! [[4562 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps she herself didn't know, she contradicted herself, and even might have two personalities, but undoubtedly. [[4563 旁白 neutral]]
From this moment on, Su Tao could confirm that Chi Xiaocheng— [[4564 旁白 neutral]]
Is a yandere! [[4565 旁白 neutral]]
Fear and dread spread from her spine throughout her body, and her breathing seemed to become difficult. [[4566 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't that her taste buds had a problem, but that Xiaocheng had a problem. She had actually become a yandere! [[4567 旁白 neutral]]
In her ear, Chi Xiaocheng's disappointed voice sounded again, "Tao Tao doesn't like the takeout I ordered, does that mean she doesn't like me?" [[4568 池小橙 sad]]
She turned her head in disappointment, standing up like a puppet. [[4569 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao thought of the novel she had just read, which seemed to have a similar plot. [[4570 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly shouted, "No!" [[4571 苏桃 neutral]]
"Of course I don't dislike Xiaocheng. I actually... haha, it's because the takeout is too delicious, I just liked it for a moment." [[4572 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao's smile was stiff and bitter. She quickly picked up the bowl and praised Chi Xiaocheng while eating. [[4573 旁白 neutral]]
There was nothing she could do. She had to say she liked Xiaocheng. [[4574 旁白 neutral]]
This was the pressure Chi Xiaocheng brought. If she didn't say she liked her, she would become a yandere. [[4575 旁白 neutral]]
It made her feel as if her throat was being squeezed little by little, making it difficult to breathe. [[4576 旁白 neutral]]
I'm just pretending to like Xiaocheng, just pretending to like her, just to humor her. There's nothing I can do, right... [[4577 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao comforted herself inwardly, enduring her fear of Chi Xiaocheng, and with difficulty finished this dinner. [[4578 旁白 neutral]]
She forced a smile, "Thank you, Xiaocheng." [[4579 苏桃 neutral]]
But this smile was extremely forced. Rather than a smile, it was more like Su Tao forcefully changing her facial muscles to appease this little one who seemed to have lost her mind. [[4580 旁白 neutral]]
As Su Tao said this, Chi Xiaocheng "indeed" returned from that strange state. [[4581 旁白 neutral]]
Smiling brightly, extremely cute, "Mm, as long as Tao Tao likes it~" [[4582 池小橙 happy]]
Her strange vertical pupils returned to normal, and the crimson in her eyes gradually faded. [[4583 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt very uncomfortable eating this entire takeout meal, as if it wasn't normal human food at all, with no normal taste. [[4584 旁白 neutral]]
After eating half, Su Tao felt it was hard to swallow, and quickly pushed the rest away. [[4585 旁白 neutral]]
"Actually, I'm not very hungry. This is enough. By the way, how long have I been asleep?" [[4586 苏桃 neutral]]
She quickly changed the subject, feeling her taste buds protesting. [[4587 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng just picked up the bowl and shook her head slightly, "I don't know how long it's been, Tao Tao. Since you're full, I'll come back in an hour~" [[4588 池小橙 neutral]]
After saying that, she didn't give Su Tao a chance to ask further and happily walked out the door. [[4589 旁白 neutral]]
Until the moment the door closed. [[4590 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly grabbed the corner of the nearby table, half-bent over, looking down at the ground, one hand clutching her heart, gasping for breath. [[4591 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's pressure was too great. [[4592 旁白 neutral]]
The takeout from the restaurant was also dark cuisine. [[4593 旁白 neutral]]
Even when she was a child, picking up trash to eat alone, she had never felt so uncomfortable eating a meal. [[4594 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had a headache, and what she couldn't understand even more was, what was Chi Xiaocheng's purpose in keeping her in this room? [[4595 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know, and didn't dare to look at that novel. After hiding it under the pillow, she lay weakly on the bed, her eyes lost in thought. [[4596 旁白 neutral]]
Six hours of rest had greatly relieved her body. [[4597 旁白 neutral]]
But now, the mental impact was far greater than the physical. [[4598 旁白 neutral]]
"One hour..." Su Tao murmured, "Later, if Xiaocheng's emotions are stable, should I ask again?" [[4599 苏桃 neutral]]
She silently counted the time in her heart, but when she felt about 15 minutes had passed, the door opened. [[4600 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng struggled to carry a bucket of water, swaying as she walked in. [[4601 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, it's time to take a bath." [[4602 池小橙 neutral]]
Towel, shampoo, body wash, change of clothes. [[4603 旁白 neutral]]
Everything was ready. [[4604 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng placed all the accompanying items on the floor and smiled gently at Su Tao, "Sorry, the bathroom is broken, so you'll have to manage in the room. It's okay if the floor gets wet, I'll clean it up later." [[4605 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's smile stiffened once more. [[4606 旁白 neutral]]
She could already confirm that Chi Xiaocheng just wanted to keep her here. [[4607 旁白 neutral]]
Strength... [[4608 旁白 neutral]]
Still couldn't be mustered. [[4609 旁白 neutral]]
Did an hour pass so quickly? [[4610 旁白 neutral]]
Why hadn't she regained her strength after so long? [[4611 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed that seeing Su Tao not moving, Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head blankly, then suddenly thought of something, and her face immediately turned red. [[4612 旁白 neutral]]
She glanced away, saying shyly, "D-do you... do you want me to help you bathe, Tao Tao? This... isn't this too fast? Oh, I'm so shy..." [[4613 池小橙 sad]]
"No... no need, I'll do it myself." [[4614 苏桃 neutral]]
Someone else bathing her, and in such an open, almost empty room, the intense shame even overshadowed the uneasiness in Su Tao's heart. [[4615 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng placed her index finger on her lips and smiled mysteriously, "Then I'll come back later, in... half an hour." [[4616 池小橙 neutral]]
"Wait, Xiaocheng!" [[4617 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao called out to Chi Xiaocheng, "After you've showered, can we... can we talk properly?" [[4618 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay!" [[4619 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng responded and slowly walked out the door. [[4620 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the drizzling sky, she happily walked towards the sofa. [[4621 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, you actually gave up such a good opportunity. You're not villainous enough.] [[4622 系统 neutral]]
"You don't understand, System. Su Tao is currently at a stage where, since we're both girls, it's not a big deal anyway. Even if I said I'd help her bathe, she would only overthink things related to my yandere tendencies." [[4623 池小橙 neutral]]
"Physical contact like that needs to wait until she becomes curious about me." [[4624 池小橙 neutral]]
"Only when she blushes at the thought of 'why is Xiaocheng so special, even though we're both girls?' is what you call a good opportunity." [[4625 池小橙 neutral]]
"Such things cannot be allowed for Tao Tao to adapt to in advance." [[4626 池小橙 neutral]]
"After all, I need her to realize that I, as a girl, am also unique!" [[4627 池小橙 neutral]]
That glass of water today, she must have realized my softness, right? [[4628 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took out an item she got from the system's gacha. [[4629 旁白 neutral]]
Delicate Soft Candy: Consuming it can make skin more delicate. [[4630 旁白 neutral]]
So next, how about something more profound? [[4631 旁白 neutral]]
