Chapter 11: An Important Plot Point, the School Basketball Game [[895 旁白 neutral]]
After returning home, Chi Xiaocheng received a message from Chen Qian. [[896 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao is already back at the dorm. She looks a bit pale and distracted." [[897 陈倩 neutral]]
As a spy on the same side, even though she was annoyed with Chi Xiaocheng, she was being blackmailed. So, she was willing to betray Su Tao, who was her friend on the surface. [[898 旁白 neutral]]
Not long after they parted, she sent a message to Chi Xiaocheng to test her, wanting to find out what her true intentions were. [[899 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Chi Xiaocheng quickly typed a reply: "I need you to take very good care of her. For the next few days, find reasons to stay close to her and tell me if she does or thinks anything important." [[900 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "Take very good care of her? Are you serious?" [[901 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Just do as I say." [[902 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao was very innocent. Since Chen Qian hadn't been exposed yet, she was definitely considered a good friend. Living in the same dorm, they would talk about many things. [[903 旁白 neutral]]
After the emotional rollercoaster she had been through, Su Tao didn't dare to talk to Ye Liang and the others, so she needed someone to rely on for a while. [[904 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian was the perfect person for that. [[905 旁白 neutral]]
On one hand, she could act as my spy to get information. On the other hand, she could gain Su Tao's trust. Once Su Tao believed Chen Qian was a true friend... [[906 旁白 neutral]]
At a critical moment. [[907 旁白 neutral]]
*Stab!* [[908 旁白 neutral]]
A devastating backstab would come. [[909 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Chi Xiaocheng could step in and capture the female lead's fragile heart. [[910 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, this was all part of her plan. Next, she needed to deal with the next plot point from the original novel. [[911 旁白 neutral]]
The school basketball game! [[912 旁白 happy]]
Dongfang Yang would lead the Red Team. [[913 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang would lead the Blue Team. [[914 旁白 neutral]]
The two would face off in the finals of the school basketball tournament! [[915 旁白 happy]]
In female-oriented novels, this kind of match was just a way to show how handsome the two male leads were. It also served to involve the female lead, creating the satisfying trope where it seems like the two male leads are competing in a game, but they are actually competing for her. [[916 旁白 neutral]]
Even though her arrival had created a butterfly effect, Su Tao would still undoubtedly go to the game to cheer for both male leads. [[917 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was thinking about how she, as a third party, could interfere with the plot of this game. [[918 旁白 neutral]]
And at the same time, get closer to Su Tao. [[919 旁白 neutral]]
At the very least, she couldn't let Su Tao keep avoiding her. Chi Xiaocheng was now sending messages to Su Tao, but the female lead wasn't replying at all. [[920 旁白 neutral]]
"Just in case, I should draw another skill." [[921 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the System panel. This was another function of the system besides the store. [[922 旁白 neutral]]
Lottery! [[923 旁白 happy]]
100 Emotion Points for one draw. [[924 旁白 neutral]]
1000 Emotion Points for a ten-draw, which guaranteed at least one low-level skill. [[925 旁白 neutral]]
Skills were different from the strange items in the store. Chi Xiaocheng had experienced how powerful the System's skills were. [[926 旁白 neutral]]
Acting (Intermediate), Pain Reduction (Intermediate), Spiked Liquid (Beginner). [[927 旁白 neutral]]
The three skills she currently had, just the intermediate Acting skill alone, had been a huge help to Chi Xiaocheng. [[928 旁白 neutral]]
"Go big or go home!" [[929 池小橙 happy]]
"Draw!" [[930 池小橙 happy]]
After spending another 100 Emotion Points, the System's lottery panel suddenly flashed with a golden light. [[931 旁白 happy]]
"I got a skill?!" [[932 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's face lit up with surprise, "And it's an intermediate skill!" [[933 池小橙 happy]]
But the moment she saw the skill's name, Chi Xiaocheng froze, and her expression turned strange. [[934 旁白 neutral]]
"Is a skill like this really useful for my current situation?" [[935 池小橙 sad]]
Time quickly passed to November 5th, Tuesday. [[936 旁白 neutral]]
The day of the school basketball game. [[937 旁白 neutral]]
To avoid the other male leads who might still be angry, and that group of two-faced friends, Chi Xiaocheng skipped classes for a day. [[938 旁白 neutral]]
But today was the day a small climax of the plot would unfold. [[939 旁白 neutral]]
At 5 PM, the game was scheduled to start. [[940 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng left early and went to the school's outdoor basketball court. [[941 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she arrived half an hour early, the area was already packed with students surrounding the court. [[942 旁白 neutral]]
It was clear how popular the two male leads were at school. [[943 旁白 neutral]]
After pretending to be lost and moving toward Su Tao's direction, a girl in the front row who had a good spot quickly shouted and waved enthusiastically at Chi Xiaocheng, "Xiaocheng, over here!" [[944 曾秀花 happy]]
Curious onlookers followed the sound and their mouths dropped open in surprise. [[945 旁白 neutral]]
Today, Chi Xiaocheng had once again gone out without any makeup. [[946 旁白 neutral]]
Her slender and petite body was wrapped in a beige bear-themed sweatshirt. The soft fabric clung to her delicate curves, and the sleeves were slightly rolled up, revealing a small section of her snow-white wrists, making her look exceptionally dainty. [[947 旁白 neutral]]
She still had the same pigtails from when she met Dongfang Yang, tied with delicate ribbons. The ends of her hair curled naturally, and the pigtails swayed gently behind her, adding a touch of playfulness and liveliness. [[948 旁白 neutral]]
Today, she was the cute girl next door. [[949 旁白 neutral]]
What shocked everyone was, of course, Chi Xiaocheng's beauty. The only one present who could compare to such an adorable little lolita was the commoner campus belle, Su Tao. [[950 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because the girl's shout was too loud, it even drew the attention of the three key people on the court. [[951 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang frowned heavily, his eyes filled with disgust. [[952 旁白 angry]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at her with interest. [[953 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes showed some surprise and complexity. When Chi Xiaocheng smiled at her, she quickly looked away. [[954 旁白 neutral]]
As she did, she noticed a hint of disappointment flash across the little lolita's face. [[955 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng squeezed through to the front and came to the girl who had just called her. [[956 旁白 neutral]]
One of her "friends," Zeng Xiuhua. [[957 旁白 neutral]]
Her nose was high and her makeup was exquisite, but the muscles in her face were stiff when she spoke, a clear sign of plastic surgery. [[958 旁白 neutral]]
"I knew you'd come to watch the game, Xiaocheng. I saved a spot for you." [[959 曾秀花 happy]]
She pulled Chi Xiaocheng to sit beside her, about five meters away from Su Tao's prime location. [[960 旁白 neutral]]
She first glanced at Chi Xiaocheng's makeup-free face, which seemed full of collagen, hiding her jealousy and dissatisfaction deep in her eyes. She asked with concern: [[961 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, why did you come out without makeup? A girl can't go out without makeup. You don't look good like this at all." [[962 曾秀花 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng forced a smile, "I ran out of makeup and have no money to buy more. I washed my face carefully with water before I left, so it's fine." [[963 池小橙 sad]]
"How can that be okay? As a girl, you must dress up!" Zeng Xiuhua said in a disapproving tone. "Honestly, if you ran out of makeup, you should have just told me. Didn't I give you the last set? I have another one, I'll bring it to your dorm later." [[964 曾秀花 angry]]
Looking at that caring expression. [[965 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng almost threw up last night's dinner. [[966 旁白 angry]]
That cheap makeup, like a 30-yuan facial cleanser, had many side effects, didn't look good, and damaged the skin. [[967 旁白 neutral]]
The original owner was so foolish to actually believe her after being told such things a few times. [[968 旁白 angry]]
Although she was complaining internally, Chi Xiaocheng still wore a strained, fake smile. [[969 旁白 neutral]]
This made Su Tao, who was secretly watching, feel very uncomfortable. [[970 旁白 sad]]
The surprise she felt about Chi Xiaocheng's appearance was nothing compared to the impact of the words spoken in the basement a few days ago. [[971 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, she still remembered everything that happened in the basement. [[972 旁白 neutral]]
Including the things Chi Xiaocheng had said. [[973 旁白 neutral]]
That afternoon, Chi Xiaocheng had bitten her, and the pain on her lip was still unforgettable for Su Tao. [[974 旁白 neutral]]
Why? [[975 旁白 neutral]]
Because after being bitten by Chi Xiaocheng, she... got a canker sore. [[976 旁白 sad]]

Chapter 11: Circadian Qi Gathering [[1178 旁白 neutral]]
In front of a skyscraper in the city center. [[1179 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu looked up at the towering skyscraper. It seemed to pierce the clouds, and he could faintly make out a celestial palace shimmering at its top. [[1180 旁白 neutral]]
This was the office building of the Xianyun Group in the center of Songyang City. [[1181 旁白 neutral]]
Beyond it, Zhang Yu could see an even taller building that seemed to connect to the very edge of the sky. He knew it was Songyang City's tallest building, the 999-story Central Tower, a landmark he often saw on his way to and from school. [[1182 旁白 neutral]]
Now, he turned his head back to the office building in front of him. [[1183 旁白 neutral]]
"Xianyun Group, huh?" [[1184 张羽 neutral]]
On his way here, Zhang Yu had already searched online for information about the Xianyun Group. [[1185 旁白 neutral]]
It was a massive corporation under the Myriad Arts Sect, with business in developing and selling cultivation techniques, cultivation education, and creative publishing. [[1186 旁白 neutral]]
The Myriad Arts Sect was one of the Ten Great Sects. In Kunxu, a person's life was inseparable from the Ten Great Sects, from daily necessities to life and death, and this was even more true for cultivation. [[1187 旁白 neutral]]
So, Zhang Yu was not at all surprised that a giant company like Xianyun Group belonged to one of the Ten Great Sects, the Myriad Arts Sect. [[1188 旁白 neutral]]
He lowered his head and entered the building. After explaining his purpose at the front desk, Zhang Yu went through registration, signed a contract, had a simple physical exam, and was finally led to a place that looked like a classroom. [[1189 旁白 neutral]]
He saw that several other students were already seated in the classroom. [[1190 旁白 neutral]]
After waiting for a while, once the number of students in the classroom reached fifteen, a middle-aged man in a sharp suit walked in and began to explain the day's technique trial. [[1191 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello everyone, I am today's instructor." [[1192 指导老师 neutral]]
"All of you here have already signed the contract, but I must remind you that nothing we discuss here today is allowed to be shared. If our company discovers that anyone has leaked information, we will find you, no matter where you run." [[1193 指导老师 angry]]
Hearing these words, the students felt a chill. They knew he wasn't bluffing. With the power of the Xianyun Group and its backer, the Myriad Arts Sect, it wouldn't be difficult. [[1194 旁白 neutral]]
"The technique you will all be trying to learn today is called Experimental Technique No. 113. First, please watch the instructional video..." [[1195 指导老师 neutral]]
According to the short instructional video, this technique was a Qi Refining breathing method. However, unlike the basic breathing method, it was much more complex, like establishing some kind of mana circulation throughout the entire body. [[1196 旁白 neutral]]
After watching the video, most of the students who came for the trial were still completely confused. [[1197 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until the instructor's detailed explanation that the students began to vaguely understand, but it only made their scalps tingle with dread. [[1198 旁白 neutral]]
"No way... they want us to practice this technique? Are we even worthy?" [[1199 陌生男1 sad]]
The technique's mana circulation path was simply too complex and difficult. It was like trying to paint the 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' scroll on a single A4 paper. [[1200 旁白 neutral]]
If Zhang Yu were to describe it, it was as difficult as carving flowers on a piece of crap. [[1201 旁白 neutral]]
Forget about circulating mana according to the instructional path; no one present could even memorize the path. They had already forgotten most of it just after it was explained. [[1202 旁白 neutral]]
Never mind leaking it, the students had absolutely no confidence they could even learn the technique to complete the trial. [[1203 旁白 neutral]]
Seemingly sensing the students' change in mood, the instructor said from the front, "Don't worry, this trial doesn't require you to master this technique." [[1204 指导老师 neutral]]
"In fact, it's impossible for a beginner to master this technique on their own." [[1205 指导老师 neutral]]
"What we are testing this time is an auxiliary device that works with No. 113 to help you execute the technique..." [[1206 指导老师 neutral]]
Next, the students were taken to a testing room where mana-detecting patches were placed on their hands, feet, chest, and back. [[1207 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a series of silver, needle-like objects connected to wires were brought in front of the students by mechanical arms. [[1208 旁白 neutral]]
The instructor continued from the side, "When you begin to circulate your mana, the detection patches will constantly monitor its flow inside your body." [[1209 指导老师 neutral]]
"The Yuan-Magnetic Needles, operated by the mechanical arms, will then stimulate points along your mana circulation path to help you identify and correct the route..." [[1210 指导老师 neutral]]
Zhang Yu listened for a moment and understood. It was basically an auto-pathing system... no, an auto-cultivation system. [[1211 旁白 neutral]]
Because the mana path of Technique No. 113 was so complex, with high requirements for timing and positioning of mana flow, it was necessary to monitor the cultivator's path while using the Yuan-Magnetic Needles to guide them by stimulating various body parts. [[1212 旁白 neutral]]
However, the process was also quite dangerous because the circulation path of Technique No. 113 was so complex. [[1213 旁白 neutral]]
With such a complex circulation path, even a small error in the mana flow would cause it to go out of control, spreading through the body, causing itching, pain, and alternating hot and cold flashes, which could easily lead to a greater loss of control. [[1214 旁白 neutral]]
If it went on for too long, it would cause internal injuries, and the longer it went on, the more severe the injuries would be. [[1215 旁白 neutral]]
Afterward, one would either have to go to the hospital and pay a high price for a powerful cultivator to suppress the runaway mana, rely on their own physical strength to endure it until the mana dissipated on its own, or the cultivator would have to master the technique themselves to actively rein in the stray mana. [[1216 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the instructor continued, "...As stated in the contract you all signed, the payment for this trial will be based on the percentage of the circulation path you complete. Only by completing 100% of the path will you receive the full ten thousand yuan." [[1217 指导老师 neutral]]
"If you only complete half of the mana path, you will only get five thousand." [[1218 指导老师 neutral]]
"Alright everyone, if there are no more questions, please begin." [[1219 指导老师 neutral]]
Zhang Yu glanced at the information that appeared in the Feather Book. [[1220 旁白 neutral]]
Circadian Qi Gathering Method Level 0 (0/1) [[1221 旁白 neutral]]
He thought to himself, "Does this mean I only need to practice it once to succeed?" [[1222 张羽 neutral]]
Zhang Yu closed his eyes and tried to circulate the technique he had just learned, moving his mana from his dantian toward his spine. [[1223 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, he felt a slight sting on his back and knew it was the Yuan-Magnetic Needle guiding his mana. [[1224 旁白 neutral]]
So, he followed the guidance of the Yuan-Magnetic Needles, circulating his mana bit by bit. [[1225 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1226 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, outside the testing room, a group of people was observing the students' situation. [[1227 旁白 neutral]]
"It's starting." [[1228 研究人员 neutral]]
The lead researcher had messy short hair and was staring intently at the constantly changing data on the screen. [[1229 旁白 neutral]]
The screen showed the status of each student's mana circulation after they began practicing Experimental Technique No. 113. [[1230 旁白 neutral]]
An assistant next to him also watched with a grave expression, looking at the circulation diagrams of each student on the screen. These images were created by compiling mana data from all parts of the students' bodies to visualize their internal mana flow. [[1231 旁白 neutral]]
The correct circulation path was green, while parts where the mana deviated were marked in red. [[1232 旁白 neutral]]
As time passed, disappointment filled the assistant's eyes as he watched more and more red error marks appear on the circulation paths. [[1233 旁白 neutral]]
"Teacher, it seems the guidance precision of the Yuan-Magnetic Needles needs to be improved further, or it won't meet the accuracy requirements for beginners practicing No. 113." [[1234 助手 neutral]]
"It's still too difficult for beginners to learn No. 113. Should we recruit a batch of test subjects with higher Dao Hearts?" [[1235 助手 neutral]]
The researcher, addressed as 'Teacher', frowned and said, "Both No. 113 and the Yuan-Magnetic Needles were developed for beginners. I will not change this direction." [[1236 研究人员 angry]]
"Besides, those with higher Dao Hearts have better techniques to learn. The passive breathing effect of No. 113 isn't competitive for them. It's the beginners who need the passive breathing effect more..." [[1237 研究人员 neutral]]
Just then, a student who made a mistake grunted and spat out a large mouthful of blood. [[1238 旁白 neutral]]
'Teacher' said coldly, "Get him out of here quickly. Don't let him disturb the others." [[1239 研究人员 angry]]
But with the appearance of the first student spitting blood, more and more students attempting the technique began to show signs of distress. Some turned blue and couldn't breathe, some screamed in pain and fainted, while others had minor injuries, merely looking pale with pain or itching where their mana was circulating... [[1240 旁白 neutral]]
Watching the students being carried out one by one, 'Teacher's' expression grew uglier. [[1241 旁白 neutral]]
He said with dissatisfaction, "The quality of this batch of students is too poor. Can't you recruit some better ones?" [[1242 研究人员 angry]]
The assistant explained in a low voice, "Teacher, the previous test subjects were too severely injured. No school is willing to cooperate with us anymore." [[1243 助手 sad]]
'Teacher' snorted, a look of displeasure on his face. "They're just a bunch of poor students. If we can successfully improve either No. 113 or the Yuan-Magnetic Needles, think of the huge market for beginners. What does it matter if a few hundred of them die?" [[1244 研究人员 angry]]
Meanwhile, only three students were left in the testing room, still persisting. [[1245 旁白 neutral]]
Two of them were still holding on because they had few errors and very little runaway mana. [[1246 旁白 neutral]]
The third one, a pale-faced student, surprised even 'Teacher'. "This kid has made quite a few mistakes during his circulation. He must be in extreme pain all over his body by now. How is he still holding on?" [[1247 研究人员 neutral]]
The assistant next to him asked, "Teacher, should we stop him?" [[1248 助手 neutral]]
'Teacher' shook his head, a flicker of interest in his eyes. "Since he wants to earn this money so badly, let's give him the chance." [[1249 研究人员 neutral]]
"Besides, for our research, having more data on mistakes made along the complete circulation path is obviously more beneficial." [[1250 研究人员 neutral]]
... [[1251 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the testing room, whenever Zhang Yu wanted to give up, he would feel the chill from the ritual's power and see the countdown timer in his mind. [[1252 旁白 sad]]
"This stupid thing! All it does is nag. Why don't you try it if you're so great?" [[1253 张羽 angry]]
During the circulation, whenever Zhang Yu made a slight mistake, he could feel mana escaping from the path, stimulating every part of his body, making him feel sore and itchy, hot and cold all at once. [[1254 旁白 neutral]]
After finally completing the entire circulation path, he glanced at the Feather Book. "Circadian Qi Gathering Method Level 0 (0/1)" had changed to "Circadian Qi Gathering Method Level 1 (0/20)". He breathed a small sigh of relief. [[1255 旁白 happy]]
Zhang Yu admitted he had taken a gamble, but luckily, this time he won. [[1256 旁白 happy]]
At that moment, memories of practicing this technique hundreds and thousands of times flooded his mind, making him feel as if he had been practicing it for months. [[1257 旁白 neutral]]
In that instant, Zhang Yu felt that if he wanted to, he could use the Circadian Qi Gathering Method to control all the runaway mana in his body and establish a complex mana cycle. [[1258 旁白 neutral]]
However, he didn't do it right away. Instead, he stood up slowly, enduring the soreness and itchiness all over his body. [[1259 旁白 neutral]]
The instructor quickly walked over, also a little surprised. "Hey, are you okay?" [[1260 指导老师 neutral]]
It was the first time he had seen someone with such a high error rate manage to persist until the end. [[1261 旁白 neutral]]
Zhang Yu clutched his stomach and said, "I feel like my insides are on fire, it's itchy and painful. My upper body feels like it's burning, and my lower body feels like it's frozen... It's so uncomfortable." [[1262 张羽 sad]]
The instructor quickly supported him, saying, "Let me take you to the infirmary to get checked out." [[1263 指导老师 neutral]]
"No need!" Zhang Yu suddenly waved his hand. "What I mean is... you need to pay me more." [[1264 张羽 neutral]]
The instructor looked him up and down, noticing Zhang Yu's constant trembling and increasingly pale face. He said, "One thousand yuan, and you sign another contract stating that whatever happens to you next has nothing to do with us." [[1265 指导老师 neutral]]
After some back and forth, the Xianyun Company ended up giving Zhang Yu an extra 3000 yuan, on the condition that the company would not be responsible for any of his injuries from now on. [[1266 旁白 neutral]]
