Chapter 11: An Important Plot Point, the School Basketball Game [[895 旁白 neutral]]
After returning home, Chi Xiaocheng received a message from Chen Qian. [[896 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao is already back at the dorm. She looks a bit pale and distracted." [[897 陈倩 neutral]]
As a spy on the same side, even though she was annoyed with Chi Xiaocheng, she was being blackmailed. So, she was willing to betray Su Tao, who was her friend on the surface. [[898 旁白 neutral]]
Not long after they parted, she sent a message to Chi Xiaocheng to test her, wanting to find out what her true intentions were. [[899 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Chi Xiaocheng quickly typed a reply: "I need you to take very good care of her. For the next few days, find reasons to stay close to her and tell me if she does or thinks anything important." [[900 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "Take very good care of her? Are you serious?" [[901 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Just do as I say." [[902 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao was very innocent. Since Chen Qian hadn't been exposed yet, she was definitely considered a good friend. Living in the same dorm, they would talk about many things. [[903 旁白 neutral]]
After the emotional rollercoaster she had been through, Su Tao didn't dare to talk to Ye Liang and the others, so she needed someone to rely on for a while. [[904 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian was the perfect person for that. [[905 旁白 neutral]]
On one hand, she could act as my spy to get information. On the other hand, she could gain Su Tao's trust. Once Su Tao believed Chen Qian was a true friend... [[906 旁白 neutral]]
At a critical moment. [[907 旁白 neutral]]
*Stab!* [[908 旁白 neutral]]
A devastating backstab would come. [[909 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Chi Xiaocheng could step in and capture the female lead's fragile heart. [[910 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, this was all part of her plan. Next, she needed to deal with the next plot point from the original novel. [[911 旁白 neutral]]
The school basketball game! [[912 旁白 happy]]
Dongfang Yang would lead the Red Team. [[913 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang would lead the Blue Team. [[914 旁白 neutral]]
The two would face off in the finals of the school basketball tournament! [[915 旁白 happy]]
In female-oriented novels, this kind of match was just a way to show how handsome the two male leads were. It also served to involve the female lead, creating the satisfying trope where it seems like the two male leads are competing in a game, but they are actually competing for her. [[916 旁白 neutral]]
Even though her arrival had created a butterfly effect, Su Tao would still undoubtedly go to the game to cheer for both male leads. [[917 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was thinking about how she, as a third party, could interfere with the plot of this game. [[918 旁白 neutral]]
And at the same time, get closer to Su Tao. [[919 旁白 neutral]]
At the very least, she couldn't let Su Tao keep avoiding her. Chi Xiaocheng was now sending messages to Su Tao, but the female lead wasn't replying at all. [[920 旁白 neutral]]
"Just in case, I should draw another skill." [[921 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the System panel. This was another function of the system besides the store. [[922 旁白 neutral]]
Lottery! [[923 旁白 happy]]
100 Emotion Points for one draw. [[924 旁白 neutral]]
1000 Emotion Points for a ten-draw, which guaranteed at least one low-level skill. [[925 旁白 neutral]]
Skills were different from the strange items in the store. Chi Xiaocheng had experienced how powerful the System's skills were. [[926 旁白 neutral]]
Acting (Intermediate), Pain Reduction (Intermediate), Spiked Liquid (Beginner). [[927 旁白 neutral]]
The three skills she currently had, just the intermediate Acting skill alone, had been a huge help to Chi Xiaocheng. [[928 旁白 neutral]]
"Go big or go home!" [[929 池小橙 happy]]
"Draw!" [[930 池小橙 happy]]
After spending another 100 Emotion Points, the System's lottery panel suddenly flashed with a golden light. [[931 旁白 happy]]
"I got a skill?!" [[932 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's face lit up with surprise, "And it's an intermediate skill!" [[933 池小橙 happy]]
But the moment she saw the skill's name, Chi Xiaocheng froze, and her expression turned strange. [[934 旁白 neutral]]
"Is a skill like this really useful for my current situation?" [[935 池小橙 sad]]
Time quickly passed to November 5th, Tuesday. [[936 旁白 neutral]]
The day of the school basketball game. [[937 旁白 neutral]]
To avoid the other male leads who might still be angry, and that group of two-faced friends, Chi Xiaocheng skipped classes for a day. [[938 旁白 neutral]]
But today was the day a small climax of the plot would unfold. [[939 旁白 neutral]]
At 5 PM, the game was scheduled to start. [[940 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng left early and went to the school's outdoor basketball court. [[941 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she arrived half an hour early, the area was already packed with students surrounding the court. [[942 旁白 neutral]]
It was clear how popular the two male leads were at school. [[943 旁白 neutral]]
After pretending to be lost and moving toward Su Tao's direction, a girl in the front row who had a good spot quickly shouted and waved enthusiastically at Chi Xiaocheng, "Xiaocheng, over here!" [[944 曾秀花 happy]]
Curious onlookers followed the sound and their mouths dropped open in surprise. [[945 旁白 neutral]]
Today, Chi Xiaocheng had once again gone out without any makeup. [[946 旁白 neutral]]
Her slender and petite body was wrapped in a beige bear-themed sweatshirt. The soft fabric clung to her delicate curves, and the sleeves were slightly rolled up, revealing a small section of her snow-white wrists, making her look exceptionally dainty. [[947 旁白 neutral]]
She still had the same pigtails from when she met Dongfang Yang, tied with delicate ribbons. The ends of her hair curled naturally, and the pigtails swayed gently behind her, adding a touch of playfulness and liveliness. [[948 旁白 neutral]]
Today, she was the cute girl next door. [[949 旁白 neutral]]
What shocked everyone was, of course, Chi Xiaocheng's beauty. The only one present who could compare to such an adorable little lolita was the commoner campus belle, Su Tao. [[950 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because the girl's shout was too loud, it even drew the attention of the three key people on the court. [[951 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang frowned heavily, his eyes filled with disgust. [[952 旁白 angry]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at her with interest. [[953 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes showed some surprise and complexity. When Chi Xiaocheng smiled at her, she quickly looked away. [[954 旁白 neutral]]
As she did, she noticed a hint of disappointment flash across the little lolita's face. [[955 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng squeezed through to the front and came to the girl who had just called her. [[956 旁白 neutral]]
One of her "friends," Zeng Xiuhua. [[957 旁白 neutral]]
Her nose was high and her makeup was exquisite, but the muscles in her face were stiff when she spoke, a clear sign of plastic surgery. [[958 旁白 neutral]]
"I knew you'd come to watch the game, Xiaocheng. I saved a spot for you." [[959 曾秀花 happy]]
She pulled Chi Xiaocheng to sit beside her, about five meters away from Su Tao's prime location. [[960 旁白 neutral]]
She first glanced at Chi Xiaocheng's makeup-free face, which seemed full of collagen, hiding her jealousy and dissatisfaction deep in her eyes. She asked with concern: [[961 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, why did you come out without makeup? A girl can't go out without makeup. You don't look good like this at all." [[962 曾秀花 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng forced a smile, "I ran out of makeup and have no money to buy more. I washed my face carefully with water before I left, so it's fine." [[963 池小橙 sad]]
"How can that be okay? As a girl, you must dress up!" Zeng Xiuhua said in a disapproving tone. "Honestly, if you ran out of makeup, you should have just told me. Didn't I give you the last set? I have another one, I'll bring it to your dorm later." [[964 曾秀花 angry]]
Looking at that caring expression. [[965 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng almost threw up last night's dinner. [[966 旁白 angry]]
That cheap makeup, like a 30-yuan facial cleanser, had many side effects, didn't look good, and damaged the skin. [[967 旁白 neutral]]
The original owner was so foolish to actually believe her after being told such things a few times. [[968 旁白 angry]]
Although she was complaining internally, Chi Xiaocheng still wore a strained, fake smile. [[969 旁白 neutral]]
This made Su Tao, who was secretly watching, feel very uncomfortable. [[970 旁白 sad]]
The surprise she felt about Chi Xiaocheng's appearance was nothing compared to the impact of the words spoken in the basement a few days ago. [[971 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, she still remembered everything that happened in the basement. [[972 旁白 neutral]]
Including the things Chi Xiaocheng had said. [[973 旁白 neutral]]
That afternoon, Chi Xiaocheng had bitten her, and the pain on her lip was still unforgettable for Su Tao. [[974 旁白 neutral]]
Why? [[975 旁白 neutral]]
Because after being bitten by Chi Xiaocheng, she... got a canker sore. [[976 旁白 sad]]
