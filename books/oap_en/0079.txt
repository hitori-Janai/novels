Chapter 79 You Can't Escape (Thanks to Wudu Suoqiu for the Gift King) [[6908 旁白 neutral]]
Regarding the original owner Xiaocheng's reputation, it was extremely polarized in the original novel. [[6909 旁白 neutral]]
Some readers believed that the original owner deserved to die for all the hateful things she did in the early stages, and that her whitewashing later was purely due to the author's problematic mind. [[6910 旁白 neutral]]
After all, the original author ruined the entire work for money, so it was normal to write some bad stuff at the end. [[6911 旁白 neutral]]
But there were also some readers who were purely Su Tao fans. [[6912 旁白 neutral]]
Undeniably, "From Sidekick to Center Stage: Winning Over the Male Leads" was a bad work. The author ruined the entire book for money. [[6913 旁白 neutral]]
However, in terms of plot coherence, the author's writing skills were still there. [[6914 旁白 neutral]]
But from Su Tao's perspective, she was loved by many in the early stages, confused and pained in the middle, and betrayed one after another in the later stages. [[6915 旁白 neutral]]
If this novel is viewed as Su Tao's tragic life, rather than the author bowing down for money, the resonance and love for Su Tao will only deepen. [[6916 旁白 neutral]]
The character of the original owner Xiaocheng, although she died in the early stages, often appeared in Su Tao's memories, serving as Su Tao's spiritual support, alleviating her pain after being betrayed again and again. [[6917 旁白 neutral]]
—If I die like this, how can I face Xiaocheng in the afterlife? [[6918 苏桃 sad]]
—I killed her, I killed Brother Chi Song. I should bear everything for her, live with regret for the rest of my life, repay her, and fulfill everything she wanted to do before she died. [[6919 苏桃 sad]]
It was precisely because of these descriptions that Su Tao's independent thinking and the original owner Xiaocheng's whitewashing in the final deathbed scene seemed much more normal. [[6920 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she was just a cannon fodder villain, the name "Chi Xiaocheng" ran through the entire 4 million words of the novel with Su Tao. [[6921 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's final despair was only due to a dream she had when she was on her deathbed. [[6922 旁白 neutral]]
It was the inner demon that had plagued her for years. [[6923 旁白 neutral]]
The original owner Xiaocheng, who had already died, appeared in her dream, apologized to her, forgave her, and confessed to her. [[6924 旁白 neutral]]
—Tao Tao, you're not unloved. You still have me. If I could do it all over again, I would, I would definitely fill your surroundings with love. I won't let anyone bully you again! [[6925 池小橙 neutral]]
She woke up from her dream. [[6926 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt that even if she couldn't be forgiven, perhaps after death, she could repay the mistakes she had made to the original owner Xiaocheng in the afterlife. [[6927 旁白 neutral]]
The dripping tears wet the photo she held tightly even in her sleep. [[6928 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hugged the photo tightly. [[6929 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry." [[6930 苏桃 sad]]
It was unclear whether it was Su Tao apologizing to the original owner Xiaocheng. [[6931 旁白 neutral]]
Or the author of the novel apologizing to the vast number of readers. [[6932 旁白 neutral]]
With this last sentence as the ending, Su Tao committed suicide. [[6933 旁白 neutral]]
The novel ended. [[6934 旁白 neutral]]
There were no extra chapters, no epilogues, and no second part to extend this IP for quick money. [[6935 旁白 neutral]]
The author left all suspense as blank space, allowing readers to discuss. [[6936 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's mind replayed the plot she currently knew, bringing the conversation back to the present, "System, that's why I said, Su Tao won't collapse that easily. As long as she still has me in her heart, she will eventually stand up again after confusion." [[6937 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved into a playful smile, "Tao Tao still needs to cure my yandere tendencies and return to how things were before. How could she collapse like this?" [[6938 池小橙 neutral]]
"But I'm not a yandere, so there's no cure. That's a difficult problem to solve." [[6939 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the sleeping Su Tao, already understanding why Su Tao was like this. [[6940 旁白 neutral]]
"She's just avoiding it right now. Because I self-harmed to frame Ye Liang, and used that to tie her to my side, the method was too extreme, it washed away her perception of me, making her afraid of me." [[6941 池小橙 neutral]]
"She's afraid that I'll use the same method to harm others around her, forcing her to make choices again and again, and even harming myself in the process." [[6942 池小橙 neutral]]
"She's afraid to make choices, and she doesn't dare to accept the fact that I'm a yandere. Even though I, as Doctor Cheng, have been constantly guiding her, she still hasn't changed her mind about curing me." [[6943 池小橙 neutral]]
"But that won't do~" [[6944 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the monitoring screen on her phone. Su Tao was sleeping soundly, hugging the panda. After letting go of all her burdens and choosing to escape, even without the sachet by her side, she slept peacefully. [[6945 旁白 neutral]]
Unconsciously, Chi Xiaocheng's gaze towards Su Tao became a little intoxicated, "Tao Tao can't be afraid of me. If she's afraid of me, how can she like me? If she doesn't take the first step, there will never be any progress." [[6946 池小橙 neutral]]
"Even if she's forced, she must actively accept me!" [[6947 池小橙 neutral]]
This was the most important part of Chi Xiaocheng's plan! [[6948 旁白 neutral]]
The date this morning had already shown initial results. She was confident that Su Tao would fall into her gentle trap after a day. [[6949 旁白 neutral]]
To create the thought that "although Xiaocheng is a little yandere, being with her is truly happy and satisfying." [[6950 旁白 neutral]]
And because of this goal. [[6951 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng put pressure on Su Tao every moment during this period. [[6952 旁白 neutral]]
When she gradually couldn't breathe, she would naturally find that Xiaocheng's embrace was the only place where she could relieve stress and relax. [[6953 旁白 neutral]]
To like, to yearn for. [[6954 旁白 neutral]]
Just like in the dark room. [[6955 旁白 neutral]]
Everything was so strange, so eerie and abnormal. [[6956 旁白 neutral]]
Only her cuteness was the sweetness that distinguished her from everything else. [[6957 旁白 neutral]]
Then to pursue, to reach out and grasp, and then to begin to enjoy. [[6958 旁白 neutral]]
But Ye Liang's appearance disrupted all of Chi Xiaocheng's plans and preparations! [[6959 旁白 neutral]]
The gentle path was no longer viable. [[6960 旁白 neutral]]
Tao Tao, if you keep avoiding me like this, when will you ever like me? [[6961 池小橙 sad]]
When will we ever be together? [[6962 池小橙 sad]]
The pressure is not enough. [[6963 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lay on the hospital bed, slowly waiting for time to pass. [[6964 旁白 neutral]]
She dealt with the doctor, and then with Dongfang Yang and her brother, who took time out of their busy schedules to visit her. [[6965 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, who had slept for a full 10 hours from noon to late night, slowly woke up. [[6966 旁白 neutral]]
Long periods of drowsiness did not make her feel refreshed; instead, she felt even more tired and listless in a short period of time. [[6967 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was like this, feeling dizzy and a dull pain in her chest. [[6968 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, even though she still felt tired, she no longer had the struggle and pain she felt before going to sleep. [[6969 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the panda plushie she was still hugging, and said with a smile, "Panda, panda, you're even softer than Xiaocheng." [[6970 苏桃 neutral]]
Saying that, she nudged the panda's belly with her face. [[6971 旁白 neutral]]
But after saying that, Su Tao couldn't help but pause. [[6972 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng. [[6973 旁白 neutral]]
She's still in the hospital. [[6974 旁白 neutral]]
Memories flooded back like a tide. [[6975 旁白 neutral]]
Self-harm, seduction, Ye Liang's betrayal, choice. [[6976 旁白 neutral]]
Scene after scene flashed by, making Su Tao show a pained expression again. [[6977 旁白 neutral]]
But when she looked up again, her expression showed a hint of retreat. [[6978 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps, just let nature take its course? [[6979 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as this thought emerged, the phone in the living room rang. [[6980 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had a bad premonition. [[6981 旁白 neutral]]
She walked out and looked at the caller ID. [[6982 旁白 neutral]]
She breathed a sigh of relief. [[6983 旁白 neutral]]
The call was from Chi Xiaocheng's mother. [[6984 旁白 neutral]]
She really didn't want to face Chi Xiaocheng right now, and she didn't want to think about Chi Xiaocheng's yandere tendencies. [[6985 旁白 neutral]]
This matter seemed to have been hidden deep in her heart. [[6986 旁白 neutral]]
Facing Chi's mother, Su Tao showed a relaxed smile, "Hello, Auntie, good evening." [[6987 苏桃 neutral]]
The call connected. In the hospital, Chi Xiaocheng listened to the voice coming from the phone, and her lips curved. [[6988 旁白 neutral]]
Pseudovoice skill activated. [[6989 旁白 neutral]]
Imitating her mother's old and anxious voice, it slowly sounded in Su Tao's ear, "That's great, Xiao Tao, your call went through." [[6990 池母 neutral]]
"Xiao Tao, isn't Xiaocheng with you? I can't get through to her phone." [[6991 池母 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng... where is she?" [[6992 池母 neutral]]
The old and kind voice in her ear once again evoked beautiful childhood memories. [[6993 旁白 neutral]]
But that beauty now became pressure. [[6994 旁白 neutral]]
Isn't Xiaocheng with you? [[6995 旁白 neutral]]
Didn't you, as her older sister, take good care of her? [[6996 旁白 neutral]]
I entrusted her to you, that's why I let her study in Jiuzhou City with you. [[6997 旁白 neutral]]
Or rather, Xiao Tao, do you... not want her anymore? [[6998 旁白 neutral]]
The suffocating sensation, like being submerged in water, struck again. [[6999 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if Chi Xiaocheng's loving voice echoed in her ear: Tao Tao, you can't escape~ [[7000 池小橙 neutral]]
