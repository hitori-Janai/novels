Chapter 82: The Yandere's Closed Loop (Extra chapter for... I don't know what name to use) [[7148 旁白 neutral]]
"I... I'm a yandere?!" [[7149 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's hand holding the phone was trembling uncontrollably. [[7150 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, a flash of white light lit up the dark window, a bolt of lightning illuminating the entire world, but the delayed thunder never came. [[7151 旁白 neutral]]
That clap of thunder resounded in Su Tao's heart. [[7152 旁白 neutral]]
Before she could say anything, Dr. Cheng's tone suddenly became cheerful, "Of course, I was just kidding. After talking with you for half a month, I know your personality. How could you be a yandere?" [[7153 成医生 neutral]]
"Don't be so nervous." Dr. Cheng continued, her tone no longer as heavy as before. "If what you told me earlier was the truth, you probably already know it yourself, right?" [[7154 成医生 neutral]]
"The reason Miss Chengzi became a yandere, and why you are the object of her yandere tendencies." [[7155 成医生 neutral]]
She didn't even need Dr. Cheng to remind her further. [[7156 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's mind had already followed her train of thought and completed the final piece of the puzzle. [[7157 旁白 neutral]]
Looking back to the afternoon where it all began. [[7158 旁白 neutral]]
That basement, which was confusing, incomprehensible, and something she didn't want to remember. [[7159 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, like a madwoman, had screamed at her in a breakdown. [[7160 旁白 neutral]]
—You always told me that I was your most precious friend, your most important person, the person you liked the most! [[7161 池小橙 angry]]
—Since you told me that, why did you betray me! [[7162 池小橙 angry]]
—Ye Liang, Si Chen, Dongfang Yang, you already have me, why do you still have to like them! [[7163 池小橙 angry]]
—Taotao, isn't having me enough? [[7164 池小橙 sad]]
At that time, Su Tao couldn't understand why Chi Xiaocheng would say such things. [[7165 旁白 neutral]]
She just thought it was the wrong ideas instilled in her by those unfriendly sisters of hers, leading her astray. [[7166 旁白 neutral]]
Recalling it now, with Dr. Cheng's guidance, she gradually understood. [[7167 旁白 neutral]]
The reason Xiaocheng said those things was all because of her! [[7168 苏桃 sad]]
But she was only a few months older than Chi Xiaocheng, so how much more could she possibly understand? [[7169 旁白 neutral]]
The two of them had both been in a state of ignorant confusion. [[7170 旁白 neutral]]
And all along, Su Tao had only seen Chi Xiaocheng as her best friend, a younger sister who lacked security and needed encouragement and care. [[7171 旁白 neutral]]
But she had never looked at her own careless words from Chi Xiaocheng's perspective. [[7172 旁白 neutral]]
Only by clearing the clouds can one see the bright sky. [[7173 旁白 neutral]]
The logic wasn't flawed; the past suspense and entanglement formed a closed loop at this moment. [[7174 旁白 neutral]]
"So it's because of me that Xiaocheng became a yandere." [[7175 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao murmured softly. [[7176 旁白 neutral]]
"And after Xiaocheng became a yandere, I was scared of her, feared her, and even thought about running away and ignoring her completely..." [[7177 苏桃 sad]]
Her thoughts became clear, but her brain began to lack oxygen. [[7178 旁白 neutral]]
A tide of guilt and self-blame flooded Su Tao's heart. [[7179 旁白 neutral]]
Word by word, she uttered, "All this time, I'm the one who has wronged Xiaocheng..." [[7180 苏桃 sad]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, holding the phone and listening to these murmurs, smiled a strange and satisfied smile. [[7181 旁白 neutral]]
She gently reached out and offered a lifeline. [[7182 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Taozi, there's still a chance to save this." [[7183 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao snapped back to her senses and hurriedly asked Dr. Cheng, "Can it really be saved?" [[7184 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng said with a faint smile, her gentle and mature voice reassuring, "We are just helping you sort out your thoughts and recognize the current situation. The topic of whether it can be saved is meant for the end." [[7185 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao asked eagerly, "Then... what should I do?" [[7186 苏桃 neutral]]
But Dr. Cheng didn't interfere further, instead saying slowly, "What you do next is not for me to decide, but depends on your own actions." [[7187 成医生 neutral]]
It's the unknown choices and actions that bring surprises, Taotao. [[7188 池小橙 happy]]
Dr. Cheng: "At the same time, returning to the previous topic, after rejecting the option of sending her to a mental hospital, all you can do now is accept her." [[7189 成医生 neutral]]
"Also, you've already sorted out your own situation. When you face her, will you still be as scared as before?" [[7190 成医生 neutral]]
"I..." Su Tao took a light breath, "It's all my fault that Xiaocheng became like this. I will take responsibility. Even if this hadn't happened, I wouldn't have ignored her." [[7191 苏桃 sad]]
"But Dr. Cheng, do you have other ways to relieve stress and anxiety?" Su Tao pressed, "I must take responsibility, I know that, but Xiaocheng's yandere state still makes my heart pound." [[7192 苏桃 neutral]]
"Regarding your problem, what you actually need is a listener." Dr. Cheng said slowly, "Preferably an online friend like me, a stranger you can talk to." [[7193 成医生 neutral]]
"Of course, a real-life friend is also an option, but it's best if they are trustworthy, and don't let your friend Chengzi know." [[7194 成医生 neutral]]
"Besides that, it's popular now to find various 'buddies'. You could find a buddy with a common hobby, enjoy the hobby together, and chat." [[7195 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao hesitated, "Uh... I don't think I have any hobbies." [[7196 苏桃 neutral]]
"Then find a hobby." Dr. Cheng said, "Watching anime, playing games, or just chatting on a voice call are all fine. Exercise can also relieve stress, but in your case, it would be better to have someone to talk to." [[7197 成医生 neutral]]
"Okay, I'll try." [[7198 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao noted it down very seriously. [[7199 旁白 neutral]]
She asked again, "Then Dr. Cheng, how should I face Xiaocheng? I... have no idea." [[7200 苏桃 neutral]]
"Just act as usual." Dr. Cheng said with a smile, "A yandere is very well-behaved when not provoked, but, I think you can also enjoy it a little." [[7201 成医生 happy]]
"Enjoy?" [[7202 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes, since you can't resist, why not try to enjoy it during the treatment process? Remember what I said?" [[7203 成医生 happy]]
Dr. Cheng's laugh was alluring, "A yandere's love is one of a kind." [[7204 成医生 happy]]
Su Tao said hesitantly, "But... I'm just pretending to like her. To enjoy something like that is really..." [[7205 苏桃 sad]]
"It doesn't conflict with you pretending to like her." Dr. Cheng interrupted Su Tao, "This is a process, but ultimately it depends on you. But you must remember one thing: try to accept the things you hate." [[7206 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao murmured in confusion, "Accept the things I hate?" [[7207 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes." Dr. Cheng nodded, "You are afraid of your friend Chengzi and want to escape. If you don't even try to accept her flaws, to accept your aversion to her, then to her, it's as if no one is on her side." [[7208 成医生 neutral]]
"This is very important for the treatment!" [[7209 成医生 neutral]]
Hearing the word "important" from Dr. Cheng for the first time, Su Tao nodded seriously, "I understand, Dr. Cheng. Thank you for your guidance today!" [[7210 苏桃 happy]]
Dr. Cheng replied, "You're welcome. I told you, as doctors, we often use this method to help patients sort out their thoughts. At most, I can spare some time to chat with you, I can't help you much more." [[7211 成医生 neutral]]
Of course, as a psychologist, while sorting out thoughts. [[7212 旁白 neutral]]
One can also guide thoughts. [[7213 旁白 neutral]]
Oh, Taotao, how can you escape from the palm of my hand? [[7214 池小橙 happy]]
I, Xiaocheng, am so cute, do you really not like me? [[7215 池小橙 happy]]
The call ended. [[7216 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao let out a long breath. After understanding what she needed to do and think, the depression in her heart eased a lot. [[7217 旁白 neutral]]
Recalling Dr. Cheng's words, Su Tao murmured in thought, "Try to accept the things I hate, so that Xiaocheng will be happy..." [[7218 苏桃 neutral]]
She didn't dislike Chi Xiaocheng, she was just a little afraid of her yandere side. So what was there to hate? [[7219 旁白 neutral]]
As she was thinking this, Su Tao suddenly thought of something. [[7220 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly turned her head and looked at the leftover from yesterday [[7221 旁白 neutral]]
Half a bottle of white wine. [[7222 旁白 neutral]]
