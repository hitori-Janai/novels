Chapter 54 Repeated Despair [[4719 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Tao Tao, time to eat!" [[4720 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "You're sick and weak now. How about some soup?" [[4721 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Are you thirsty? Do you want water? Do you need me to feed you?" [[4722 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Or do you want something else to drink?" [[4723 池小橙 neutral]]
Perhaps there was a problem with her taste buds, as all the food tasted strange. [[4724 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes were a little vacant, and she didn't know how much time had passed. Sometimes she felt time passed quickly, and sometimes it was an unbearable torment. [[4725 旁白 neutral]]
Every time she faced Chi Xiaocheng's pathological and strange side, it reminded her of the basement and rooftop scenes. [[4726 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling lost and helpless. [[4727 旁白 neutral]]
She was even more unable to figure out how to cure Chi Xiaocheng's yandere tendencies. [[4728 旁白 neutral]]
Mental exhaustion was, after all, a heavier burden than physical exhaustion. [[4729 旁白 neutral]]
With a "creak," Chi Xiaocheng opened the door and walked in again. [[4730 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't know how much time had passed, so she asked, "Xiaocheng, what time is it now?" [[4731 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked, "I don't know, but Tao Tao, your complexion is very bad. Did you rest well?" [[4732 池小橙 neutral]]
The question was avoided. [[4733 旁白 neutral]]
It was indeed like this. [[4734 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled self-deprecatingly, as if giving up resistance, and lay down on the bed resignedly, "How much longer will this last, Xiaocheng?" [[4735 苏桃 sad]]
"Until you fall in love with me~" [[4736 池小橙 neutral]]
This answer, this conversation, had happened countless times. [[4737 旁白 neutral]]
Saying that, she climbed onto the bed. [[4738 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at Chi Xiaocheng strangely, "What are you going to do this time?" [[4739 苏桃 neutral]]
Every time Chi Xiaocheng came in, she had some purpose, but this time she came empty-handed and did nothing. [[4740 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao's tired and spiritless eyes and said expectantly, "This time, I'm also treating you, Tao Tao. When you accept me and like me, the treatment will stop." [[4741 池小橙 neutral]]
Saying that, she took out a sleeping eye mask from her pocket. [[4742 旁白 neutral]]
She also took out a pair of earplugs that would prevent external disturbances, also for resting. [[4743 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, the world became quiet. [[4744 旁白 neutral]]
The bright light turned off, and the dazzling light in the darkness also disappeared without a trace. [[4745 旁白 neutral]]
Only a faint figure could be seen. [[4746 旁白 neutral]]
Unable to see, unable to hear. [[4747 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao could even hear her own heartbeat. [[4748 旁白 neutral]]
The oppressive heavy breathing was also felt more clearly than usual. [[4749 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lay on the sickbed, weak and frail, unable to do anything. [[4750 旁白 neutral]]
Time passed bit by bit. Su Tao's heart beat faster and faster, her nerves taut. [[4751 旁白 neutral]]
"Ugh—" [[4752 苏桃 sad]]
A signal came from Chi Xiaocheng. [[4753 旁白 neutral]]
Unable to adapt, unwilling to bear. [[4754 旁白 neutral]]
Once... once... once... and again [[4755 旁白 neutral]]
She was cared for as a patient. [[4756 旁白 neutral]]
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate! [[4757 苏桃 angry]]
Why do this, why do this, why do this, why do this, why do this, why do this, why do this! [[4758 苏桃 angry]]
Xiaocheng, what are we, what are we, what are we, what are we, what are we, what are we! [[4759 苏桃 sad]]
Friends, sisters, best friends, friends, sisters, best friends, friends, sisters, best friends! [[4760 苏桃 sad]]
"I like you~" [[4761 池小橙 neutral]]
Suddenly, the earplugs were removed, and a confession filled with deep affection came from her ear. [[4762 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, I like you~" [[4763 池小橙 neutral]]
Again? Just like before. [[4764 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's face became increasingly haggard, and her complexion worsened. [[4765 旁白 neutral]]
The light turned on. [[4766 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stood aside, her smile undiminished. [[4767 旁白 neutral]]
It was still a little lacking. [[4768 旁白 neutral]]
One day had passed. She used her skills to change the taste of all the food Su Tao could access, and the result was this. [[4769 旁白 neutral]]
The continuous high pressure and psychological impact finally caused her to have a huge reaction. [[4770 旁白 neutral]]
Words of concern came from Chi Xiaocheng's mouth, and she gently patted Su Tao's back, actively taking the broom and mop to clean up. [[4771 旁白 neutral]]
Like a gentle, caring wife. [[4772 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took all this in, her expression complex. [[4773 旁白 neutral]]
After finishing, Chi Xiaocheng thoughtfully brought toiletries. [[4774 旁白 neutral]]
Everything was done, and she left without saying a word. [[4775 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving her alone in the room again. [[4776 旁白 neutral]]
Alone. [[4777 旁白 neutral]]
After leaving the room, Chi Xiaocheng stretched. [[4778 旁白 neutral]]
The sky outside was incredibly dark. The rain, which had lasted for a day and a night, finally stopped. [[4779 旁白 neutral]]
Excluding the first night, this was the first night of Su Tao's three-day leave. [[4780 旁白 neutral]]
"From her perspective, at least two or three days have passed, right?" [[4781 池小橙 neutral]]
"But the plan is going smoothly, and there's no one in the way." [[4782 池小橙 neutral]]
In her interpersonal relationships, after a day, everyone was fine except for Si Chen, who asked a few more questions. [[4783 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian was an even more perfect double agent, blocking a large number of classmates and friends who came to look for Su Tao. [[4784 旁白 neutral]]
But because of this, Chi Xiaocheng hadn't slept for almost a day and a night. [[4785 旁白 neutral]]
She finally confirmed Su Tao's condition, ate the last sleep chocolate, and fell into a deep sleep. [[4786 旁白 neutral]]
Six hours passed in the blink of an eye for her. [[4787 旁白 neutral]]
But for Su Tao, it felt like years. [[4788 旁白 neutral]]
She realized that Chi Xiaocheng hadn't come for so long, it might be night, but she couldn't fall asleep no matter what. [[4789 旁白 neutral]]
Her body was tired, her mind exhausted. [[4790 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng left her a piece of bread, but when she bit into it, Su Tao still found it incredibly dry and hard to swallow. [[4791 旁白 neutral]]
Why! [[4792 苏桃 sad]]
Why is it like this! [[4793 苏桃 sad]]
No matter what it is, everything tastes like a mixture of countless flavors, like the most unpalatable thing in the world. Has my sense of taste gone wrong?! [[4794 苏桃 sad]]
Fatigue surged through her, and she finally couldn't bear it, falling into a daze with the lights on. [[4795 旁白 neutral]]
But she felt like she had only slept for a short while when the door opened again. [[4796 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, time to get up~" [[4797 池小橙 neutral]]
Outside, it was two in the morning. [[4798 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng walked into the room with toiletries and a bucket of bath water. [[4799 旁白 neutral]]
After waking Su Tao, she went out again. [[4800 旁白 neutral]]
The pressure from the environment was already sufficient. There was no need for extra words; she would overthink things on her own. [[4801 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao, seeing this bucket of bath water, felt as if she had seen a lifeline. [[4802 旁白 neutral]]
Her tired, dull eyes lit up. [[4803 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what food it was, it tasted strange and hard to swallow. This bath water wasn't food, so it must be... [[4804 旁白 neutral]]
She climbed out of bed and quickly knelt before the bucket, scooping up a ladle of water with both hands. [[4805 旁白 neutral]]
"Gulp~" [[4806 旁白 neutral]]
Water droplets slid from her cheeks down her chin, then gradually flowed to her neck. [[4807 旁白 neutral]]
Silence, despair. [[4808 旁白 neutral]]
The bath water, too... [[4809 旁白 neutral]]
Time continued to pass. [[4810 旁白 neutral]]
Another new cycle. [[4811 旁白 neutral]]
Eating, drinking water, eating fruit, small cakes with cream. [[4812 旁白 neutral]]
Ahhhhhhh! [[4813 苏桃 sad]]
Everything in the world was incredibly unpalatable. Why did such food have a mixture of sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, and salty flavors at the same time?! [[4814 苏桃 sad]]
The pressure exploded, but Su Tao didn't explode with virtue. She only felt like she was going crazy. [[4815 旁白 neutral]]
Eating and vomiting, vomiting and eating. [[4816 旁白 neutral]]
The gnawing pain of an empty stomach was even harder to bear. [[4817 旁白 neutral]]
This is... a yandere! [[4818 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, she couldn't take it anymore. When Chi Xiaocheng brought food again, she grabbed her sleeve and almost pleaded, "Xiaocheng... is there anything else that tastes different? Please... please..." [[4819 苏桃 sad]]
"Yes!" [[4820 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao with a smile, her slender index finger pointing to her pink lips, and whispered, "Didn't Tao Tao notice? This... tastes different~" [[4821 池小橙 neutral]]
