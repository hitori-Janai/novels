Chapter 182: The First Step is to Learn to Like [[15891 旁白 neutral]]
She was sick. [[15892 旁白 neutral]]
And also possessive. [[15893 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't just have a sick, frightening side. [[15894 旁白 neutral]]
She also had a cute, enjoyable side. [[15895 旁白 neutral]]
Yeah, when did I forget her cute side? [[15896 苏桃 neutral]]
Ever since Xiaocheng died... [[15897 苏桃 sad]]
No, even earlier. [[15898 苏桃 neutral]]
She kept asking people around her for answers. [[15899 旁白 neutral]]
But the answers she got were all that she was wrong, that she shouldn't have treated Xiaocheng that way, and she shouldn't have run away and been scared. [[15900 旁白 neutral]]
But she was a normal person. Isn't it normal to be afraid of a scene full of blood? [[15901 苏桃 neutral]]
The constant high pressure, the whispers like evil spirits, and the dream endings that were enough to drive someone mad. [[15902 旁白 neutral]]
It left her breathless and unable to think. [[15903 旁白 neutral]]
Every time she thought about it, it was the scene of Chi Xiaocheng's death. [[15904 旁白 sad]]
It happened in the dream, and it happened in reality too. [[15905 旁白 neutral]]
When she closed her eyes to sleep, she would see those lucid dreams where Xiaocheng was beaten half to death by Ye Liang, resentfully asking why she didn't save her. [[15906 旁白 sad]]
It was like a nightmare, lingering in her heart. [[15907 旁白 sad]]
Unlike Chi Xiaocheng, she didn't know the tragic ending of the original story, and didn't know that her mentor who took care of her was actually using her. [[15908 旁白 neutral]]
The constant pressure just made Su Tao feel that her life was a complete mess. [[15909 旁白 neutral]]
And as the veil was lifted bit by bit, the girl belatedly understood what her yandere was really like. [[15910 旁白 neutral]]
Just as many people had said: no matter how paranoid, no matter the starting point, Chi Xiaocheng always acted for her sake. [[15911 旁白 neutral]]
It was because she felt insecure that she did extreme things. [[15912 旁白 neutral]]
Locking her in the basement was to prevent Ye Liang from hurting her. She was clumsy and didn't know how to express it, so she could only act in such an extreme way. [[15913 旁白 neutral]]
On the rooftop, she almost jumped because of one sentence from her, but a catastrophe was avoided because of her instinctive fear. This showed her care and obedience. [[15914 旁白 neutral]]
Being locked in the dark room was also because she was afraid that being a maid for Ye Liang was like a sheep entering a tiger's den, and she had completely lost her sense of security. The extreme action was to keep her. [[15915 旁白 neutral]]
She once said she wanted her to be obedient, and the half-month of enjoyment was the most stress-free and comfortable time for her. [[15916 旁白 neutral]]
Even when she wanted to end her life, she still left a suicide note. She wanted to go back to a time before they met, so she wouldn't bring her pain. [[15917 旁白 sad]]
The second time in the dark room after waking up, she was already very sick. Sister Long and her mentor were pressuring her, and in her eyes, she was being bullied. Even if the methods were extreme, it was to vent her anger. [[15918 旁白 neutral]]
Even in their final argument, she still restrained herself from becoming morbid, and said with tears in her eyes, "Taotao, I like you." [[15919 旁白 sad]]
A bullet leaves the muzzle at a speed of 900 meters per second. In that extreme situation, she almost subconsciously pushed her away to block the bullet, to protect the one she loved. [[15920 旁白 neutral]]
Did she really not have any likable qualities? [[15921 苏桃 neutral]]
Her smile, her embrace, her warmth, including the sweet "Taotao" she would say when she was feeling affectionate. [[15922 苏桃 happy]]
Holding hands, hugging, shopping, hair clips, cat cafes, and even the enchanting taste of her lips. [[15923 苏桃 happy]]
It's not that she didn't enjoy it, nor that she didn't like it. [[15924 苏桃 neutral]]
It was just the constant pressure that made her unable to think rationally about these wonderful things. [[15925 旁白 neutral]]
She lived all day in guilt, regret, and confusion. [[15926 旁白 sad]]
Instead, she overlooked the most obvious things. [[15927 旁白 neutral]]
The occasional racing of her heart when facing her, wasn't that really attraction? [[15928 苏桃 neutral]]
--When you hold her hand, your eyes are full of her. [[15929 旁白 neutral]]
--As a yandere, she is very obedient and very cute. [[15930 旁白 neutral]]
Don't ignore her cuteness and only look at her sickness. [[15931 旁白 neutral]]
People are always like this, subconsciously ignoring what they already have and blaming the bad things. [[15932 旁白 neutral]]
The one involved is confused, but the onlooker is clear. [[15933 旁白 neutral]]
It was nothing more than that. [[15934 旁白 neutral]]
As an onlooker to Wei Feng's story, Su Tao found it familiar and yet so clear. [[15935 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out and wiped away the fading tears from the corner of her eyes, her tone becoming much more lively, "Thank you." [[15936 苏桃 happy]]
Wei Feng scratched his head and said embarrassedly, "No, no, I also said some things wrong. When you mentioned yandere, I subconsciously thought of a girl. It's not really appropriate to describe your boyfriend as cute." [[15937 韦峰 neutral]]
"If your partner heard me describe her as cute, they might get angry, hahaha!" [[15938 韦峰 happy]]
Wei Feng chugged the last bit of beer in the bottle and praised the taste, "But, you've just been talking about yandere and thinking with your head down. You still haven't said why you want to jump into the river." [[15939 韦峰 neutral]]
Su Tao blinked, "I'm not jumping into the river." [[15940 苏桃 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[15941 韦峰 neutral]]
Wei Feng's hand holding the beer bottle suddenly froze, "So I've been chatting with you for over ten minutes, just giving you a counseling session?" [[15942 韦峰 angry]]
He thought he would have some company on the road to the underworld! [[15943 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled slightly, "I was just a little depressed and came out to clear my head. But after hearing what you said, I think I understand where my problem is." [[15944 苏桃 happy]]
Running away is perhaps the most useless thing to do. [[15945 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning was right to scold her. After Xiaocheng died, she did nothing, and was even depressed all the time. [[15946 旁白 sad]]
If she doesn't change and continues to be this withdrawn, wouldn't she be unworthy of even her memories? [[15947 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao said to Wei Feng, "Why don't you not jump into the river either? If you die just like this, won't you be unable to even remember your girlfriend?" [[15948 苏桃 neutral]]
It would have been better if she hadn't said anything. Now that she did, it was as if a knife had stabbed Wei Feng's heart. [[15949 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao didn't realize that although her experience was similar to Wei Feng's, the points they were struggling with were completely different. [[15950 旁白 neutral]]
The young man turned his head to the side. [[15951 旁白 neutral]]
In the darkness, even with the dim yellow streetlights, it was still impossible to see the other person's face clearly. [[15952 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao could vaguely feel that the other person's eyes were speechless and numb, "Heh, she was taken away by a blondie. Maybe they're in bed right now. What's the use of that kind of memory for me?" [[15953 韦峰 sad]]
"Anyway, I'm an orphan that nobody cares about. I might as well just die." [[15954 韦峰 sad]]
"That's not true." Su Tao said sincerely, holding onto the railing, "I think you're great, and I really appreciate you. Although I don't know your name, I'll still remember you. Thank you for telling me all this." [[15955 苏桃 happy]]
Wei Feng sighed, "I was just talking casually, venting my own emotions." [[15956 韦峰 sad]]
"But I can feel from your tone that love is enjoying and being happy when you're with her." [[15957 苏桃 neutral]]
Wei Feng looked up in Su Tao's direction. In the darkness, he couldn't see the girl's face clearly, but he thought her voice was nice, "Were you also dumped, so you came out to clear your head?" [[15958 韦峰 neutral]]
"I guess so." [[15959 苏桃 sad]]
That kind of final farewell, does it count as me dumping her or her dumping me? [[15960 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps it doesn't count as anything. After all, she never directly faced Chi Xiaocheng's feelings, nor did she ever say a true 'I love you'. [[15961 旁白 sad]]
A "honk" sounded from a distance as a car drove past on the road next to them, and the dim yellow light illuminated the two people by the river. [[15962 旁白 neutral]]
As the snowy wind blew past, Su Tao reached out a hand to hold back her messy gray-black hair. Her pretty face was a bit pale, but at some point, a charming and gentle smile appeared on her lips. [[15963 旁白 happy]]
Wei Feng stood opposite her, staring in a daze. [[15964 旁白 neutral]]
In the last moment of his life, by the river, he met the girl of his dreams. [[15965 旁白 happy]]
The young man's face turned red, and as the car horn faded away, he shouted, "I... My name is Wei Feng! Since we were both dumped, and it's such a coincidence, why don't... why don't we spend the rest of our time together? I'll treat you well!" [[15966 韦峰 happy]]
Love at first sight, it must be like this. [[15967 旁白 happy]]
His confession never needed to wait. [[15968 旁白 neutral]]
After all, the moonlight might only shine on him for a moment. [[15969 旁白 neutral]]
The car's lights drove away, and the girl in front of him became blurry again. [[15970 旁白 neutral]]
Then came the other person's somewhat awkward voice, "Um... I already told you not to jump into the river, don't repay my kindness with malice, okay?" [[15971 苏桃 neutral]]
Wei Feng: "..." [[15972 韦峰 sad]]
I guess I should just jump into the river after all. [[15973 旁白 sad]]
He was a little anxious, "But... didn't your boyfriend already dump you? If he's a jerk, then there's no need to care about him!" [[15974 韦峰 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Sorry, I already like someone, and she's not a jerk." [[15975 苏桃 neutral]]
I don't know if that counts as love. [[15976 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[15977 旁白 neutral]]
At least I can't do nothing. [[15978 旁白 neutral]]
At least I have to change myself. [[15979 旁白 neutral]]
At least I have to make Xiaocheng feel that her death was not completely meaningless. [[15980 旁白 neutral]]
Is love really the enjoyment and happiness of being by her side? [[15981 旁白 neutral]]
I always ignored her cuteness and obsessed over her sickness. [[15982 旁白 sad]]
At least in the future, after she's already gone, I should remember her good qualities, right? [[15983 旁白 neutral]]
The past sickness and pain just need to be hidden in my heart, to cry and regret alone in the middle of the night. [[15984 旁白 sad]]
If I don't take that step, I'll never get the answer. [[15985 旁白 neutral]]
If I don't know what love is, then I'll go find out what love is. [[15986 旁白 neutral]]
But first, I'll tell everyone that I love Xiaocheng! [[15987 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao looked up, her eyes gradually clearing and becoming firm, "Thank you for your earlier compliment. The person I like is really cute. Her name is Xiaocheng... and she's a girl." [[15988 苏桃 happy]]
