Chapter 56 One Finger [[4931 旁白 neutral]]
The tender voice was particularly harsh, like a small beast driven to desperation, frantically displaying aggression. [[4932 旁白 neutral]]
Even though Si Chen was mentally prepared, he was still startled by the voice. [[4933 旁白 neutral]]
He quickly chuckled a few times into the phone, his voice sounding guilty, "Well, that was a joke. I guessed it was you, Chi Xiaocheng. I'm not here for Su Tao this time. I specifically came for you!" [[4934 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen seemed to know how to respond. Before Chi Xiaocheng could have another outburst, he quickly said, "You like Su Tao, right? Su Tao and I have a good relationship. I can be your inside man and help you win over Su Tao. How about it?" [[4935 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's hoarse tone did not diminish, "You two have a good relationship?" [[4936 池小橙 neutral]]
"Uh, cough cough, I mean, a normal friendship. I swear I've never liked Su Tao!" [[4937 司辰 neutral]]
"But you just said you wanted Su Tao to be your girlfriend!" [[4938 池小橙 angry]]
"Oh, that's my alter ego acting up. Why can't I control my mouth?" [[4939 司辰 neutral]]
Along with the voice, there were two crisp slaps. "Regarding Su Tao, how about we talk seriously and rationally?" [[4940 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng considered herself not a yandere, and excellent at emotional control. [[4941 旁白 neutral]]
Reason took over her mind. She sat on the sofa, decided to drop the act, and asked, "What do you mean by teaming up?" [[4942 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen said, "Actually, you know Su Tao's true identity, right?" [[4943 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng paused, then subconsciously asked, "True identity?" [[4944 池小橙 neutral]]
"You don't know?" [[4945 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen's tone also revealed obvious surprise. His risky decision to abandon Su Tao and choose Chi Xiaocheng was something he had considered for a long time. [[4946 旁白 neutral]]
Why did it sound unreliable now? [[4947 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng realized something and quickly said to Si Chen, "Wait a moment." [[4948 池小橙 neutral]]
With that, she quickly opened the system page, "System, I want to see the table of contents of the original novel." [[4949 池小橙 neutral]]
To be honest, Su Tao was a classic tragic female lead from a tomato orphanage background. Chi Xiaocheng couldn't find anything useful from the original owner's memories either. [[4950 旁白 neutral]]
She really didn't know what hidden identity Su Tao had. [[4951 旁白 neutral]]
After searching through the table of contents, she finally found some clues in the chapters between 650 and 700. [[4952 旁白 neutral]]
50 chapters, totaling 250 emotion points. [[4953 旁白 neutral]]
If she could get Si Chen's help with this, it would be a small price to pay for her current situation! [[4954 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng decisively purchased it, and the content of the original novel flooded into her mind like memories. [[4955 旁白 neutral]]
She suddenly understood. [[4956 旁白 neutral]]
This part of the story was also a melodramatic female-oriented plot. [[4957 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao angered Ye Liang because of the divine doctor male lead. Ye Liang, in the book, was set up as a jealous type, so to punish Su Tao, he made her live in his doghouse and bullied her in various ways. [[4958 旁白 neutral]]
After all, with the domineering CEO persona, many female readers liked this kind of popular plot where the pampered little wife is forced into submission. [[4959 旁白 neutral]]
But anyone who writes novels knows that conflict creates interest, and sweetness is just a seasoning. [[4960 旁白 neutral]]
Coincidentally, at this time, Su Tao's true identity was revealed. She was not an orphan, but had a war god father abroad. [[4961 旁白 neutral]]
When the war god father returned and heard that his daughter was living in a doghouse, he unleashed a hundred thousand mercenaries in a fit of rage! [[4962 旁白 neutral]]
The father and the male lead Ye Liang became enemies, and another round of love-hate entanglement and mutual slaughter ensued. [[4963 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's appearance in the plot was rare, but Chi Xiaocheng could infer Si Chen's purpose based on the cause and effect. He wanted to use Su Tao's father's influence to help him regain his position as the Si family heir! [[4964 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, in the eyes of such people, so-called friends are essentially an exchange of interests. [[4965 旁白 neutral]]
But if that's the case... [[4966 旁白 neutral]]
Tao Tao is mine. [[4967 旁白 neutral]]
Her father, who dotes on his daughter, would also be on her side. [[4968 旁白 neutral]]
She also had the system and could read the original novel. Helping Si Chen was not a problem. [[4969 旁白 neutral]]
Adhering to the principle of drawing a big picture first, Chi Xiaocheng picked up her phone and said to Si Chen, "You're talking about Su Tao's father, right? I know." [[4970 池小橙 neutral]]
"You really know!" Si Chen's voice relaxed, "Chi Xiaocheng, you're acting so strangely. I guess you want Su Tao to fall hopelessly in love with you, right? I can help you." [[4971 司辰 neutral]]
"Normally, I can lurk around Su Tao and guide her, helping you win her over. In return, after you win over Su Tao, you'll use her father's influence to help me return to the Si family. How about it?" [[4972 司辰 neutral]]
"This is a good collaboration, isn't it? Her father won't be back in the country for a while. Before that, I'll fully support you. If you think I'm also problematic, you can choose not to help me later, and you won't lose anything!" [[4973 司辰 neutral]]
"Moreover, you're alone against Ye Liang, and it's hard to stand firm. Although my influence isn't great, I can distract some of his energy." [[4974 司辰 neutral]]
It must be said that Si Chen's proposal was hard to refuse. [[4975 旁白 neutral]]
As a rational character who also studied psychology, he had a firm grasp of Chi Xiaocheng's current situation. [[4976 旁白 neutral]]
After saying this, Si Chen began to calculate in his mind. [[4977 旁白 neutral]]
Although Chi Xiaocheng was an uncontrollable yandere, after two interactions, he gradually found a way to control her. [[4978 旁白 neutral]]
That was Su Tao! [[4979 旁白 neutral]]
As long as he kept using Su Tao as an excuse, he could manipulate her rationality and guide her actions. Once he tested her bottom line... [[4980 旁白 neutral]]
Such an irritable lunatic was much easier to control than the intelligent Su Tao. [[4981 旁白 neutral]]
But this thought had barely appeared when he heard Chi Xiaocheng's suspicious voice on the phone, "Are you really going to listen to everything I say?" [[4982 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen pushed up his glasses, a hint of shrewdness flashing in his eyes, "I, Si Chen, always keep my word." [[4983 司辰 neutral]]
"Then... what's the price?" [[4984 池小橙 neutral]]
As Chi Xiaocheng's faint voice sounded, Si Chen was stunned, "What price?" [[4985 司辰 neutral]]
"This transaction is not equal." Chi Xiaocheng's voice seemed to have lost its initial normalcy, "Without you, I can still win over Tao Tao. I like her, and she will only like me!" [[4986 池小橙 angry]]
Si Chen quickly said, "I can also help you restrain Ye Liang, and there's also Dongfang Yang. With me here, I can better help you manage Su Tao's interpersonal relationships and situation. This is already an exchange." [[4987 司辰 neutral]]
"But, I don't like that you said you wanted Tao Tao to be your girlfriend~" [[4988 池小橙 neutral]]
"In the alley, and that call just now, you don't think I've forgotten, do you?" [[4989 池小橙 neutral]]
"She's mine..." [[4990 池小橙 angry]]
"She's mine." [[4991 池小橙 angry]]
"She's mine!!!" [[4992 池小橙 angry]]
"Saying such things, and you want me to trust you?!" [[4993 池小橙 angry]]
Her voice became increasingly cold, and one could even hear a faint, hoarse growl that only small beasts would make. [[4994 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen reached out and touched the side of his face. The scar left in the alley had not yet faded. [[4995 旁白 neutral]]
He thought the matter would be over. [[4996 旁白 neutral]]
He never thought Chi Xiaocheng would still remember it! [[4997 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen closed his eyes and thought for a moment. He let out a long sigh and asked, "Then what do you want me to do? I swear I don't like Su Tao. Saying those words was just to test you for Su Tao. All of this... was instigated by Su Tao!" [[4998 司辰 neutral]]
"I won't allow you to talk about Tao Tao like that!" [[4999 池小橙 angry]]
"She wouldn't do such a thing!" [[5000 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's tone was cold and firm, "It must have been you who misled her!" [[5001 池小橙 angry]]
At these words, Si Chen was so angry that he almost smashed his phone. [[5002 旁白 neutral]]
Yandere, yandere! [[5003 旁白 neutral]]
This is simply impossible to communicate with! [[5004 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, Chi Xiaocheng said coldly, "One finger." [[5005 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen was stunned, not hearing clearly, "What did you say?" [[5006 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice was hoarse, "I want one of your fingers as a gift for apologizing to Tao Tao!" [[5007 池小橙 angry]]
