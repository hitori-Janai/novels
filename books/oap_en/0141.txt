Chapter 141: The Twisted Her, and the Mistaken You (Bonus Chapter) [[12424 旁白 neutral]]
Two days passed, and it was another morning. [[12425 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sat on the sofa, her face weary and numb, her gaze fixed on a small figure busy in the kitchen. [[12426 旁白 neutral]]
She was preparing breakfast. [[12427 旁白 neutral]]
It looked like a complete disaster. [[12428 旁白 neutral]]
In just one day, Su Tao had come to understand what a possessive yandere was truly like. [[12429 旁白 neutral]]
After breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she would always, to some extent, ask her to say "I love you." [[12430 旁白 neutral]]
She said it was proof of their bond. [[12431 旁白 neutral]]
When they watched TV in their free time, Chi Xiaocheng would curl up in her arms, and every time Su Tao looked down, she would meet Chi Xiaocheng's gaze. [[12432 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was watching the movie, while Chi Xiaocheng was watching her. [[12433 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said she'd feel uneasy the moment Su Tao's gaze left her. [[12434 旁白 neutral]]
When Su Tao occasionally spaced out, Chi Xiaocheng would ask what she was thinking, as if afraid she was thinking about someone else, or how to escape. [[12435 旁白 neutral]]
But in reality, this was different from the "dark room" confinement a month ago. [[12436 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao could indeed get her phone. [[12437 旁白 neutral]]
The door wasn't locked. [[12438 旁白 neutral]]
She could move freely around the entire house. Although Chi Xiaocheng watched her most of the time, her eyes weren't on her 24 hours a day. [[12439 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes, Chi Xiaocheng herself would even go out. [[12440 旁白 neutral]]
But was this really freedom? [[12441 旁白 neutral]]
Even with the front door wide open, Su Tao didn't have the courage to run out. [[12442 旁白 sad]]
The last time she left, Chi Xiaocheng had tried to kill herself and was only saved by a stroke of luck. [[12443 旁白 neutral]]
If she left this time, what would she find when she came back? [[12444 旁白 sad]]
Or rather, if she came back, would she even see Xiaocheng again? [[12445 旁白 sad]]
If she went out, Su Tao was afraid something dangerous would happen to Chi Xiaocheng. [[12446 旁白 sad]]
But if she didn't go out, Chi Xiaocheng would hurt herself at home, using it as so-called proof of love. [[12447 旁白 sad]]
She was using her own body to restrain Su Tao's actions! [[12448 旁白 angry]]
Su Tao had no idea how to stop Chi Xiaocheng. [[12449 旁白 sad]]
Now that the disguise of a good girl was torn away, the yandere personality seemed to have become the norm. [[12450 旁白 neutral]]
She curled up slightly, staring blankly as Chi Xiaocheng handed her a bowl of medicinal soup. [[12451 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, it's time for your medicine." [[12452 池小橙 neutral]]
Is this really medicine? [[12453 苏桃 neutral]]
I'm not sick, so why do I have to take it! [[12454 苏桃 angry]]
Am I really sick? [[12455 苏桃 sad]]
Is Xiaocheng the one who's not normal, or is it me? [[12456 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao reached out numbly and took the bowl. [[12457 旁白 neutral]]
The soup was bitter, but her body had gradually gotten used to the taste over the past two days. [[12458 旁白 neutral]]
Or rather, she was forced to accept it as she recalled how Chi Xiaocheng was in her yandere state. [[12459 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao slowly opened her eyes and saw Chi Xiaocheng open her arms to gently hug her. [[12460 旁白 neutral]]
Her cuteness. [[12461 旁白 neutral]]
It quickly washed away the bitterness of the soup. [[12462 旁白 happy]]
"This is a reward for a good girl." [[12463 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's words echoed in her ear again, making Su Tao shrink back. [[12464 旁白 sad]]
She felt like she couldn't hold on much longer. [[12465 旁白 sad]]
Even though nothing was done to her each day, she felt immense pressure. [[12466 旁白 sad]]
After morning, Su Tao got her phone from Chi Xiaocheng. [[12467 旁白 neutral]]
She clung to it like a lifeline, and while Chi Xiaocheng was distracted, she quickly sent a message to Si Chen on WeChat. [[12468 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, Si Chen. [[12469 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng didn't reply, Chengcheng was in seclusion, and Su Tao only had phone numbers for Dr. Chen and Dr. Lin, who she couldn't add on WeChat. [[12470 旁白 neutral]]
Among the few people she could talk to about Chi Xiaocheng, only Si Chen replied. [[12471 旁白 neutral]]
They had already discussed yesterday when she would get her phone. When the time came, Si Chen had already sent a message, "How is Chi Xiaocheng doing now?" [[12472 司辰 neutral]]
After reading the message, Su Tao deleted it and replied, "Xiaocheng is even more strange today than yesterday. I feel like she's watching me even when I'm sleeping at night!" [[12473 苏桃 sad]]
Message sent, then deleted from her side. [[12474 旁白 neutral]]
Then she continued sending, "I really think she's getting sicker. Today she made me drink again, saying I'd tell her I love her when I'm dizzy, but this has been going on for two days!" [[12475 苏桃 sad]]
"What am I supposed to do!" [[12476 苏桃 sad]]
Si Chen: "First, don't panic. Be careful she doesn't notice what you're doing." [[12477 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen: "I've compiled a report based on what you told me yesterday and had Dr. Lin analyze it." [[12478 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Then why did Xiaocheng become like this? Her yandere tendencies are getting worse. What should I do!" [[12479 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao clutched her phone, glanced towards the bedroom, then looked down again. [[12480 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, she no longer hoped to cure Chi Xiaocheng immediately. [[12481 旁白 sad]]
Calming her down and getting her out of her yandere state was more important than anything. [[12482 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen first sent a sighing sticker, then typed a message. [[12483 司辰 neutral]]
"Honestly, Chi Xiaocheng's condition is very bad." [[12484 司辰 sad]]
"Before, she was mostly normal and would only become a yandere when triggered, like when she found out you liked someone, she would turn hostile towards that person." [[12485 司辰 neutral]]
"Dr. Lin suspects that the main cause this time was her suicide attempt two weeks ago." [[12486 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Is it because... that failed attempt scared her?" [[12487 苏桃 sad]]
"Yes," Si Chen said. "She had already written a suicide note and was even ready to give you up so you could live your own life." [[12488 司辰 sad]]
"But in the moment of near-death, the things a person needs and craves most, or rather, the things they care about most, come to the forefront, like the flashbacks people talk about." [[12489 司辰 neutral]]
"Perhaps it was experiencing death that made her this way." [[12490 司辰 neutral]]
"According to Dr. Lin's and my speculation, the main reason for Chi Xiaocheng's behavior is fear." [[12491 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Fear?" [[12492 苏桃 neutral]]
She didn't understand. She was the one who was scared. What did Xiaocheng have to be afraid of when she was like this? [[12493 旁白 neutral]]
However, Si Chen gave her the answer: "There are many possibilities." [[12494 司辰 neutral]]
"She's afraid you'll stop caring about her." [[12495 司辰 sad]]
"Afraid she'll be all alone." [[12496 司辰 sad]]
"Afraid that if you're not by her side, you might get hurt or even die, like what happened at the Binjiang Bridge." [[12497 司辰 sad]]
"Subconsciously, she might believe that you're only safe when you're with her, and she won't be lonely." [[12498 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the words, feeling anxious. "But I've always been by her side, why does she still force me? This is just too abnormal!" [[12499 苏桃 angry]]
Si Chen: "It only seems abnormal to you. Is it possible that her way of thinking has been twisted by that near-death experience?" [[12500 司辰 neutral]]
"Remember when you told me about your reaction on the rooftop? To stop her from being so morbid, you took the initiative to say you liked her." [[12501 司辰 neutral]]
"As a self-preservation instinct, she now believes that only by hurting herself can she make you stay." [[12502 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen: "You and she are both involved, and I am just an observer. None of us can see this from a god-like perspective. Who's to say whether she's wrong or you are?" [[12503 司辰 neutral]]
