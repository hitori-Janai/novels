Chapter 69 Let's Go on a Date~ [[6027 旁白 neutral]]
"Not going!" [[6028 苏桃 angry]]
Two large words appeared heavily on Ye Liang's phone. [[6029 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if Su Tao herself stood before him and slapped him. [[6030 旁白 neutral]]
His face was burning. [[6031 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng... it must be her!" [[6032 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang's face darkened. He subconsciously clutched his waist. He was just a hair's breadth away from having his kidney removed. [[6033 旁白 neutral]]
Although he was lucky to escape, he couldn't understand where Chi Xiaocheng got such strength! [[6034 旁白 neutral]]
If it weren't for her, Su Tao wouldn't be like this now! [[6035 旁白 neutral]]
"Yandere..." [[6036 叶良 neutral]]
At that time, he thought Chi Xiaocheng became a yandere because she liked him. He never expected that, as a girl, she had always liked Su Tao! [[6037 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking this, her actions over the past two months suddenly made sense. [[6038 旁白 neutral]]
Because this guy was already crazy. [[6039 旁白 neutral]]
"Young Master." [[6040 保镖 neutral]]
A bodyguard walked in from outside the door, lowering his head to report, "Something happened. The three sentries sent to watch Chi Xiaocheng's neighborhood were all taken out." [[6041 保镖 neutral]]
"Taken out?" Ye Liang frowned, "Did Chi Xiaocheng not leave the house since I left?" [[6042 叶良 neutral]]
"Yes, Young Master." The bodyguard replied, "You also know that if she went out, it would be fine to abduct her, but forcibly breaking into the community might escalate things." [[6043 保镖 neutral]]
"Who took care of those three sentries?" [[6044 叶良 neutral]]
"Still under investigation. The roadside surveillance cameras were already dealt with beforehand because we also wanted to abduct Chi Xiaocheng, so we haven't found any specific information yet. But their license plates are from Lizhi City." [[6045 保镖 neutral]]
"Lizhi City..." Ye Liang frowned again when he heard these three words, "Is the expansion of our business there not going smoothly either?" [[6046 叶良 neutral]]
"Yes, the local gangs are very resistant, and money can't solve it. If we want to infiltrate, we'll have to use some extraordinary means." [[6047 保镖 neutral]]
"Then how many people can we spare now?" [[6048 叶良 neutral]]
"Uh..." The bodyguard hesitated, then slowly said, "To be honest, we can't spare anyone. The main family in the capital is watching, and there are unknown forces in Lizhi City obstructing us. We need to send more people. We can only spend money to hire some amateurs to try." [[6049 保镖 neutral]]
"What a bunch of useless people!" Ye Liang was furious, "They can't even deal with a college student." [[6050 叶良 angry]]
A college student, logically, shouldn't be a threat. [[6051 旁白 neutral]]
But every time he touched his injuries, Ye Liang couldn't help but get angry. [[6052 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, this guy is better off gone! [[6053 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang picked up his phone and made a call. [[6054 旁白 neutral]]
"A rare guest. Is there something you need from me?" [[6055 司辰 neutral]]
From the other end of the phone, Si Chen's voice came. [[6056 旁白 neutral]]
As one of the "Three Young Masters" of Jiuzhou City, Ye Liang, Si Chen, and Dongfang Yang naturally had connections with each other. [[6057 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang didn't beat around the bush and directly said, "Su Tao has looked for you a few times. You know about Chi Xiaocheng, right?" [[6058 叶良 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Yes, what's wrong?" [[6059 司辰 neutral]]
Ye Liang said seriously, "Chi Xiaocheng is a yandere. She's very dangerous. Letting her stay by Su Tao's side will hurt her!" [[6060 叶良 angry]]
Si Chen, at home, listened to Ye Liang's words, and his expression became strange. [[6061 旁白 neutral]]
It was true that Chi Xiaocheng was a yandere. [[6062 旁白 neutral]]
She would hurt Su Tao? [[6063 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen touched the scar on his face, then felt the weight of the words "Never love Tao" on his back. He sighed and lit a cigarette, "So what do you want from me?" [[6064 司辰 neutral]]
Ye Liang said in a deep voice, "Don't you need money and connections to help you regain your position as the Si family heir? I can help you!" [[6065 叶良 neutral]]
Si Chen raised an eyebrow, "What's the condition?" [[6066 司辰 neutral]]
Ye Liang: "The condition is, you go and get rid of Chi Xiaocheng." [[6067 叶良 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[6068 司辰 surprised]]
Si Chen's mouth twitched continuously. Why did this sentence sound familiar? [[6069 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't help but retort, "You, Ye Liang, control everything in Jiuzhou City, and you can't even deal with a college student. Are you serious asking me?" [[6070 司辰 neutral]]
Ye Liang chuckled, "I'm helping you. Besides me, no one else can help you regain your position as the Si family heir. As you said, Chi Xiaocheng is just a college student. You can easily deal with her." [[6071 叶良 neutral]]
He was confident that Si Chen would agree. [[6072 旁白 neutral]]
He knew this outwardly reserved man with glasses too well. [[6073 旁白 neutral]]
He was very rational, always prioritizing interests and goals. If the benefits were sufficient, this person could even betray friends and family. [[6074 旁白 neutral]]
When I deal with the matters in Lizhi City and free up my hands, helping you regain your position as the Si family heir is my promise, Ye Liang! [[6075 旁白 neutral]]
After dealing with Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao will definitely return to my side, right? [[6076 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, controlling Si Chen, marrying Su Tao, and returning to the Ye family in the capital, from the peak of life to another peak! [[6077 旁白 neutral]]
However, just as he began to fantasize, he heard Si Chen's mocking voice, as if talking to an idiot, "Come on, if I get rid of Chi Xiaocheng, I'll completely break up with Su Tao. What will I do if you stab me in the back? Don't treat me like an idiot." [[6078 司辰 neutral]]
"Click—" [[6079 旁白 neutral]]
"Beep beep beep—" [[6080 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's smile froze. He never thought Si Chen would refuse him. [[6081 旁白 neutral]]
"An uncooperative fellow!" [[6082 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang took a deep breath and made another call. [[6083 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello, Dongfang Yang? Chi Xiaocheng is a yandere. She likes Su Tao. Su Tao is very dangerous. You..." [[6084 叶良 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang: "Haha, Ye Liang, did a donkey kick you in the head? Chi Xiaocheng clearly likes me. Get lost!" [[6085 东方阳 neutral]]
"Beep beep beep—" [[6086 旁白 neutral]]
The call was hung up again. [[6087 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang stood there dumbfounded, only feeling his nose redden. [[6088 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a burst of impotent rage erupted in the office. [[6089 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Su Tao, who had been continuously manipulated by Chen Qian and her roommate, also replied to Chi Xiaocheng's message. [[6090 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't use the cheesy love words Chen Qian prepared, but replied naturally, "Of course I'll save you, Xiaocheng!" [[6091 苏桃 neutral]]
After all, it was an easy question. A little mental pressure was enough. [[6092 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was still huddled in her blanket, her warm fingers typing cold words, "Is it because I'm more important than Ye Liang that you'd save me?" [[6093 池小橙 neutral]]
Peach: "Xiaocheng, why are you still saying such things? Of course you're the most important to me." [[6094 苏桃 neutral]]
Orange: "Hehe, I knew Tao Tao liked me the most. I like Tao Tao the most too." [[6095 池小橙 happy]]
As always, a confession. [[6096 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she had said it many times, Chi Xiaocheng remained tireless. [[6097 旁白 neutral]]
However, after sending this message, Su Tao didn't reply immediately. [[6098 旁白 neutral]]
She still chose to avoid it. [[6099 旁白 neutral]]
But it didn't matter. Chi Xiaocheng knew that Su Tao's mind must be in chaos, otherwise, by this time, she would have replied with some irrelevant words. [[6100 旁白 neutral]]
Three days in the dark room, the harvest was good! [[6101 旁白 neutral]]
Orange: "Tao Tao, I miss you. We haven't seen each other for a long time. Are you free today?" [[6102 池小橙 neutral]]
Peach: "What do you mean a long time? We just met yesterday, okay?" [[6103 苏桃 neutral]]
Not only met, but even slept together in a hug. [[6104 旁白 neutral]]
Orange: "For me, every moment Tao Tao isn't by my side can be described as a year." [[6105 池小橙 neutral]]
Orange: "How about we go out later?" [[6106 池小橙 neutral]]
Peach: "What for?" [[6107 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the message and didn't type a direct reply. [[6108 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she brought her small mouth close to the phone's microphone and clicked on the voice message. [[6109 旁白 neutral]]
"Of course... to go on a date~" [[6110 池小橙 neutral]]
A warm breath exhaled, her voice soft and sweet, like a succubus enticing hearts. [[6111 旁白 neutral]]
