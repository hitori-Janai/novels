Chapter 201: The Opposite of Normal (Bonus chapter for Miiyaaa) [[17603 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die!" [[17604 楚凌风 angry]]
The moment the fruit knife stabbed out, Chu Lingfeng felt the threat of death. [[17605 旁白 neutral]]
He had thought the mastermind was just playing with him. [[17606 旁白 neutral]]
He never imagined that the other person was just trying to lower his guard for a sneak attack! [[17607 旁白 neutral]]
He tried his best to twist his neck away, but how could he match Chi Xiaocheng's speed? [[17608 旁白 neutral]]
It was true that her previous body was weak. [[17609 旁白 neutral]]
But the body she was disguised in wasn't weak at all; it was in a normal, healthy state. [[17610 旁白 neutral]]
On top of that, with the yandere state permanently active, her combat power was tripled. [[17611 旁白 neutral]]
Plus, she had the scalpel skill. [[17612 旁白 neutral]]
When Chi Xiaocheng used the fruit knife, she could even carve a hole in a tree! [[17613 旁白 neutral]]
This attack was meant to be a killing blow. [[17614 旁白 neutral]]
Only then would this male lead not be able to affect Taotao! [[17615 池小橙 angry]]
But it was unclear whether she wasn't used to this disguised body or if she was affected by the cold weather. [[17616 旁白 neutral]]
As the knife thrust out. [[17617 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng felt a sharp, cramping pain in her hand. [[17618 旁白 neutral]]
Her hand trembled slightly, and the knife aiming for his neck slid towards his face instead. [[17619 旁白 neutral]]
Combined with Chu Lingfeng's desperate attempt to dodge. [[17620 旁白 neutral]]
With a "shlick," the knife struck his face, slicing upward at a 45-degree angle. A bloody red line appeared, taking half of his ear with it. [[17621 旁白 neutral]]
The killing blow was interfered with by the heavens. [[17622 旁白 neutral]]
Or rather, Chu Lingfeng's male lead halo was still active, and Chi Xiaocheng simply couldn't kill him directly right now! [[17623 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng's scream, like a pig being slaughtered, reached her ears. [[17624 旁白 neutral]]
"Arrrggghhh—!" [[17625 楚凌风 angry]]
He clutched his ear as gushing blood quickly stained half his face, dripping from his chin to the ground. [[17626 旁白 neutral]]
His face was twisted in a snarl. He reached into his pocket, grabbed a few silver needles, and held them in his hand. "You brought this on yourself!" [[17627 楚凌风 angry]]
The thirty needles that pierced grandma! [[17628 楚凌风 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes widened. [[17629 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing his motion to throw the needles, she also saw the security guards running toward them. [[17630 旁白 neutral]]
She turned and ran. [[17631 旁白 neutral]]
Her small body ducked into the bushes and, out of sight, she turned back into a doll. [[17632 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed she wouldn't be able to kill this guy until she fed him a poison apple. [[17633 池小橙 neutral]]
However… [[17634 池小橙 neutral]]
[The male lead Chu Lingfeng has generated negative emotions such as fear, terror, anger, and pain because of the host] [[17635 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +114…] [[17636 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +514…] [[17637 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +73…] [[17638 系统 neutral]]
All in all, she had made a fortune! [[17639 池小橙 happy]]
But as Chi Xiaocheng left and the security guards arrived, Chu Lingfeng, who had been poised to throw the needles, finally collapsed weakly onto the bench. [[17640 旁白 neutral]]
That was close, he had almost died just now! [[17641 旁白 neutral]]
If he hadn't been lucky and the attacker hadn't somehow missed, he would have lost more than just half an ear. [[17642 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, the reputation of his Taiyi Thirteen Needles was already out there. [[17643 旁白 neutral]]
This person who tried to assassinate him must have believed in his divine needle technique. [[17644 旁白 neutral]]
He pressed a few acupoints to relieve the pain, and when he saw the security captain run over, he immediately cursed, "You useless fools! I sent you a message ages ago, and you're only getting here now!" [[17645 楚凌风 angry]]
The security captain's face was grim. "The birthday banquet has already started. If there's danger, protecting Master Si is the most important thing. How could I gather so many people!" [[17646 保安队长 angry]]
"You dare talk back to me?" [[17647 楚凌风 angry]]
Chu Lingfeng walked over and slapped the security captain across the face. "Can't you see I'm injured? Call an ambulance! The assassin must still be in the courtyard. Find them even if you have to dig three feet into the ground!" [[17648 楚凌风 angry]]
After being slapped, the security captain's face darkened. "Aren't you a divine doctor? Can't you just give yourself a couple of shots? Why call an ambulance!" [[17649 保安队长 angry]]
"You're just a security guard, and you dare to talk back!" Chu Lingfeng raised his hand for another slap, spitting a mouthful of bloody saliva onto the captain's face. [[17650 楚凌风 angry]]
He cursed, "Know your place! You low-class people have no sense. You deserve to be security guards and delivery boys for the rest of your lives. You go to school for a few years just to come out and lick my boots. Don't you know how to seize an opportunity to climb up?" [[17651 楚凌风 angry]]
"And you lot, what are you looking at? Get to work and catch the person!" [[17652 楚凌风 angry]]
"A bunch of useless trash!" [[17653 楚凌风 angry]]
After he finished cursing, he didn't notice the security captain's expression getting darker and darker. [[17654 旁白 neutral]]
Just as he was about to turn, a fist the size of a sandbag slammed into his uninjured right cheek. [[17655 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng was stunned. [[17656 旁白 neutral]]
He looked up. The security captain had already pulled out his baton and rolled up his sleeves. "Who the hell are you cursing at! You're just a dog trying to latch onto the Si family's leg, and you think you're so special." [[17657 保安队长 angry]]
"I'm an orphan with nothing to lose. If I'm going down, I'm taking you with me!" [[17658 保安队长 angry]]
Without another word, the security captain charged forward and started beating Chu Lingfeng. [[17659 旁白 neutral]]
His screams this time were even louder than before. [[17660 旁白 neutral]]
As for Chi Xiaocheng, she had already bought and eaten a speed pill from the System and had long since fled the scene. [[17661 旁白 neutral]]
Although she hadn't managed to kill Chu Lingfeng, she was in a good mood after teaching him a lesson. [[17662 旁白 neutral]]
"But would it be cruel to Taotao if I just disappeared like this?" [[17663 池小橙 neutral]]
"After all, my doll form was a gift to her, a symbol of hope." [[17664 池小橙 neutral]]
"If I disappear, Taotao will definitely worry to death, right?" [[17665 池小橙 neutral]]
With a smile on her lips, Chi Xiaocheng avoided the lights and crowds and quickly arrived outside an open window of the main hall. [[17666 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm kind of looking forward to seeing Taotao's anxious expression~" [[17667 池小橙 happy]]
With a slightly wicked smile, Chi Xiaocheng secretly climbed onto the windowsill. [[17668 旁白 neutral]]
The hall was crowded. An old man stood on a prepared stage, toasting with many people. Even Dongfang Yang was on the stage, chatting and laughing with the old man. [[17669 旁白 neutral]]
The birthday banquet had already begun. The formal speeches were over, and it was time for the guests to mingle. [[17670 旁白 neutral]]
Business collaborations, networking, and even resolving complex business rivalries. [[17671 旁白 neutral]]
This was the main event of the banquet. [[17672 旁白 neutral]]
But... I don't see Taotao in the main hall. [[17673 池小橙 neutral]]
Is she on the dance floor? [[17674 池小橙 neutral]]
Dancing was a natural part of such a banquet, especially for the children of smaller families, who hoped to show off and marry into a better family. [[17675 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng secretly slipped to the other side of the venue and saw Su Tao at a glance. [[17676 旁白 neutral]]
Even in the busy crowd, wearing a purple dress and trying her best to be modest, she was still the most beautiful star. [[17677 旁白 neutral]]
However, the scene was not what Chi Xiaocheng had expected. [[17678 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was not anxiously looking for the doll. [[17679 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she was chatting and laughing with a boy who had slightly long hair, a delicate and androgynous face, and was even shorter than her. [[17680 旁白 neutral]]
This scene made it hard for Chi Xiaocheng to breathe. She had been so sure that Su Tao liked her and would only ever like her. [[17681 池小橙 sad]]
But now. [[17682 池小橙 sad]]
Why aren't you looking for me? [[17683 池小橙 sad]]
Didn't you say you would cherish the things I left behind, just as you cherished me when I was alive? [[17684 池小橙 sad]]
Don't you like me? Why can you smile so happily with someone else? [[17685 池小橙 sad]]
The ribbon at her waist, where the doll had been tied, swayed gently in the breeze. Even without the doll, it looked natural on the long dress. [[17686 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if to say that it didn't matter to her whether the scarecrow doll was there or not. [[17687 旁白 neutral]]
From a distance. [[17688 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng saw the delicate-looking boy extend a hand to Su Tao. [[17689 旁白 neutral]]
He was inviting Su Tao to the dance floor. [[17690 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao took that hand. [[17691 旁白 neutral]]
What does an invitation to dance at a ball represent? [[17692 旁白 neutral]]
The little doll by the window stared blankly at this scene, the light in her eyes gradually fading. [[17693 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, you're being a little naughty." [[17694 池小橙 angry]]
