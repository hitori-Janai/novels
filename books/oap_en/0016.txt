Chapter 16: Her Paranoia [[1384 旁白 neutral]]
Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled as the rain poured down endlessly. [[1385 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the cruise ship, in stark contrast to the harsh weather outside, handsome men and beautiful women mingled happily. [[1386 旁白 neutral]]
By 9 o'clock, all the guests who were supposed to arrive had entered. [[1387 旁白 neutral]]
Making their grand entrance last were, naturally, Su Tao and Ye Liang. [[1388 旁白 neutral]]
As the one who could become the unrequited love of many male leads, and a presence who outshined countless villains and young ladies in the story, Su Tao's beauty was undeniable. [[1389 旁白 neutral]]
She just stood there, her delicate and pretty face looking especially gentle under the lights. [[1390 旁白 neutral]]
Her long white gown clung to her slender waist, perfectly outlining her slim curves. The neckline was slightly open, revealing the elegant curve of her collarbones, and her skin was as smooth as satin, with a faint glow. [[1391 旁白 neutral]]
Her silky black hair fell to her shoulders, and a few loose strands brushed against her ear, making her look exceptionally gentle. [[1392 旁白 neutral]]
She was like a soft moonbeam in the night sky, serene with a hint of mystery, and like a white lotus at dawn, pure and untouched by dust. [[1393 旁白 neutral]]
As for Ye Liang, he looked quite presentable. [[1394 旁白 neutral]]
He seemed to be declaring that Su Tao belonged to him, giving off the aura of a domineering CEO who kept strangers at a distance. [[1395 旁白 neutral]]
However, most people still fixed their gazes on Su Tao. [[1396 旁白 neutral]]
Was she the one from the wild rumors, Young Master Ye's fake girlfriend? [[1397 旁白 neutral]]
Among the many girls present, almost all were pampered young ladies from prominent families. [[1398 旁白 neutral]]
Their looks and figures were naturally not bad, but compared to Su Tao, they all seemed slightly inferior. [[1399 旁白 neutral]]
Some jealous girls soon curled their lips in disdain. "A couple attending a banquet without even linking arms? How fake." [[1400 陌生女1 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang happened to be sipping wine next to this girl and chuckled, "Don't be fooled by Ye Liang's confident look. I bet he hasn't even held Su Tao's hand." [[1401 东方阳 neutral]]
The girl looked at Dongfang Yang curiously. "How do you know?" [[1402 陌生女1 neutral]]
We're rivals, of course I'd know. [[1403 东方阳 neutral]]
Back then, he, Ye Liang, and Si Chen were all competing for her, and none of them could outdo the others. [[1404 东方阳 neutral]]
After all, it was just pursuing a girl; it wasn't worth making the three big families fight. [[1405 东方阳 neutral]]
So they made a pact: no one could force Su Tao. Unless she was willing, they couldn't even touch her, and that included holding hands! [[1406 东方阳 neutral]]
And so, they began a fair competition. [[1407 东方阳 neutral]]
He, Dongfang Yang, was a young master, Ye Liang was a CEO, and Si Chen's status was also high. Each of them had their own pride, thinking that winning over a common girl would be easy, right? [[1408 东方阳 neutral]]
The result was that they held onto that pride. [[1409 东方阳 neutral]]
They pursued Su Tao for three months. [[1410 东方阳 neutral]]
Forget about caressing her cheek or hugging each other. [[1411 东方白 neutral]]
They hadn't even properly held her hand once! [[1412 东方阳 neutral]]
The jealous girl looked at Su Tao, who kept a slight distance from Ye Liang, and sneered, "So what if he's the great Young Master Ye? He's still just a simp." [[1413 陌生女1 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang: "..." [[1414 东方阳 neutral]]
Why do I feel like I just got insulted too? [[1415 东方阳 neutral]]
Just then, another girl in a flowing red dress walked over, holding a wine glass. "Well, well, Young Master Dongfang, drinking all alone? Can't find a date?" [[1416 钱清 neutral]]
Recognizing the newcomer, Dongfang Yang lightly clinked his glass against hers. "Qian Qing, aren't you alone too? I don't lack women, I just can't be bothered to find one." [[1417 东方阳 neutral]]
Qian Qing glanced at Su Tao with an understanding look. "I know all about the pact between you three young masters. But if you ask me, you're all taking it too seriously. You don't have to pursue a girl so directly, you know. There are plenty of other ways to try." [[1418 钱清 neutral]]
"Besides, your family looks down on her, right? To attend a party for her without even bringing a date... that's really lowering your status." [[1419 钱清 neutral]]
After speaking, Qian Qing took a sip of wine and sat down next to Dongfang Yang. [[1420 旁白 neutral]]
But she kept her eyes on Su Tao, her expression still one of annoyance. [[1421 旁白 neutral]]
As for Dongfang Yang, he was actually a little moved. [[1422 旁白 neutral]]
Of course he didn't lack women. With a single word, plenty of beautiful young ladies from wealthy families would want to be with him. [[1423 旁白 neutral]]
He just didn't like those kinds of women. They were only after his money and family influence. [[1424 旁白 neutral]]
Even that foolish and dense Chi Xiaocheng had more character than them. [[1425 旁白 neutral]]
Her looks weren't bad either. [[1426 旁白 neutral]]
She was just a bit short. [[1427 旁白 neutral]]
"Forget it, why am I thinking about her?" [[1428 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang shook his head, looked at Su Tao's back, and downed the wine in his glass. [[1429 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, after dealing with the many people who came up to talk to her, the female lead finally found a moment to sit and relax while Ye Liang was busy chatting with someone else. [[1430 旁白 neutral]]
Although they were only in the socializing stage and the event hadn't officially started, Ye Liang had promised her that she would have a lot of fun later. [[1431 旁白 neutral]]
But this kind of occasion really isn't for me. [[1432 苏桃 neutral]]
Everyone wore a fake smile on their face. [[1433 苏桃 neutral]]
Their eyes were full of calculation. [[1434 苏桃 neutral]]
Their polite conversations sounded elegant yet insincere. [[1435 苏桃 neutral]]
Different people, because of their different statuses, were either arrogant, flattering, or compromising. [[1436 苏桃 neutral]]
She felt like a small boat, just drifting with the current. [[1437 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone to check the time and realized it was already almost 9:30. [[1438 旁白 neutral]]
On her home screen, there was a message from Chi Xiaocheng sent four minutes ago: "Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[1439 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao smiled, recalling the times in elementary and middle school when she and Chi Xiaocheng had relied on each other. [[1440 旁白 happy]]
"When I get back later, I have to have a good talk with Xiaocheng and clear up the recent misunderstandings. Then our relationship can definitely go back to how it was before!" [[1441 苏桃 happy]]
"But I probably won't be back until 11, right?" [[1442 苏桃 neutral]]
She swiped the screen to unlock her phone. [[1443 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she was about to reply to Chi Xiaocheng, she noticed that the red notification dot for Chi Xiaocheng in WeChat showed dozens of messages! [[1444 旁白 neutral]]
What on earth did Xiaocheng send me? [[1445 苏桃 sad]]
Why are there so many? [[1446 苏桃 sad]]
She clicked into the chat and shot up from her seat. [[1447 旁白 neutral]]
In her haste, she knocked over a wine glass next to her. [[1448 旁白 neutral]]
The sharp crash attracted the attention of most of the guests. [[1449 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao's gaze was fixed on her phone, completely oblivious to the outside world. [[1450 旁白 sad]]
She scrolled down the screen. Starting from around 8 o'clock, Chi Xiaocheng had sent the same message every five minutes. [[1451 旁白 sad]]
—Taotao, when are you coming back? [[1452 池小橙 sad]]
Like a prank call from a horror movie, the messages sent a chill down Su Tao's spine. [[1453 旁白 sad]]
The last message was sent at exactly 9:30. [[1454 旁白 sad]]
And the next second, as soon as it turned 9:35, another new message came in. "Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[1455 池小橙 sad]]
For some reason, Su Tao thought of Chi Xiaocheng's strange state in the basement. [[1456 旁白 sad]]
She froze on the spot, her lips feeling a bit dry. [[1457 旁白 sad]]
It wasn't until a voice spoke beside her, "Miss, please lift your foot, be careful not to get hurt." [[1458 陌生男1 neutral]]
A waiter had appeared at her feet at some point and was carefully cleaning up the broken glass. [[1459 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao numbly moved aside and quickly looked back at her phone. [[1460 旁白 sad]]
A thought crossed her mind. [[1461 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe, just maybe, this is an automatic message feature Xiaocheng set up! [[1462 苏桃 neutral]]
But does WeChat even have that feature? [[1463 苏桃 sad]]
She couldn't think of one, but she typed a line with trembling fingers. [[1464 旁白 sad]]
"Xiaocheng, are you okay?" [[1465 苏桃 sad]]
The next second, a message from Chi Xiaocheng arrived. [[1466 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, you finally replied! Of course I'm okay!" [[1467 池小橙 happy]]
"Phew—" [[1468 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe it was just bad reception. [[1469 旁白 neutral]]
"I've been waiting for you. Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[1470 池小橙 happy]]
Forgetting the stray strand of hair that had fallen beside her cheek, she quickly typed, "I won't be back so soon. Xiaocheng, are you still in my dorm? Why don't you go back first? Have some water, get some sleep, and we can talk about everything tomorrow, okay?" [[1471 苏桃 sad]]
Between the lines, she could sense that something was off with Chi Xiaocheng's mood. [[1472 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she was thinking about how to gently probe, she saw another strange reply from Chi Xiaocheng. [[1473 旁白 sad]]
"Drink water? But it's all water here, I can't drink it all." [[1474 池小橙 neutral]]
What does that sentence mean? [[1475 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao didn't understand, but a loud clap of thunder echoed outside, and heavy rain beat against a nearby window. [[1476 旁白 neutral]]
She suddenly thought of a possibility. [[1477 旁白 sad]]
"Xiaocheng, where are you waiting for me?" [[1478 苏桃 sad]]
"The rooftop. Didn't we agree? I'll wait for you on the rooftop at 9 o'clock." [[1479 池小橙 neutral]]
Another string of words, like a death sentence. [[1480 旁白 sad]]
"So, Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[1481 池小橙 sad]]
