Chapter 34 Premonition of Blackening [[2877 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's strength was not great, but it clamped Liu Guijia's arm painfully. [[2878 旁白 neutral]]
Those crimson eyes were like the vertical pupils of a mad cat, instilling fear. [[2879 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia was also startled. She suddenly tightened her grip on Chi Xiaocheng's hair, gritting her teeth and roaring, "What did you say? How dare you talk back to me?!" [[2880 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Don't you know who's in charge here? Say one more word and I'll scratch your face!" [[2881 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Slap—!" [[2882 旁白 neutral]]
Another heavy slap landed on Chi Xiaocheng's face. [[2883 旁白 neutral]]
Her face gradually reddened, and faint crimson lines seeped from the corner of her mouth. Her disheveled hair covered half of her eyes, making Chi Xiaocheng's expression unreadable. [[2884 旁白 neutral]]
After the slap, Liu Guifang's anger, which had arisen from fear of that gaze, gradually dissipated. [[2885 旁白 neutral]]
She sneered, "No matter how much you glare, you're still trash." [[2886 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"I suppose Su Tao is the one who gave you courage, right?" [[2887 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
She snorted coldly, her tone venomous, "She's just like you, a piece of trash. She pretends to be pure, spreading her unbearable stench everywhere, hmph!" [[2888 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"If I couldn't beat her, she'd be a dog just like you and that guy behind me." [[2889 刘桂嘉 angry]]
She spat on the floor, but didn't notice Chi Xiaocheng's face growing increasingly grim. [[2890 旁白 neutral]]
She continued, "She relies on her good looks to seduce others, it's disgusting. But I see she seems to care about you a lot." [[2891 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Saying that, she lifted Chi Xiaocheng's face and hooked her chin, "Tell me, if I use you to threaten Su Tao, what will she do? Will she care about you?" [[2892 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly opened her eyes, a pair of cat-like vertical pupils glowing crimson in the dim room. Her voice was hoarse, "I want to know the answer to that question too..." [[2893 池小橙 neutral]]
"What did you say?" [[2894 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
Liu Guijia frowned. [[2895 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng laughed, crimson lines spilling from the corner of her mouth, flowing down her chin. She no longer maintained the fragile act of being bullied and wronged. [[2896 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she had forgotten her plan. [[2897 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't you want to scratch my face? Why don't you just do it?" [[2898 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng leaned closer, reaching out to clamp Liu Guijia's hand again. The strength came from nowhere. [[2899 旁白 neutral]]
She forcefully pried open Liu Guijia's hand that was pulling her hair. [[2900 旁白 neutral]]
She moved even closer to her, their noses mere millimeters apart. [[2901 旁白 neutral]]
"You... what are you doing?" Liu Guijia was frightened by her gaze and involuntarily took a step back. [[2902 刘桂嘉 sad]]
What kind of eyes were those? [[2903 旁白 neutral]]
The pupils were not human-like, but eerily vertical, glowing with a blood-red light. Just looking into them instilled fear. [[2904 旁白 neutral]]
Like a fierce wolf protecting its cubs. [[2905 旁白 neutral]]
No, that's not right! [[2906 旁白 neutral]]
It was more like the gaze of a small wolf pup fiercely protecting its injured mother. [[2907 旁白 neutral]]
Out of biological instinct. [[2908 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng took another step closer, and the knife in Liu Guijia's hand poked her face. [[2909 旁白 neutral]]
It made a small cut. [[2910 旁白 neutral]]
It bled. [[2911 旁白 neutral]]
It was not the vibrant red that flowed when she was beaten. [[2912 旁白 neutral]]
It was Chi Xiaocheng who actively approached and caused the injury, coupled with those eerie crimson pupils, it was terrifying. [[2913 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng exhaled a warm breath, reaching out to touch the knife, as gently as if caressing a lover, "What, are you scared? Or are you just bluffing?" [[2914 池小橙 neutral]]
"You... don't come any closer!" [[2915 刘桂嘉 sad]]
Liu Guijia suddenly sat on the ground, holding the knife forward with both hands. [[2916 旁白 neutral]]
This was a self-protective posture. [[2917 旁白 neutral]]
She was scared. [[2918 旁白 neutral]]
She even had a feeling that if she really pushed the knife forward, Chi Xiaocheng would actively meet it! [[2919 旁白 neutral]]
There was no fear in this person's eyes. [[2920 旁白 neutral]]
How could this be someone who had been bullied for three years? [[2921 旁白 neutral]]
Aura is a very strange thing, especially when facing the unknown and counter-intuitive situations, the human brain will temporarily enter a self-protection state. [[2922 旁白 neutral]]
Commonly known as... crashing. [[2923 旁白 neutral]]
It's like when a person faces death, everyone knows they should run, but fear permeates their entire body, making them unable to move an inch. [[2924 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia felt that way now. [[2925 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[2926 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like she wanted to... [[2927 旁白 neutral]]
Eat people! [[2928 旁白 neutral]]
The tables had turned. [[2929 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled grimly, "Liu Guijia, you're also someone who bullies the weak and fears the strong. I called you here today specifically to let you bully me. Those slaps and that punch were powerful, I'm very satisfied!" [[2930 池小橙 happy]]
"But!" Chi Xiaocheng took a step forward, "You said something about Tao Tao that made me very unhappy. Although I'm not a yandere, and I don't really like her, she's currently my only reliance for survival." [[2931 池小橙 angry]]
"Conquering the female lead is such a great achievement!" Chi Xiaocheng muttered to herself, her expression gradually becoming excited, "For minor characters and cannon fodder like us, we're only meant to pave the way for the main characters. But do you know, even so, Tao Tao will still shine her light on us minor characters." [[2932 池小橙 happy]]
"It's precisely because she knew what the original owner did was so excessive, yet Su Tao still forgave me and treated me gently. What a wonderful girl she is." [[2933 池小橙 happy]]
"Unlike the person I once loved, who betrayed me even after I gave my all." [[2934 池小橙 sad]]
"You don't know what it feels like to have a hollowed-out heart filled again, do you?" [[2935 池小橙 sad]]
"Bullying the kind-hearted?!" [[2936 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng stood up and suddenly grabbed Liu Guijia's small knife. [[2937 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia frantically tried to pull the knife out, "Let go of me!" [[2938 刘桂嘉 angry]]
The small knife remained motionless, its tip firmly gripped by Chi Xiaocheng. [[2939 旁白 neutral]]
Warm liquid flowed from her palm to her wrist, and Liu Guijia was shocked to find that she couldn't pull the knife back. [[2940 旁白 neutral]]
Doesn't she feel pain? [[2941 旁白 neutral]]
With a "clink," the hilt slipped from her grasp. [[2942 旁白 neutral]]
The small knife was now held reversed in Chi Xiaocheng's hand, and drops of red dripped from its tip, filling the air with a pungent smell. [[2943 旁白 neutral]]
"You don't even dare to make a move?" [[2944 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sneered, lifting the hair from her forehead. The tip of the knife rested on her forehead, just above her eyebrow. [[2945 旁白 neutral]]
"Sizzle—" [[2946 旁白 neutral]]
A vivid red line, dripping with blood, was drawn from above her left eyebrow to her right. [[2947 旁白 neutral]]
The liquid that emerged was like water droplets clinging to glass, sliding over her eyelids and down her cheeks. [[2948 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Chi Xiaocheng's face was radiant and terrifying. [[2949 旁白 neutral]]
Her strange vertical pupils reflected a vivid red color, and a bizarre smile played on her lips, "If you don't make a move, how will others know I was bullied when they arrive?" [[2950 池小橙 neutral]]
"As for you!" Chi Xiaocheng took a large stride forward and straddled Liu Guijia's legs, looking down at her, "It's fine that you hit me, but why did you say so much? Are you venting your emotions as a victor?" [[2951 池小橙 angry]]
She played with the small knife in her hand, and the crimson drops fell onto Liu Guijia's skin, burning hot. [[2952 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said leisurely, "Actually, I think one thing you said was quite right. I also really want to know what kind of reaction Tao Tao would have if I used my life as a threat." [[2953 池小橙 neutral]]
But there's one thing I think is wrong. [[2954 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes suddenly sharpened, "You said you wanted to train Tao Tao into a dog?" [[2955 池小橙 angry]]
"Don't you know, she's mine!" [[2956 池小橙 angry]]
"Even if she turns into a dog, she's still mine!" [[2957 池小橙 angry]]
In this world, only the female lead can protect me from the other male leads and allow me to survive. [[2958 旁白 neutral]]
This is a destiny that must be changed, the fate of a villainous cannon fodder! [[2959 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey, you, close the window. I'm afraid she'll scream too loudly later." [[2960 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked coldly at the disheveled, gloomy-faced follower. [[2961 旁白 neutral]]
Then she stuck out her tongue and licked the blade, "How about you try the taste of hitting me just now?" [[2962 池小橙 neutral]]
