Chapter 226: Selective Amnesia [[19507 旁白 neutral]]
This reality might have been cruel for Su Tao, but Doctor Lin had to say it. [[19508 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's idea was right; she had to face this process to find the courage to deal with Chi Xiaocheng's confused memories. [[19509 旁白 neutral]]
The person who causes a problem is the one who must solve it. If Su Tao didn't dare to face this, recovering Chi Xiaocheng's memories would become incredibly difficult. [[19510 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Lin continued, "For now, we can think of Miss Chi's memories before and after she woke up as a kind of game. Miss Chi is the character to win over, and you, Miss Su Tao, are the main character." [[19511 林医生 neutral]]
"Before Miss Chi's supposed death, her affection for you was undoubtedly high. Even if it wasn't a perfect score, it must have been around 80 or 90. After all, she was willing to die for you." [[19512 林医生 neutral]]
"However, perhaps due to her injuries, while Miss Chi was unconscious, she couldn't accept the reality that she had died and left you forever. When she was briefly conscious, she might have thought of you, but mostly in a painful way." [[19513 林医生 neutral]]
Su Tao found Doctor Lin's words hard to accept. [[19514 旁白 sad]]
She anxiously interrupted him, "Why only the painful memories? At the end... when I thought Xiaocheng was really going to die..." [[19515 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng said she was happy at that moment because I was safe. She had protected me." [[19516 苏桃 sad]]
"Even though I shut myself away for a long time and made many mistakes afterward, she was happy when she got shot!" [[19517 苏桃 sad]]
"And before that, aside from a few bad things, Xiaocheng and I had so many happy moments together!" [[19518 苏桃 happy]]
Her smooth, silky hair was a bit messy. She usually wore it in a stylish, high ponytail, but she wasn't in the mood to fix it, so she had just tied it back carelessly. [[19519 旁白 neutral]]
She was still beautiful, of course. [[19520 旁白 neutral]]
But her 'white moonlight' aura and overall image lacked a certain stunning quality. [[19521 旁白 neutral]]
Her anxiety was clear on her face. [[19522 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Lin chose his words carefully and said, "Psychologically, humans naturally seek meaning in life. Remembering happy moments reinforces the belief that 'my life is worthwhile,' which can reduce fear and suffering at the end of life." [[19523 林医生 neutral]]
"And because of the instinctive need for 'love' and 'belonging,' even if Miss Chi had hated you, when she was truly facing death..." [[19524 林医生 neutral]]
"As long as she cared about you, she would certainly recall good things. She wouldn't want to die with regrets. The 'life flashing before your eyes' phenomenon is the same idea." [[19525 林医生 neutral]]
"As for why she remembers the painful things instead of the happy ones, the simplest reason is probably that the happy memories couldn't outweigh the pain she felt at that time." [[19526 林医生 neutral]]
His words were sad, and they left Su Tao feeling completely drained. [[19527 旁白 sad]]
She slumped into the chair, her mind filled with Doctor Lin's last sentence. [[19528 旁白 sad]]
The painful memories outweighed the happy ones. [[19529 旁白 sad]]
Thinking back over the past few months, wasn't that exactly right? [[19530 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng had pursued her, confessed to her, and gotten hurt because of her, leading to all sorts of negative emotions. [[19531 旁白 sad]]
And what was the response she got in return? [[19532 旁白 sad]]
Avoidance, fear, and rejection. Even at the moment of death, she didn't get the answer she wanted. [[19533 旁白 sad]]
Could that really be called happiness? [[19534 旁白 sad]]
Were the happy smiles she showed every day genuine, or were they just a forced performance so I wouldn't worry? [[19535 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao couldn't figure it out, but she began to understand what Doctor Lin meant. [[19536 旁白 neutral]]
There was a pattern to it. [[19537 旁白 neutral]]
From beginning to end, the root cause was Su Tao herself! [[19538 旁白 sad]]
Everyone looked at Su Tao, waiting for her to come back to her senses. [[19539 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Lin asked softly, "Should I continue?" [[19540 林医生 neutral]]
Su Tao took a deep breath, her eyes looking even more tired. "Doctor Lin, please continue." [[19541 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Lin nodded. "The change in affection is the biggest one. The next is the various memories that have been filled in." [[19542 林医生 neutral]]
"Based on what Doctor Chen and I know about her life, we've tentatively confirmed that in her memories of the past few months, you, Miss Su Tao, have a strong presence but appear very rarely." [[19543 林医生 neutral]]
"Instead, the character of Ye Liang is used to connect the fragments of your memories together." [[19544 林医生 neutral]]
"And before all this, the fact that Miss Chi cared about you, Miss Su Tao, hasn't actually changed. Considering her past experiences, it means that even if she fought with you, she never truly disliked you." [[19545 林医生 neutral]]
Hearing this, a glimmer of light appeared in Su Tao's tired eyes. "She didn't dislike me?" [[19546 苏桃 happy]]
Dongfang Yang added, "But Su Tao, you said that in the hospital room, Chi Xiaocheng clearly told you she didn't like you." [[19547 东方阳 neutral]]
Doctor Lin replied, "When people are arguing, especially when their relationship is getting worse, they probably wouldn't say they like each other, right?" [[19548 林医生 neutral]]
His words made Su Tao remember that at the very beginning, Chi Xiaocheng hadn't been so cold. [[19549 旁白 neutral]]
She would even call her 'Sister Su Tao'. [[19550 旁白 neutral]]
When did the change start? [[19551 旁白 neutral]]
Was it when I started saying things that were strange to her? [[19552 苏桃 sad]]
Or was it the confession? [[19553 苏桃 sad]]
But no matter what, her "dislike" was definitely not "hatred"! [[19554 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao said firmly, "Doctor Lin, please continue!" [[19555 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Lin nodded. "First, I'll describe what might have happened in her memory." [[19556 林医生 neutral]]
"The timeline likely starts after your fight in high school and continues into university. Your relationship with Ye Liang got better and better, and you grew distant from Miss Chi because of him. You attended his parties and always blamed Miss Chi because of him." [[19557 林医生 neutral]]
"In her mind, your state was 'Ye Liang > Xiaocheng'. Miss Chi kept trying to win you back, but you found her more and more annoying and thought she was being unreasonable." [[19558 林医生 neutral]]
"And you two never had a public conversation. You were always busy with other things and ignored her, and eventually, you even cut off the relationship completely." [[19559 林医生 neutral]]
Doctor Lin added, "Of course, that last part about cutting off the relationship is a guess from Doctor Chen and me. We don't know if it actually went that far." [[19560 林医生 neutral]]
"The final trigger for the change was likely when Ye Liang got angry and tried to kill Miss Chi. She barely escaped and wanted your support as her sister, but you still sided with Ye Liang and gave her a cold look." [[19561 林医生 neutral]]
"—In her memory, you completely became someone who hates her." [[19562 林医生 sad]]
As Doctor Lin spoke, he looked at Dongfang Yang and Si Chen. "On the other hand, for you two gentlemen, some memories related to Miss Su Tao were deleted and replaced with you both being like older brothers who stood by her side." [[19563 林医生 neutral]]
Doctor Lin took a deep breath. "Miss Chi's condition can also be defined as selective amnesia. She forgot the painful things, and her brain automatically filled in the gaps." [[19564 林医生 neutral]]
Every single word burned into Su Tao's heart. [[19565 旁白 sad]]
She had a faint feeling that what Doctor Lin was saying sounded vaguely familiar. [[19566 旁白 neutral]]
