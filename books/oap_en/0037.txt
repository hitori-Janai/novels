Chapter 37 Dispelling Doubts [[3147 旁白 neutral]]
However, this might also be because his understanding was not comprehensive enough. [[3148 旁白 neutral]]
After all, Dongfang Yang had indeed changed his opinion of Chi Xiaocheng quite a bit, and he didn't believe that this stupid, clumsy, and cowardly person he saw was faking it. [[3149 旁白 neutral]]
He paid more attention to details. [[3150 旁白 neutral]]
Coincidentally, some details didn't make sense. [[3151 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, there were two knocks on the door of the monitoring room. [[3152 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked back and saw Su Tao, wearing an apron to cover the crimson stains, walk in, "How is it?" [[3153 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang stepped aside, pointing to the monitor, "The cause was Chi Xiaocheng asking that blonde girl for money. The blonde girl's hostility was quite obvious, but Chi Xiaocheng was too timid and still let the other party into the house." [[3154 东方阳 neutral]]
The result, needless to say. [[3155 旁白 neutral]]
The monitor couldn't record the sounds inside the house, but occasionally, one or two laughs could be heard. [[3156 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, what do you think?" [[3157 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang pulled up a chair and sat down to think. [[3158 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suppressed a hint of anger in her eyes, then let out a long sigh and said, "Xiaocheng probably wanted to pay you back, that's why she asked Liu Guijia for money. But I didn't know Xiaocheng borrowed so much from her!" [[3159 苏桃 sad]]
That was seven thousand! [[3160 旁白 neutral]]
Over three years, it might not seem like much, but Chi Xiaocheng's family was poor, and her current frailty was due to early malnutrition. [[3161 旁白 neutral]]
But who knew, Dongfang Yang wasn't concerned about that. "I mean, what do you think of Chi Xiaocheng's contrast?" [[3162 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment, "What do you mean?" [[3163 苏桃 neutral]]
"I won't beat around the bush." Dongfang Yang adjusted the monitor, pausing at the scene where Chi Xiaocheng timidly shrank her neck and entered the door with Liu Guijia and her follower. [[3164 东方阳 neutral]]
He said, "We previously learned that Chi Xiaocheng was willing to risk her life for you, and even showed hostility towards Ye Liang, and for a while, even towards me. But after interacting with her, you and I both know she's so weak. So, where did she get the courage to confront Ye Liang? Who gave it to her?" [[3165 东方阳 neutral]]
"You know, if you hadn't stopped Ye Liang in the basement last time, Chi Xiaocheng would probably have been in trouble, right?" [[3166 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao lowered her head, as if thinking, and nodded slightly. [[3167 旁白 neutral]]
Her information was different from Dongfang Yang's. [[3168 旁白 neutral]]
She knew very well. [[3169 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's courage came from her! [[3170 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng is a yandere. When it comes to herself, she becomes impulsive and irrational. Perhaps it's because of this that she dared to confront Ye Liang, even disregarding his status. [[3171 旁白 neutral]]
But here with Liu Guijia... [[3172 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang continued, "There's another very important question. Although I've been considerate of your feelings and haven't asked, I still can't understand how Chi Xiaocheng kidnapped you. You could easily subdue her with one hand, right?" [[3173 东方阳 neutral]]
"Uh..." [[3174 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao lowered her head and remained silent for a moment. [[3175 旁白 neutral]]
"As for the kidnapping, that's my fault." Su Tao sighed, explaining the situation at the time, "Didn't I owe Ye Liang a favor from last time? He insisted I go to a banquet with him. I thought it was just to show my face and have a meal, so I agreed." [[3176 苏桃 neutral]]
"After that, Xiaocheng found me and said she knew she had been wrong before and wanted to reconcile with me." [[3177 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang nodded, "And then?" [[3178 东方阳 neutral]]
"Then she said that as an apology, she even bought me coffee." Su Tao sighed, "I didn't think much of it at the time and listened to her. I don't know what happened after I drank it." [[3179 苏桃 neutral]]
"When I woke up, I was already locked in the basement." [[3180 苏桃 neutral]]
Strands of hair fell from her temples, sliding down her cheeks. [[3181 旁白 neutral]]
Because she was looking down, a few bangs covered her eyes, making her expression unreadable. [[3182 旁白 neutral]]
The sunlight reflecting on her from outside the window gradually faded. [[3183 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao continued, "As for the courage you mentioned, Dongfang Yang, to confront Ye Liang, it should have been given by me..." [[3184 苏桃 neutral]]
"You?" [[3185 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was a little surprised. This was something he had never considered. [[3186 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes." Su Tao put her hands behind her back, looked up, and smiled helplessly and indulgently, "She's done a lot of things these past two months, but I've never blamed her. Haven't I been trying to persuade both you and Ye Liang?" [[3187 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang paused, as if recalling something. [[3188 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, whenever he used to dislike Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao would always try to mediate. [[3189 旁白 neutral]]
"So that's it..." [[3190 东方阳 neutral]]
He murmured, and the doubts in his heart gradually unraveled. [[3191 旁白 neutral]]
It was her tolerance that gave Chi Xiaocheng courage. [[3192 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Su Tao again, "Then about her being bullied..." [[3193 东方阳 neutral]]
At this, Su Tao clenched her fists. [[3194 旁白 neutral]]
Anger flashed in her eyes. [[3195 旁白 neutral]]
She stared intently at Liu Guijia on the monitor, "I know that blonde girl. She was a bad girl in high school, her grades were terrible, and she bullied the weak everywhere to feel important." [[3196 苏桃 angry]]
"Before, she also bullied Xiaocheng, but after I beat her twice, she got scared." [[3197 苏桃 neutral]]
"After that, she never appeared in front of me again." [[3198 苏桃 neutral]]
"I originally thought she had settled down, but now it seems she's been retaliating against Xiaocheng behind my back for a long time!" [[3199 苏桃 angry]]
"And I knew nothing about any of this." [[3200 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's voice gradually became remorseful, "Before, Xiaocheng would occasionally have scrapes when she came home. She was always clumsy, so she said she fell, and I didn't think much of it." [[3201 苏桃 sad]]
"She would smile foolishly and tell me not to worry. At the time, I just thought she was very sensible and truly good." [[3202 苏桃 sad]]
"Now it seems those injuries were from being bullied." [[3203 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang took a deep breath, "Then why didn't she ever tell you? That blonde girl said seven thousand over three years, meaning she was bullied for three years?" [[3204 东方阳 neutral]]
"She probably didn't want to implicate me?" [[3205 苏桃 sad]]
Afraid of getting hurt herself, afraid of being bullied like her, so she hid whatever harm she suffered, and came home smiling foolishly, saying—I'm fine, don't worry. [[3206 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking back carefully, all she showed him was a smile! [[3207 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at Dongfang Yang, who was still surprised, hesitated for a moment, and then said softly, "Also, perhaps because of these things I didn't know about, Xiaocheng developed some psychological issues. Then, being misled again, led to what happened these past two months." [[3208 苏桃 sad]]
At these words, Dongfang Yang suddenly understood. [[3209 旁白 neutral]]
Everything made sense now. [[3210 旁白 neutral]]
No wonder he felt that Chi Xiaocheng's personality had changed so drastically. It turned out there were so many hidden reasons he didn't know about. [[3211 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of the large pool of crimson on the floor when he first entered the room, Dongfang Yang sighed inwardly. [[3212 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed he had misunderstood Chi Xiaocheng. [[3213 旁白 neutral]]
The faint lingering suspicion immediately vanished. [[3214 旁白 neutral]]
He should try to persuade Ye Liang. Chi Xiaocheng was also a pitiful person. [[3215 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang saw that Su Tao was a little down and comforted her, "Although the process was a bit convoluted, the outcome is good, isn't it?" [[3216 东方阳 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng isn't like she was two months ago, she's become normal, hasn't she?" [[3217 东方阳 neutral]]
Reconciled with Su Tao. [[3218 旁白 neutral]]
Reconciled with himself too. [[3219 旁白 neutral]]
The only one left was Ye Liang, right? [[3220 旁白 neutral]]
But hearing these words, Su Tao felt a pang in her heart, "Yes, she's become... normal." [[3221 苏桃 sad]]
Her smile was forced, and her eyes revealed a hint of unease. [[3222 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's not talk about this anymore." Dongfang Yang said, "Regarding those who bullied Chi Xiaocheng, how do you want to deal with them? Or should I do it? I'll investigate them thoroughly and make them disappear." [[3223 东方阳 neutral]]
The swift and decisive methods of a powerful family. [[3224 旁白 neutral]]
It was too easy to send a few people to Siberia to plant potatoes. [[3225 旁白 neutral]]
However, Su Tao shook her head. [[3226 旁白 neutral]]
The anger in her eyes was no longer suppressed, "Dongfang Yang, you've already helped me a lot, so I won't trouble you. They dared to treat Xiaocheng like this, I want to teach them a lesson myself!" [[3227 苏桃 angry]]
Thinking of Chi Xiaocheng's sobbing cries when she was afraid of losing her, Su Tao involuntarily clenched her fists. [[3228 旁白 neutral]]
No one can bully my Xiaocheng! [[3229 苏桃 angry]]
