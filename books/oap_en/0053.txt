Chapter 53 You Must Receive Treatment Properly~ [[4633 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since she drew this soft candy that could make her skin more delicate, Chi Xiaocheng hadn't eaten it. [[4634 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to save it for Su Tao, at a certain point in time, to make her even more perfect. [[4635 旁白 neutral]]
"Plans can't keep up with changes." [[4636 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng threw the candy into her mouth, then picked up a mirror from the counter. [[4637 旁白 neutral]]
The change was instantaneous. Under the warm light, her skin seemed to glow even more. [[4638 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out and touched her arm. [[4639 旁白 neutral]]
Silky, tender, fair, delicate. [[4640 旁白 neutral]]
Any photo she took would probably be mistaken for having a beauty filter. [[4641 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng then reached out and touched her lips. She felt no change from the sensation on her fingertips. [[4642 旁白 neutral]]
"But all of this, let Tao Tao experience it~" [[4643 池小橙 neutral]]
"To make you like me more, I'm willing to become more perfect." [[4644 池小橙 neutral]]
The eerie glow in Chi Xiaocheng's pupils flashed and disappeared. She looked down at the time; only five minutes had passed. [[4645 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, isn't there a guest room next door with a private bathroom? Wouldn't that room be better? Now it's troublesome for the female lead Su Tao to take a bath, and it's troublesome for you too. Isn't this putting the cart before the horse?] [[4646 系统 neutral]]
"A private bathroom won't do." Since Chi Xiaocheng was doing this, she naturally had her own plans. [[4647 池小橙 neutral]]
So she patiently explained to the system, "In my plan, Tao Tao can't be allowed to touch water I haven't touched alone. And although my room has been cleaned, the layout hasn't changed, which can perfectly evoke her beautiful memories." [[4648 池小橙 neutral]]
"The process of learning is the growth of knowledge. I've transformed from a clumsy idiot who scored zero to an extremist who scores sixty. Only when she realizes I can no longer be a clumsy idiot will she accept my current growth." [[4649 池小橙 neutral]]
"When she is willing to actively teach me, the plan will be half successful." [[4650 池小橙 neutral]]
[This... is this only half?] [[4651 系统 neutral]]
"Otherwise?" Chi Xiaocheng's eyes were deep, and her tone was excited, "I love her wholeheartedly, and she should love me wholeheartedly too!" [[4652 池小橙 happy]]
With that, Chi Xiaocheng looked at the time again. [[4653 旁白 neutral]]
Fifteen minutes had passed. [[4654 旁白 neutral]]
Half an hour was given for bathing. [[4655 旁白 neutral]]
She got up and walked over to knock on the door, "Tao Tao, half an hour is up. I'm coming in~" [[4656 池小橙 neutral]]
"Wait!" [[4657 苏桃 sad]]
Through the crack in the door, she could hear the rustling sound of clothes being put on. [[4658 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, a hesitant voice came from inside, "O-okay..." [[4659 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved upwards as she opened the door. [[4660 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao wearing a bear T-shirt, she couldn't help but smile foolishly with happiness, "We're wearing matching clothes, like a couple's outfit~" [[4661 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao's smile gradually faded when she heard this. [[4662 旁白 neutral]]
This was a shirt she found in the closet. They used to live together, so she left three sets of clothes here. [[4663 旁白 neutral]]
She bought it with Chi Xiaocheng back then. [[4664 旁白 neutral]]
The same style, the same color, bought in pairs. It was originally a testament to their good relationship, but at this moment, it was misunderstood as a couple's outfit. [[4665 旁白 neutral]]
Was this a boomerang from the past hitting her? [[4666 旁白 neutral]]
While she was lost in thought, Chi Xiaocheng had already finished cleaning the floor with a mop. After returning, she sat in front of Su Tao, smiling, "So, Tao Tao, what do you want to talk about?" [[4667 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao suppressed her thoughts and looked at her, sitting upright, "Xiaocheng, why... why are you doing this?" [[4668 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head in confusion, "Why am I like this... Because Tao Tao is sick, and I'm taking care of Tao Tao." [[4669 池小橙 neutral]]
"I'm not sick!" Su Tao emphasized, "You're the one who's sick, Xiaocheng. Besides, if you keep me here to take care of me, people outside will look for me. It's easy for something to go wrong. You should let me out." [[4670 苏桃 angry]]
"It's okay." Chi Xiaocheng shook her head indifferently, "As long as I can be with Tao Tao, it doesn't matter. Even if Ye Liang comes looking..." [[4671 池小橙 neutral]]
Suddenly, Chi Xiaocheng's eyes glowed red, "At worst, I'll die with him!" [[4672 池小橙 angry]]
After saying that, she looked at Su Tao obsessively, "Tao Tao, don't worry, I will never let him hurt you~" [[4673 池小橙 neutral]]
The one who will be hurt is you! [[4674 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was anxious, but she also understood that even if Chi Xiaocheng could communicate, it was limited to ordinary topics. [[4675 旁白 neutral]]
Once she mentioned herself, or Ye Liang and others, she would become paranoid, and nothing she said would be useful. [[4676 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was a little anxious, "Then if I'm sick and you're taking care of me, how can I get well and be discharged?" [[4677 苏桃 sad]]
"Tao Tao has a heart problem, it needs to be treated." Chi Xiaocheng's smile didn't fade, "Naturally, when Tao Tao falls in love with me, she can be discharged!" [[4678 池小橙 neutral]]
"Tao Tao has a good impression of Ye Liang now, right?" [[4679 池小橙 neutral]]
"No." [[4680 池小橙 neutral]]
"Tao Tao doesn't like me at all now, right?" [[4681 池小橙 neutral]]
"There's nothing I can do. Tao Tao used to like me so much, but now she says she has a good impression of Ye Liang. She's very sick~" [[4682 池小橙 neutral]]
"Tao Tao!" Chi Xiaocheng's tone gradually became pathological, revealing her aggressive yet cute little fangs, "You can only like me!" [[4683 池小橙 angry]]
"Oh, I seem to be excited again." Chi Xiaocheng seemed to realize something, returning to normal, her bared fangs transforming from aggressive to subtly cute. [[4684 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao saw all of this, and her heart felt very uncomfortable. [[4685 旁白 neutral]]
She was truly a yandere. [[4686 旁白 neutral]]
Communication... completely ineffective. [[4687 旁白 neutral]]
A feeling of helplessness surged through her. Su Tao looked up, but her peripheral vision caught Chi Xiaocheng's cute little face. [[4688 旁白 neutral]]
How long has she been here? [[4689 旁白 neutral]]
How long has she slept? [[4690 旁白 neutral]]
Based on her fatigue when she woke up, it should have been two days, right? [[4691 旁白 neutral]]
What about outside? Have the three people who know the inside story—Doctor Cheng, Qianqian, and Si Chen—already come looking for her through their own channels? [[4692 旁白 neutral]]
At this point, there was only one thing to do! [[4693 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao clenched her fists. [[4694 旁白 neutral]]
She still hadn't regained much strength, but subduing the weak little Xiaocheng should be possible. [[4695 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao secretly scrutinized the completely harmless Chi Xiaocheng. Her arms were delicate and fair, looking like they had no strength. [[4696 旁白 neutral]]
She could try. [[4697 旁白 neutral]]
But— [[4698 旁白 neutral]]
Failure would further provoke Xiaocheng! [[4699 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes slowly became firm. [[4700 旁白 neutral]]
Will she win? [[4701 旁白 neutral]]
In a flash, Su Tao suddenly attacked, her hand grabbing towards Chi Xiaocheng's shoulder! [[4702 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng just tilted her head and easily caught Su Tao's hand. [[4703 旁白 neutral]]
She pushed back, effortlessly pressing Su Tao onto the bed. [[4704 旁白 neutral]]
She was bound to lose. [[4705 旁白 neutral]]
Her disheveled hair scattered, Su Tao's eyes filled with shock. [[4706 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's smile seemed to have everything under control, "Tao Tao is really disobedient. Didn't I tell you? I've tried it. This little thing can help you regulate your body very well. Why are you still trying to be rough when you're sick?" [[4707 池小橙 neutral]]
Her expression gradually froze. [[4708 旁白 neutral]]
Her head stiffly tilted to the side, her eyes staring at the table in horror. [[4709 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao: "That incense burner..." [[4710 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled, everything unspoken. [[4711 旁白 neutral]]
"How does a doctor treat a disobedient patient?" [[4712 池小橙 neutral]]
A clear tear slowly flowed from Su Tao's eye. [[4713 旁白 neutral]]
Although she resisted immensely in her heart, Su Tao herself didn't notice that the human body is miraculous precisely because it cannot be fully controlled. [[4714 旁白 neutral]]
Her breathing and heartbeat gradually accelerated. [[4715 旁白 neutral]]
