Chapter 67 Who Would You Save If I and Ye Liang Fell into the Water? (Bonus for x-Melody) [[5848 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song sat in the passenger seat, deep in thought. [[5849 旁白 neutral]]
He wasn't sure why these people were watching his little sister, or to what extent the "being bullied" in the WeChat message meant. [[5850 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking this, he looked up, his eyes suddenly cold. [[5851 旁白 neutral]]
In any case, these people must have ill intentions towards his little sister and could not be left alone! [[5852 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll get off the car for a while. You guys move the car and see if there are any hidden sentries. If not, take care of these three!" [[5853 池松 neutral]]
"Alright!" [[5854 梁黑 neutral]]
Liang Hei nodded, and the few of them quickly began to act. [[5855 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song stood at the community entrance, lit a cigarette, and looked at his phone. [[5856 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to call Chi Xiaocheng to ask, but then he thought it would be bad to disturb her sleep. [[5857 旁白 neutral]]
So he just stood there, enduring the cold wind. [[5858 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, it wasn't snowing at the moment, and his jacket was barely enough to withstand the cold. [[5859 旁白 neutral]]
After standing for about half an hour, Liang Hei sent a message, "Brother Song, no hidden sentries found." [[5860 梁黑 neutral]]
Chi Song's eyes turned cold, "Then silence them all and interrogate them to find out who sent them!" [[5861 池松 angry]]
Liang Hei: "Won't that alert the enemy?" [[5862 梁黑 neutral]]
Chi Song: "They've already sent people to watch, so the situation won't get any better. It's better to just eliminate them than give them a chance to report back!" [[5863 池松 angry]]
Liang Hei: "What if it's a misunderstanding? What if they're not watching Orange?" [[5864 梁黑 neutral]]
"Wouldn't that be even better?" Chi Song chuckled, "I'm not here to find my little sister. I'm just passing by. Remember to pay attention to the cameras on the roadside." [[5865 池松 neutral]]
"Understood, Brother Song." [[5866 梁黑 neutral]]
No matter what, just do it! [[5867 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song glanced at the burly men again and walked into the community. [[5868 旁白 neutral]]
He trusted his subordinates to handle things. [[5869 旁白 neutral]]
If those people were really sent to watch his little sister, and things got so big, it would be dangerous here. It would be better to take her to Lizhi City, where it would be safer on his territory. [[5870 旁白 neutral]]
Without waking the old security guard who was slacking off, Chi Song climbed over the gate and soon found his way home. [[5871 旁白 neutral]]
He entered the electronic password and opened the door. [[5872 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song didn't turn on the lights and quietly walked in like a thief. [[5873 旁白 neutral]]
He turned on his flashlight and found a thermos cup on the table, with a note tucked underneath. [[5874 旁白 neutral]]
The handwriting was beautiful. [[5875 旁白 neutral]]
"Brother, there's hot water in the thermos, and rice is still warm in the rice cooker..." [[5876 池小橙 neutral]]
The living room was empty, but looking at the air conditioner, it was clear that Chi Xiaocheng had already gone to sleep. [[5877 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song went into the kitchen and lifted the lid of the rice cooker. He found that not only was there warm rice inside, but also a few sausages and vegetables on a plate, warming on top of the rice. [[5878 旁白 neutral]]
Returning in the middle of the night after several hours of driving, how could he not be hungry? [[5879 旁白 neutral]]
Holding the thermos cup, Chi Song felt his eyes redden. [[5880 旁白 neutral]]
He, who hadn't shed a tear even when stabbed, now felt a lump in his throat. [[5881 旁白 neutral]]
He picked up the rice cooker directly and walked out the door. [[5882 旁白 neutral]]
He found his subordinates. [[5883 旁白 neutral]]
And went to a restaurant to eat together. [[5884 旁白 neutral]]
He proudly boasted: How did you know my sister left me food? [[5885 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng enjoyed the air conditioning in her room and slept until dawn. [[5886 旁白 neutral]]
Last night, she sent a message to Si Chen. This morning, as soon as she woke up, she saw Si Chen's reply. [[5887 旁白 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng, what did you do to Su Tao these past three days? I feel like she's in a bad state mentally, and she even told me to find a psychologist for you. What's going on?" [[5888 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng huddled in her blanket, hugging a panda pillow, "Did you reply to her?" [[5889 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Not yet. I just saw the message after waking up. I feel like something's wrong with you, so I asked you first." [[5890 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng saw the message and breathed a sigh of relief. [[5891 旁白 neutral]]
That's great. It seems Su Tao is asking Si Chen for help. [[5892 旁白 neutral]]
If that's the case... [[5893 旁白 neutral]]
"It's nothing. Just find a psychologist for her as she said. But during the examination, your doctor will have to cooperate with me and give her a fake medical report." [[5894 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Are you sure? Su Tao's request when she asked me to find a doctor was about your... uh... some mental problems." [[5895 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "I know. She just wants to find a psychologist to see if my yandere tendencies can be cured." [[5896 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen was also one of her own, and he had come to test her last time. [[5897 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew it well, so she just spoke frankly. [[5898 旁白 neutral]]
But Si Chen was no longer calm, "Wait a minute, you know you're a yandere?" [[5899 司辰 surprised]]
Didn't they say yanderes don't know they're yanderes? [[5900 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Of course I'm not a yandere." [[5901 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Huh?" [[5902 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Now that we're on the same side, I won't hide anything from you. The last time I was with you, I was acting." [[5903 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Huh???" [[5904 司辰 surprised]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Why are you so surprised? If I were really a yandere, it wouldn't have been as simple as just scratching your face last time." [[5905 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "???" [[5906 司辰 surprised]]
No, sister! [[5907 司辰 sad]]
If I hadn't dodged in time last time, my face would have been scratched up, okay? And you were acting like a madwoman, and you're telling me you're not a yandere? [[5908 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen was silent for a while. [[5909 旁白 neutral]]
He really wanted to call Chi Xiaocheng again and tell her he liked Su Tao to see her reaction. [[5910 旁白 neutral]]
But feeling the lingering sting on his back, he extinguished that thought. [[5911 旁白 neutral]]
Yanderes don't know they're yanderes. [[5912 旁白 neutral]]
It seems this statement is correct. This guy is a yandere herself, and she actually thinks she's acting? [[5913 旁白 neutral]]
Sitting in front of his computer at home, Si Chen's expression changed rapidly. [[5914 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, he sent a message, "So your idea is that I find a psychologist for you, and then in front of Su Tao, say that you're actually a yandere, a very serious one?" [[5915 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Yes, it's best to give me some kind of mental trauma case, to make Su Tao feel like I'll die in front of her if she leaves me, just like a yandere, you know?" [[5916 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "..." [[5917 司辰 neutral]]
I can't tell, I really can't tell! [[5918 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen sighed, "I think I understand your idea. Besides Su Tao, is there anything else?" [[5919 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Oh, yes." [[5920 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Tell me." [[5921 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Ye Liang and I broke up. Go kill him." [[5922 池小橙 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[5923 司辰 surprised]]
I haven't seen you guys for a few days, how did such a big thing happen?! [[5924 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen looked at the chat history and couldn't help but doubt life. Was choosing Chi Xiaocheng really the right thing to do? [[5925 旁白 neutral]]
He felt like he had boarded a pirate ship. [[5926 旁白 neutral]]
Helplessly, he replied faintly, "I'm almost kicked out of the family. My influence and connections are only a little. How can I fight Ye Liang?" [[5927 司辰 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Then you guide Su Tao, belittle Ye Liang and praise me." [[5928 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Okay, okay, I know what to do." [[5929 司辰 neutral]]
Hmph, even the psychologist is my person. Tao Tao, how will you escape my grasp? [[5930 旁白 neutral]]
First, give her a shot, something strong! [[5931 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng immediately opened Su Tao's WeChat contacts, "Tao Tao, good morning~" [[5932 池小橙 neutral]]
"It's really not easy to wake up without you by my side." [[5933 池小橙 neutral]]
"The day you left, Ye Liang also found me, and we had a little spat." [[5934 池小橙 neutral]]
"So... I... I have a question for you." [[5935 池小橙 neutral]]
"If I and Ye Liang both fell into the water, who would you save?" [[5936 池小橙 neutral]]
