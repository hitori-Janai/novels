Chapter 14: A New Plan (Thanks to 汐汐是也 for the tip) [[1172 旁白 neutral]]
"System, do you know something?" [[1173 池小橙 neutral]]
[What?] [[1174 系统 neutral]]
"I've been in this world for over two days and I've seen Su Tao a few times. I always thought the so-called 'white moonlight' female lead was just a character the author gave a bunch of halos to make her appealing. I even treated her as just a tool for my survival." [[1175 池小橙 neutral]]
"I look down on that Huang Limei, and I know saving the damsel in distress is cliché, but I have to admit, this female lead... she's kind of charming." [[1176 池小橙 neutral]]
Of course, there were no feelings of love. [[1177 旁白 neutral]]
It was more like appreciation, limited only to Su Tao's beauty. [[1178 旁白 neutral]]
Sometimes, she even looked down on her, because she was just a puppet protagonist created by an author, with no real personality. [[1179 旁白 neutral]]
But that shoulder throw, that knee strike, and that slap just now... [[1180 旁白 neutral]]
They really impressed Chi Xiaocheng. [[1181 旁白 neutral]]
And that gentle, concerned look in her eyes touched her heart. [[1182 旁白 neutral]]
Half-covering her face, Chi Xiaocheng sat on the ground, lowered her head, and apologized to Su Tao, "I'm sorry." [[1183 池小橙 sad]]
"What are you talking about?" Su Tao reached out, helped Chi Xiaocheng up, and then gently touched her cheek, carefully wiping the slapped right side. [[1184 苏桃 neutral]]
"Does it hurt?" [[1185 苏桃 neutral]]
If she didn't have her skills, she probably would have cried. [[1186 旁白 neutral]]
But right now, it felt okay. [[1187 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling the gentle touch and the warmth of her fingertips on her cheek, Chi Xiaocheng gave a silly smile, "I'm used to it." [[1188 池小橙 sad]]
Those three words made Su Tao's heart ache again. [[1189 旁白 neutral]]
She took a soft breath, "Let's go back to the dorm first. I'll put some medicine on it for you." [[1190 苏桃 neutral]]
Leaning on her for support, Chi Xiaocheng didn't dare to look her in the eye. "Taotao, you don't hate me, do you?" [[1191 池小橙 sad]]
"Hmm?" [[1192 苏桃 neutral]]
"I did such a terrible thing to you in the basement, and you've been ignoring me these past two days. You must really hate me, right?" [[1193 池小橙 sad]]
"Well..." [[1194 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's question hit a nerve. The thing Su Tao least wanted to face was Chi Xiaocheng's strange behavior in the basement. [[1195 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed quite normal now, though. [[1196 旁白 neutral]]
Without makeup, she looked cute and a little fragile. [[1197 旁白 neutral]]
Just like the Chi Xiaocheng she remembered from their childhood. [[1198 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be... that last time was an accident? [[1199 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at the lowered head of Chi Xiaocheng and asked tentatively, "Then, Xiaocheng, do you still like me?" [[1200 苏桃 neutral]]
"I do." [[1201 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng answered without any hesitation, the words coming out almost as soon as Su Tao finished speaking. [[1202 旁白 neutral]]
But with her head down, her expression was impossible to see. [[1203 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was at a loss for words. After a moment, her dry lips trembled as she replied, "How could I hate you, Xiaocheng? Just now, you were going to give water to Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang because you saw me stand up and wanted to give it to them, right?" [[1204 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't answer; her silence was an affirmation. [[1205 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled, "Xiaocheng is always paying attention to me, so how could I really hate you?" [[1206 苏桃 happy]]
If she had hated her, she would have stopped caring about the original owner long ago. [[1207 旁白 neutral]]
"After all, we are good sisters." [[1208 苏桃 neutral]]
She avoided the topic of love and steered the conversation toward friendship. [[1209 旁白 neutral]]
The two arrived at dorm room 801. Su Tao told Chi Xiaocheng to sit down and quickly took out a tube of ointment from her drawer. [[1210 旁白 neutral]]
"Close your eyes. I'll be gentle, I promise it won't hurt." [[1211 苏桃 neutral]]
Her index finger felt a bit cold as it touched Chi Xiaocheng's cheek. [[1212 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't see Su Tao's expression, but it wasn't hard to guess it was focused and gentle. [[1213 旁白 neutral]]
Actions can reveal a person's inner feelings. Accompanied by that unique, light fragrance of a girl, Chi Xiaocheng truly enjoyed having the medicine applied. [[1214 池小橙 happy]]
It seemed that after she revealed her yandere personality in the basement, Su Tao's self-persuasion over the past two days had worked quite well. [[1215 旁白 neutral]]
But with her being so gentle now, it made her next plan a bit difficult to execute. [[1216 旁白 neutral]]
As she was thinking, Su Tao's cheerful voice broke the silence, "Alright, you'll be fine after a little rest, Xiaocheng. Luckily, it's not swollen or scraped, so there won't be a scar." [[1217 苏桃 happy]]
"Mhm, thank you, Taotao." Chi Xiaocheng smiled happily. [[1218 池小橙 happy]]
Then, remembering something, she took out the bottle of mineral water from the basketball court. [[1219 旁白 neutral]]
Holding it in her hands once again, she offered it to Su Tao. "Taotao, have some water and rest a bit?" [[1220 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao shook her head and put the other medicines into a small bag. "I won't have any. During the game just now, Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang bumped into each other and got hurt. I need to take some medicine to them, so I have to go." [[1221 苏桃 neutral]]
No wonder she came back before the game was over. [[1222 旁白 neutral]]
So that was the reason. [[1223 旁白 neutral]]
A dangerous smile touched the corner of Chi Xiaocheng's lips, her eyes deep and thoughtful. [[1224 池小橙 neutral]]
Her next plan was forming. [[1225 旁白 neutral]]
Still holding the water bottle, she stood up and tried to persuade her, "Taotao, are you sure you don't want a sip? Or do you not like mineral water?" [[1226 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao walked to the door and gave Chi Xiaocheng a strange look. [[1227 旁白 neutral]]
That was a very odd question. [[1228 旁白 neutral]]
She looked Chi Xiaocheng up and down and saw that she still looked normal. Waving her hand, she hurried out the door. [[1229 旁白 neutral]]
Last time must have been an accident. Xiaocheng seems perfectly normal. [[1230 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't notice that the moment she left, Chi Xiaocheng's hand holding the water bottle dropped. [[1231 旁白 neutral]]
Her red pupils glowed, and the smile on her lips grew increasingly wicked. [[1232 旁白 angry]]
[Host, what wicked thoughts are you having now?] [[1233 系统 neutral]]
"System, it seems the male leads are much more important to her than I am." [[1234 池小橙 angry]]
[Isn't that obvious? She was always straight to begin with, so bending her won't be easy. Besides, the male leads have their own halos.] [[1235 系统 neutral]]
"But this is all just a tragedy in the end!" [[1236 池小橙 sad]]
In the book's ending, except for the male leads, every female character was treated like a joke. [[1237 旁白 neutral]]
And none of them had a good end. [[1238 旁白 neutral]]
Including the destined female lead, Su Tao. [[1239 旁白 neutral]]
This was why Chi Xiaocheng had said that Su Tao would reach the peak of her life in the early to middle stages, but didn't mention the later part. [[1240 旁白 neutral]]
In her past life, the book became popular not just because it was well-written, but because of the author's shocking twist in the later stages. [[1241 旁白 neutral]]
In the latter part of the story, a rich female reader appeared and tipped the author 1,000,000 RMB, asking for a character based on her to be written into the story. [[1242 旁白 neutral]]
To seize this massive fortune and get on the rich woman's good side, the author followed her instructions, added a new supporting character, and wrote the rest of the story according to the rich woman's wishes. [[1243 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, this new character rose up and took all the male leads who originally liked Su Tao for herself, and the whole book started to pave the way for her. [[1244 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, the true female lead, Su Tao, was written as a clown, humiliated by this new character, and had falling outs with all the male leads due to various plots. [[1245 旁白 neutral]]
She was despised, cursed, and beaten. [[1246 旁白 neutral]]
The author gave her countless moments of hope, only to crush them with despair again and again. [[1247 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, after developing severe depression, she died by suicide in a small rented room. [[1248 旁白 sad]]
It was because of this drastic change that the book was heavily criticized by readers. As good as the first half was, the second half was just as bad. [[1249 旁白 neutral]]
Ultimately, it went viral, even becoming popular among male readers for a while. [[1250 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat on Su Tao's bed, hugging one of her favorite cat plushies and gently playing with her pigtail. [[1251 旁白 neutral]]
"Even setting aside the original plot of the novel, such moonlight-like gentleness... I really want to have it all to myself~" [[1252 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng searched in the system store and quickly found an item she wanted. [[1253 旁白 neutral]]
[Energy Pill: Price 200 Emotion Points] [[1254 系统 neutral]]
[Description: A miraculous pill that can replenish the body's energy.] [[1255 系统 neutral]]
"It's a bit expensive, and I don't know how effective it is, but this body of mine is too weak. If I want to carry out the plan I just thought of, I can't do without this." [[1256 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the bottle of mineral water on the desk. [[1257 旁白 neutral]]
"I've been rejected twice now." [[1258 池小橙 sad]]
"It seems Taotao doesn't like to drink water." [[1259 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng chuckled, unscrewed the cap of the water bottle, and poured all the water into the sink. [[1260 旁白 neutral]]
She then placed the empty bottle in a prominent spot on Su Tao's desk before slowly walking out of the dorm. [[1261 旁白 neutral]]
Her two pigtails swayed gently with her movements. [[1262 旁白 neutral]]
The basketball game ended quickly. Ye Liang's blue team narrowly beat Dongfang Yang's red team by 3 points. [[1263 旁白 neutral]]
The game seemed like a contest for Su Tao, and the loser, Dongfang Yang, looked annoyed. [[1264 旁白 neutral]]
As the winner, Ye Liang was naturally happy to show off in front of Su Tao. [[1265 旁白 neutral]]
He followed up with a winner's invitation, "Su Tao, thanks for your cheering. I definitely couldn't have beaten this guy Dongfang Yang without you. How about I treat you to dinner tonight?" [[1266 叶良 happy]]
"Well..." [[1267 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao hesitated, glancing at Dongfang Yang. [[1268 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, the three of them should have gone together. [[1269 旁白 neutral]]
Before Ye Liang could say anything, Dongfang Yang waved his hand in refusal, "I have something to do tonight, you two go ahead." [[1270 东方阳 neutral]]
With that, he slung his jacket over his shoulder, waved, and walked away. [[1271 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang smiled triumphantly and said again, "Su Tao, you can't refuse me this time. You said last time you'd treat me to a meal to thank me properly." [[1272 叶良 happy]]
Su Tao sighed helplessly, "Alright, but I have to make it clear first, I don't drink alcohol, and..." [[1273 苏桃 neutral]]
Before she could finish, her phone chimed with a "ding-dong." Su Tao picked it up with a puzzled look and saw a message from Chi Xiaocheng. [[1274 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Taotao, I have something to tell you. I'll be waiting for you on the rooftop of the dorm at 9 PM tonight." [[1275 池小橙 neutral]]
Ye Liang wiped his sweat, not looking at Su Tao, and asked, "What's wrong?" [[1276 叶良 neutral]]
Su Tao came back to her senses, closed the chat window, and put her phone away. "It's nothing. What are we eating tonight?" [[1277 苏桃 neutral]]
Ye Liang snapped his fingers: "The weather forecast says there will be heavy rain tonight, so let's not go shopping. I know a fun place to take you, it starts at 9. I guarantee you'll like it!" [[1278 叶良 happy]]
Just then, a flash of lightning cut across the sky. [[1279 旁白 neutral]]
Followed by a roll of thunder. [[1280 旁白 neutral]]
BOOM—— [[1281 旁白 neutral]]
The evening sunset was gradually hidden by dark clouds, blooming into a blood-red color. [[1282 旁白 neutral]]
