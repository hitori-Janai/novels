Chapter 251: Does Dongfang Yang like Xiaocheng? [[21377 旁白 neutral]]
Despicable? [[21378 苏桃 neutral]]
Xiaocheng only asked something like that because her memories were confused and she felt insecure. She was focused on the "present," not the "past." [[21379 苏桃 neutral]]
But in my own response, I addressed even my past mistakes. Then, knowing Xiaocheng had no memory of the past, I used that answer to comfort myself. [[21380 苏桃 neutral]]
But... if it's despicable, so be it. [[21381 苏桃 neutral]]
I will definitely keep my word and my promise. [[21382 苏桃 neutral]]
It's better that Xiaocheng doesn't know. I can still protect her from the shadows, and she can continue to be happy every day. [[21383 苏桃 neutral]]
There's no need to awaken her memories, no need to make her experience the pain of the past. This is enough. [[21384 苏桃 neutral]]
Anyway. [[21385 苏桃 neutral]]
I'm already that kind of despicable person, aren't I? [[21386 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao was relieved that Xiaocheng wasn't hurt; she had only pretended to be slapped. [[21387 旁白 neutral]]
She was also thankful that she had briefly lost her mind and even had the thought of wanting Lin Fangya dead. [[21388 旁白 neutral]]
It was this firm belief and determination to protect Xiaocheng that made her feel safe, breaking through that faint sense of distance between them. [[21389 旁白 neutral]]
She called me "Sister Su Tao." [[21390 苏桃 happy]]
Our relationship has taken a big step forward! [[21391 苏桃 happy]]
I must be getting closer to hearing her call me "Taotao" again, right? [[21392 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao smiled faintly, feeling very happy. Just then, Dongfang Yang walked in from outside, looking rather upset. [[21393 旁白 neutral]]
After coming face-to-face with Second Young Master Ye, he spoke impatiently without needing any prompting, "This Lin Fangya conspired with Ye Liang to assassinate my sister, and now she publicly humiliates my sister in front of so many people." [[21394 东方阳 angry]]
"What, is my name, Dongfang Yang, not famous enough? Is a wretched woman like her worth protecting for you, Second Young Master Ye?" [[21395 东方阳 angry]]
"After the banquet, I'm taking this woman with me." [[21396 东方阳 angry]]
Second Young Master Ye narrowed his eyes, displeased. "Dongfang Yang, what do you mean by that? Jiuzhou City is not your stronghold in the capital." [[21397 叶二少 angry]]
Dongfang Yang sneered, flicking his robes, not taking Second Young Master Ye seriously at all. "Even if Ye Liang is dead, you're just one of the heirs of the Ye family. What, do you call the shots in Jiuzhou City?" [[21398 东方阳 angry]]
"I'm standing with Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng. If you're not happy about it, how about we settle this with a fight?" [[21399 东方阳 angry]]
His words were just short of a direct insult to Second Young Master Ye. [[21400 旁白 neutral]]
In the capital, his Dongfang family was no weaker than the Ye family. [[21401 旁白 neutral]]
And he, Dongfang Yang, was the only son of the main Dongfang family, the designated sole heir. As soon as the old man at home passed away, it would be his turn to take over the family. [[21402 旁白 neutral]]
Second Young Master Ye? [[21403 旁白 neutral]]
Before he truly became the head of the Ye family, to Dongfang Yang, he was at best slightly better off than a stray dog on the street. [[21404 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't give the other man any face, which made the young masters from other families even more intrigued. [[21405 旁白 neutral]]
Not because of this particular drama. [[21406 旁白 neutral]]
But because of the two girls, Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao. [[21407 旁白 neutral]]
How Ye Liang died was no longer important. With the Ye family's fall, they, as fellow families in Jiuzhou City, were all opportunists who benefited more or less. Only the investors who relied on the Ye family lost everything. [[21408 旁白 neutral]]
And those people had long been excluded, with no chance to attend this banquet. [[21409 旁白 neutral]]
People with sharp eyes were already thinking. [[21410 旁白 neutral]]
What kind of benefits could these two girls bring to make the two men turn against Second Young Master Ye so openly? [[21411 旁白 neutral]]
Nothing was set in stone, but Second Young Master Ye still had a good chance of becoming the future heir of the Ye family! [[21412 旁白 neutral]]
Could it really be just because of their beauty? [[21413 旁白 neutral]]
They couldn't figure it out, but they didn't need to. [[21414 旁白 neutral]]
Just being able to witness such drama was satisfying enough for those present. [[21415 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, some people were not happy, like the rest of the Lin family, who looked pale with worry because of Lin Fangya. [[21416 旁白 neutral]]
Also hiding in the crowd was the miracle doctor Chu Lingfeng; there was no place for him on the stage this time. [[21417 旁白 neutral]]
As someone attached to a branch of the Si family, his status was far below that of Si Chen, Dongfang Yang, and Second Young Master Ye. [[21418 旁白 neutral]]
He just hid in the crowd, staring at Chi Xiaocheng like a venomous snake. [[21419 旁白 neutral]]
He touched his half-ear, continuously supplying Chi Xiaocheng with Emotion Points. [[21420 旁白 neutral]]
The farce temporarily ended when Dongfang Yang used the excuse of taking Chi Xiaocheng to the hospital to check her injuries. [[21421 旁白 neutral]]
The official start of the banquet was delayed, but the topic of conversation had gradually shifted from business to Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao. [[21422 旁白 neutral]]
What kind of secrets were these two girls hiding to make the young masters of the Dongfang and Si families so concerned? [[21423 旁白 neutral]]
Moving from the front hall to the backyard, Si Chen was representing them, dealing with other guests. Dongfang Yang took advantage of Chi Xiaocheng changing out of her gown to say helplessly to Su Tao, "This Lin Fangya approached Second Young Master Ye alone. I've searched the entire villa and haven't found Xiao Ming." [[21424 东方阳 neutral]]
He had thought that since Lin Fangya and Xiao Ming disappeared together, the two were a pair. [[21425 旁白 neutral]]
If Lin Fangya appeared, Xiao Ming was bound to be hiding somewhere, and he wanted to use this chance to catch the guy. [[21426 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. [[21427 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao wasn't too disappointed about this. She was already very happy that her relationship with Xiaocheng was good again. [[21428 旁白 neutral]]
She asked, puzzled, "If we can capture Lin Fangya, can't we find out a lot by questioning her?" [[21429 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang shook his head helplessly, "I'm afraid it won't be that simple. She's probably hiding some secret, otherwise Second Young Master Ye wouldn't have turned on me because of her." [[21430 东方阳 neutral]]
"He turned on you? It looked like Second Young Master Ye backed down just now." [[21431 苏桃 neutral]]
"It was basically the same as turning on me. A conflict in a place like this will definitely get back to the capital." [[21432 东方阳 neutral]]
"This..." Su Tao lowered her head, embarrassed. "I'm sorry, Dongfang Yang. I've caused you trouble again. I... I don't know how I can ever repay you." [[21433 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang laughed and rubbed his nose. "Don't be so formal. Besides, who asked you both to be... well, with our relationship, what's a little trouble? Anyway, helping you is my own business. You don't need to overthink it." [[21434 东方阳 happy]]
Su Tao nodded lightly, feeling a warmth in her heart. [[21435 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang... he's such a good person. [[21436 苏桃 happy]]
She owed him so much she didn't know how to repay him. After the New Year, she would definitely have to manage the cafe Dongfang Yang gave her properly! [[21437 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way," Dongfang Yang said to Su Tao, "Tonight's goal has been initially achieved. With Si Chen and me as your backing, I doubt many people will dare to touch you directly. For now, why don't you two rest here for a while." [[21438 东方阳 neutral]]
"Just leave the rest to Si Chen and me." [[21439 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at the closed door of the changing room. "Can Xiaocheng and I walk around nearby then?" [[21440 苏桃 neutral]]
"Of course, no problem. I've sent a lot of bodyguards to the area." Dongfang Yang waved his hand and took out a bank card. "Use this card for whatever you want to buy. The password is Chi Xiaocheng's birthday." [[21441 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment. "Xiaocheng's birthday?" [[21442 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yeah." [[21443 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was a bit embarrassed to say it, but he had actually missed Chi Xiaocheng's birthday last time and had been wanting to give her a make-up gift. [[21444 旁白 neutral]]
After thinking about it, he really didn't know what Chi Xiaocheng liked. [[21445 旁白 neutral]]
So he decided to be simple and direct. He'd just add a million and let Chi Xiaocheng buy whatever she wanted. [[21446 旁白 neutral]]
He set the password to her birthday so the fool wouldn't forget it. [[21447 旁白 neutral]]
It just so happened that Su Tao was Chi Xiaocheng's older sister. Chi Xiaocheng seemed too foolish to manage money, so he felt better giving it to Su Tao. [[21448 旁白 neutral]]
But misunderstandings often arise from a small, embarrassing lack of information. [[21449 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, Su Tao's mind was filled with a single thought. [[21450 旁白 neutral]]
Why would Dongfang Yang's bank card password be set to Xiaocheng's birthday? [[21451 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be... he likes Xiaocheng? [[21452 旁白 neutral]]
