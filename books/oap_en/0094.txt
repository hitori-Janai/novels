Chapter 94: Su Tao's Possessiveness [[8206 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was very cute, there was no doubt about it. [[8207 旁白 neutral]]
Even with a mask on, when you couldn't see her face. [[8208 旁白 neutral]]
Just her small body, soft voice, smooth brown hair, and the fair skin of her arms visible in a short-sleeved shirt were enough to show how cute she was. [[8209 旁白 neutral]]
But when someone intentionally tried to look ugly, the contrast was very obvious. [[8210 旁白 neutral]]
It was like after enjoying Chi Xiaocheng's cute smiles for all this time. [[8211 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng's face covered in foundation, made up to look like a mess, Su Tao felt a fire of anger burning inside her. [[8212 旁白 angry]]
She had a strange feeling that Xiaocheng's innocence had been tainted. [[8213 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao's serious face and her silence, Chi Xiaocheng turned slightly, showing a worried and timid expression. "Um, Taotao... why aren't you saying anything?" [[8214 池小橙 sad]]
Xiu Hua and her roommate also looked at Su Tao, with triumphant smiles on their faces. [[8215 旁白 neutral]]
Xiu Hua said mockingly, "Isn't this Su Tao? Why did you follow us here? My Xiaocheng doesn't want you anymore, so why are you trying so hard when you're not wanted?" [[8216 曾秀花 angry]]
Su Tao slowly looked up, her gaze cold. "Your Xiaocheng?" [[8217 苏桃 angry]]
Xiu Hua sneered, "Xiaocheng used to tell me you were like a good older sister to her. But for months since school started, you've been chasing after those worthless men and ignoring her. So I say she's mine now, what's wrong with that?" [[8218 曾秀花 angry]]
The roommate added, "You can't give Xiaocheng what she wants, so stop bothering her, okay?" [[8219 舍友 angry]]
Seeing that they were about to argue, Chi Xiaocheng looked both cute and flustered. She held out her hands, looking back and forth as if she didn't know what to do. [[8220 旁白 neutral]]
She said anxiously, "Let's... let's talk this out. Can we please not fight?" [[8221 池小橙 sad]]
Her voice seemed even softer than usual. [[8222 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao walked in, her face still dark. But she didn't walk directly to Chi Xiaocheng, stopping about three meters in front of her instead. [[8223 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because she was angry, her words to Chi Xiaocheng lacked their usual gentleness and were instead demanding. "Xiaocheng, come here." [[8224 苏桃 angry]]
Xiu Hua let go of Chi Xiaocheng's shoulder with a confident smirk. "Xiaocheng, we are best friends, the best sisters, aren't we? I won't let Su Tao bully you. Come hide behind me." [[8225 曾秀花 happy]]
This was a fight for Chi Xiaocheng. [[8226 旁白 neutral]]
Did she need to hesitate? [[8227 池小橙 neutral]]
Of course, she did. If she went to Taotao without any hesitation, it would be too easy. How would she cherish it then? [[8228 池小橙 neutral]]
The current Xiaocheng was not a yandere. [[8229 旁白 neutral]]
So Chi Xiaocheng's intermediate acting skills continued to shine. [[8230 旁白 neutral]]
She stood up from the chair, her face half-covered in ugly makeup. [[8231 旁白 neutral]]
First, she took two steps toward Su Tao. [[8232 旁白 neutral]]
Then she turned back to look at Xiu Hua. [[8233 旁白 neutral]]
Her and the roommate's smiles stiffened, clearly not expecting Chi Xiaocheng to walk towards Su Tao. [[8234 旁白 neutral]]
But when Chi Xiaocheng turned back to them, their stiff smiles quickly turned gentle again. [[8235 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned and walked towards Su Tao again. [[8236 旁白 neutral]]
But after two more steps, she looked back once more. [[8237 旁白 neutral]]
There was a hint of reluctance in her eyes, which Su Tao clearly saw. [[8238 旁白 neutral]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng could say anything, Su Tao grabbed her arm and pulled her gently. [[8239 旁白 neutral]]
She pulled Chi Xiaocheng into her arms. [[8240 旁白 neutral]]
The faint, sweet scent of a young woman filled her nose. [[8241 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao shifted, protectively moving Chi Xiaocheng behind her. [[8242 旁白 neutral]]
But her frowning eyebrows showed that she was not satisfied with Chi Xiaocheng's reaction. [[8243 旁白 angry]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, now hiding behind her, had a faint smile on her face. [[8244 池小橙 happy]]
That's it, Taotao. Be more possessive of me. [[8245 池小橙 happy]]
She had fixed the mistakes of the original owner from the past two months, dealt with Xiu Hua and her friends, and put a little pressure on Su Tao to develop her possessiveness. [[8246 旁白 happy]]
It was a complete victory. [[8247 旁白 happy]]
As for Xiu Hua and her friend, their faces turned cold when they saw this. [[8248 旁白 neutral]]
She pointed at Chi Xiaocheng and yelled, "Chi Xiaocheng, after we treated you so well and always saw you as a sister, helping you with everything and even buying you makeup, you ungrateful traitor still care about Su Tao!" [[8249 曾秀花 angry]]
Su Tao laughed coldly. "You only did that because you were jealous of how cute Xiaocheng is. You took advantage of her innocence and you still dare to say things like that!" [[8250 苏桃 angry]]
"Makeup?" Su Tao walked to the table and picked up a small bottle. "How much is this stuff even worth? Besides, Xiaocheng is so cute, she doesn't need to wear any..." [[8251 苏桃 angry]]
Before she could finish the word "makeup," Su Tao froze. [[8252 旁白 neutral]]
She stared at the name on the makeup bottle, and then at the ingredients list. [[8253 旁白 neutral]]
Her anger boiled over. "This was on the news before! It causes skin allergies and sores. It's a harmful product that has been completely banned. You bought this for Xiaocheng to put on her face?" [[8254 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao reached out, grabbed Xiu Hua by the collar, and lifted her up with one hand. "What else have you done to Xiaocheng!" [[8255 苏桃 angry]]
Xiu Hua's face turned red as she was lifted. She struggled hard, and with a "rip," her cheap clothes tore. She fell to the ground, but she was free from Su Tao's grip. [[8256 旁白 neutral]]
Furious and embarrassed, she scrambled up. "Damn you, Su Tao! Let's get her together! I'll scratch your face up!" [[8257 曾秀花 angry]]
She angrily raised her nails and charged forward. [[8258 旁白 neutral]]
But was Su Tao an ordinary girl? [[8259 旁白 neutral]]
Pulling hair and scratching cheeks? [[8260 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't going to play that game. [[8261 旁白 neutral]]
The thought that Chi Xiaocheng's face could have been hurt because of her made Su Tao unable to control her anger. [[8262 旁白 angry]]
She shot out a hand and precisely grabbed Xiu Hua's attacking hand. [[8263 旁白 neutral]]
She forced her thumb and index finger between Xiu Hua's fingers and bent them back hard. [[8264 旁白 neutral]]
A "crack" of bone was heard. [[8265 旁白 neutral]]
Xiu Hua's face twisted in pain and she screamed like a pig being slaughtered, "Ahhhhhhh!" [[8266 曾秀花 sad]]
"That hurts, does it?" [[8267 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao looked at her mockingly. "When you were putting that makeup on Xiaocheng, did you ever think that her face could be ruined?" [[8268 苏桃 angry]]
The roommate standing by said tremblingly, "Su... Su Tao, this is a school. If you do this, you'll be punished for bullying!" [[8269 舍友 sad]]
"You're still talking?" [[8270 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao took a step and kicked her against the wall. [[8271 旁白 neutral]]
She said with a cold smile, "Aren't you the ones who were bullying her? Dongfang Yang donated a building to the school when the semester started. Do you think he won't help me?" [[8272 苏桃 angry]]
"Or maybe you want the whole dorm to watch this drama?" [[8273 苏桃 angry]]
As she spoke, she broke another one of her fingers. [[8274 旁白 neutral]]
Along with the scream, Su Tao kneed her in the stomach before throwing her aside. [[8275 旁白 neutral]]
She let her curl up on the ground, crying in pain. [[8276 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll deal with you later!" [[8277 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao turned and pulled Chi Xiaocheng towards the door. "Xiaocheng, come with me. I have makeup remover in my dorm. Let's get that stuff off your face first." [[8278 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng said timidly and hesitantly, "But..." [[8279 池小橙 sad]]
"No buts!" [[8280 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao put her index finger on Chi Xiaocheng's lips. [[8281 旁白 neutral]]
She took her hand and walked out. "Hurry up and come with me. If you don't listen, I won't want you anymore." [[8282 苏桃 angry]]
As they walked away, she didn't notice the strange, yet all-knowing smile on Chi Xiaocheng's face behind her. [[8283 旁白 neutral]]
The first step of the Taotao development plan is complete, I suppose. [[8284 池小橙 happy]]
Once someone becomes possessive, it's very hard to turn back. [[8285 池小橙 happy]]
