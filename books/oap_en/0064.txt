Chapter 64 Tearing Off the Facade, Until Death Do Us Part (Bonus for Night into Starry Sky) [[5624 旁白 neutral]]
In a sudden shock, the small knife, aimed directly at his waist, had already struck. Its speed was so fast that Ye Liang didn't even have time to counter and subdue her. [[5625 旁白 neutral]]
He barely managed to pull back and twist his waist, but his suit was still cut open at the waist, and a trickle of crimson flowed from the tip of the knife. [[5626 旁白 neutral]]
"You!" [[5627 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang turned sideways, lowering his head slightly, and met Chi Xiaocheng's vertical pupils, which glowed with a hint of crimson. [[5628 旁白 neutral]]
Like a fierce, maddened cat! [[5629 旁白 neutral]]
In a fleeting moment, Chi Xiaocheng tossed the knife into the air, and with a sidestep, her other hand instinctively caught the small knife and, with an inward thrust, stabbed directly at Ye Liang again. [[5630 旁白 neutral]]
Her body was small, and her movements were agile. [[5631 旁白 neutral]]
However, Ye Liang, as the male lead, was not a pushover. After being startled, he reacted and, with a forceful slap, pushed away Chi Xiaocheng's knife-wielding hand. [[5632 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, he quickly retreated two steps. [[5633 旁白 neutral]]
Adjusting his posture. [[5634 旁白 neutral]]
Like an enraged lion, "I originally didn't want to touch you because of Su Tao's desperate pleas, but you still dared to snatch Su Tao from me. You brought this upon yourself!" [[5635 叶良 angry]]
How much of a threat could a 1.5-meter loli be? [[5636 旁白 neutral]]
With such soft attacks and strength, since he, Ye Liang, could subdue her once, the second time would be just as easy! [[5637 旁白 neutral]]
Taking a big stride, Ye Liang reached out high and straight. [[5638 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to grab Chi Xiaocheng's neck again, like capturing a dragon, but when his eyes met her soft little hand, his expression changed drastically. [[5639 旁白 neutral]]
The small hand easily grabbed Ye Liang's wrist, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't move an inch forward. [[5640 旁白 neutral]]
Why was her strength so great?! [[5641 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't like this just now! [[5642 旁白 neutral]]
Amidst his shock, a "click" sounded, followed by a hoarse scream. [[5643 旁白 neutral]]
"Ugh—!" [[5644 叶良 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng dislocated his entire arm by twisting his wrist. [[5645 旁白 neutral]]
No, no, no! [[5646 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang retreated in horror, cold sweat pouring from his face, his breathing extremely disordered. [[5647 旁白 neutral]]
This guy is so small, why does she have so much strength?! [[5648 旁白 neutral]]
And... [[5649 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang looked at Chi Xiaocheng, who was walking towards him step by step, and couldn't help but swallow. [[5650 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, her tea-colored long hair was disheveled, partially covering her face. Only one eye remained under her messy bangs, its pupil vertical, glowing with a hint of crimson. [[5651 旁白 neutral]]
The hand holding the small knife hung limply, and drops of crimson liquid flowed from the tip of the knife. [[5652 旁白 neutral]]
Tick-tock. [[5653 旁白 neutral]]
The liquid dripped, staining the floor with a vibrant red rose. [[5654 旁白 neutral]]
Then it was covered by a huge shadow. Her small feet stepped on the vibrant red roses, walking towards him step by step. [[5655 旁白 neutral]]
Blackening: Eight times! [[5656 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, she's mine!" [[5657 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng murmured softly, then with a "whoosh," she darted out again. [[5658 旁白 neutral]]
"Damn it!" [[5659 叶良 angry]]
Ye Liang almost scrambled towards the door, shouting loudly, "What are you doing out there? Get in here and help!" [[5660 叶良 angry]]
The door outside had been left open, and the bodyguards were dutifully standing guard outside. [[5661 旁白 neutral]]
Upon hearing Ye Liang's voice, the man in the suit outside suddenly burst in. [[5662 旁白 neutral]]
It was the same man in the suit who had chased Chi Xiaocheng in the basement. [[5663 旁白 neutral]]
He glanced at the blackened Chi Xiaocheng, then saw his young master clutching an arm and fleeing in a panic, with a long, bleeding wound on his waist. [[5664 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang glared at the man in the suit, "What are you looking at? Go kill that guy!" [[5665 叶良 angry]]
"Ah? Me?" [[5666 西装男 neutral]]
The man in the suit met Chi Xiaocheng's strange vertical pupils and immediately felt a surge of fear. [[5667 旁白 neutral]]
One of the effects of cat pupils is to instill fear in those who meet their gaze. [[5668 旁白 neutral]]
This guy is clearly not right! [[5669 旁白 neutral]]
The man in the suit felt his scalp tingle. Without a word, he picked up Ye Liang and ran, "Young Master, let's go to the hospital first. I've been in this business for many years, and I disdain hitting women!" [[5670 西装男 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't chase after them until they left. She only recovered belatedly, then collapsed exhausted by the entrance. [[5671 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes gradually regained rationality. Chi Xiaocheng breathed a sigh of relief, "I was impulsive." [[5672 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, have you recovered?] [[5673 系统 neutral]]
"I was fine to begin with." Chi Xiaocheng poked her head out and glanced at the corridor camera, "It's a good thing the blackening skill worked at the critical moment. It's so annoying when it works sometimes and not others." [[5674 池小橙 neutral]]
"System, do you think it's because Ye Liang mentioned Su Tao, and his male lead halo was diluted by the female lead halo, that I was able to activate the blackening skill at the critical moment?" [[5675 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, is there a possibility that you yourself haven't realized that you are actually a little... I mean, a little bit yandere, which is why you can trigger the blackening skill?] [[5676 系统 neutral]]
"Huh?" Chi Xiaocheng scoffed, "Can't I tell if I'm a yandere myself? Whether it's the dependence, possessiveness, exclusion, or other types I've displayed, I've consciously acted them out, okay?" [[5677 池小橙 neutral]]
"Of course I'm not a yandere." [[5678 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng waved her hand, her face normal, "Alright, don't mention this anymore. I know my own situation. Instead, whether it was last time or this time, after the blackening skill is triggered, I become very weak. What's going on?" [[5679 池小橙 neutral]]
[Although blackening multiplies the host's combat power, it essentially compresses the body's potential. After the blackening state is removed, it will feedback negative weakness to the body based on the multiplier.] [[5680 系统 neutral]]
"So that's it." [[5681 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng exhaled again, her expression becoming complex, "Rather, the real trouble is yet to come. This blackening skill, besides making me weak afterwards, also affects my rationality. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been so impulsive just now." [[5682 池小橙 neutral]]
"Now, Tao Tao might not even be able to protect me." [[5683 池小橙 neutral]]
Given the situation just now, it's no exaggeration to say that she's now in a fight to the death with Ye Liang! [[5684 旁白 neutral]]
A cannon fodder villain, directly confronting one of the male leads? [[5685 旁白 neutral]]
"It's truly a difficult challenge." [[5686 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, you should act as soon as possible. Ye Liang's character will definitely seek revenge. How about letting the female lead Su Tao help?] [[5687 系统 neutral]]
"Impossible!" Chi Xiaocheng's voice was firm, "Last time, that guy took an inch and wanted Tao Tao to be his maid. Now that we've torn off the facade, he'll definitely restrict Tao Tao!" [[5688 池小橙 angry]]
"However, this is also an opportunity..." [[5689 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took out her phone, murmuring as she looked at Su Tao's WeChat profile picture. [[5690 旁白 neutral]]
She and Ye Liang had fallen out, and the conflict had intensified. [[5691 旁白 neutral]]
As the object of contention, Su Tao, despite intentionally not getting involved, would ultimately have to make a choice. [[5692 旁白 neutral]]
Choose herself? [[5693 旁白 neutral]]
Or choose Ye Liang, who she still had some good feelings for? [[5694 旁白 neutral]]
Tao Tao, you can't choose Ye Liang! [[5695 池小橙 angry]]
A red light flashed in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes, and she flipped to Doctor Cheng's alt account. [[5696 旁白 neutral]]
She had a new plan, a plan to make Su Tao and Ye Liang fall out! [[5697 旁白 neutral]]
"But before that, I need bodyguards." [[5698 池小橙 neutral]]
[Bodyguards?] [[5699 系统 neutral]]
The system expressed confusion. [[5700 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, although you have 1635 emotion points left after adding the few hundred provided by Ye Liang just now, you can't buy people in the shop. Should you ask the other male lead, Si Chen?] [[5701 系统 neutral]]
"Si Chen is not trustworthy for now." Chi Xiaocheng shook her head and clicked on a person's WeChat. [[5702 池小橙 neutral]]
She typed and sent a message, "Brother, I'm being bullied. Can you bring some people back to help me?" [[5703 池小橙 neutral]]
The message was received and replied almost instantly. [[5704 旁白 neutral]]
Invincible Brother: "Okay, I'll be home at midnight tonight." [[5705 天下无敌的哥哥 neutral]]
Looking at the few words of reply, Chi Xiaocheng's heart warmed. [[5706 旁白 neutral]]
To be honest, she didn't want to involve her brother. [[5707 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[5708 旁白 neutral]]
Plans can't keep up with changes! [[5709 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng then switched to Doctor Cheng's alt account and slowly edited a message to send to Su Tao. [[5710 旁白 neutral]]
So, between me and Ye Liang, Tao Tao, will you choose me? [[5711 旁白 neutral]]
Will you, or will you? [[5712 旁白 neutral]]
