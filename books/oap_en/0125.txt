Chapter 125: A Glimmer of Hope in Despair [[11033 旁白 neutral]]
The doctor looked worried, but when she saw Su Tao's desperate expression, she spoke gently. "We've saved her for now, but she lost a lot of blood. She needs to go back to the hospital for a transfusion right away." [[11034 女医生 neutral]]
Suddenly, a glimmer of hope appeared in Su Tao's desperate eyes. [[11035 旁白 neutral]]
Her hand, stained with dried blood, grabbed the doctor's sleeve. "Really, Doctor? But... I thought Xiaocheng wasn't breathing." [[11036 苏桃 sad]]
The doctor explained, "She lost too much blood. When that happens, breathing becomes very weak and you can barely feel it with your hand. The right way to check is to feel for a pulse on the neck." [[11037 女医生 neutral]]
"She was very lucky. Her body's ability to heal is strong, and her cells are more active than normal. The wound clotted quickly. After she passed out, her blood pressure dropped, which kept the clot in place. That, plus the first aid, saved her." [[11038 女医生 neutral]]
While she was talking, a few nurses had already put Chi Xiaocheng on a stretcher and were quickly but carefully carrying her out. [[11039 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang and Su Tao both looked. They were shocked by all the blood, but they also felt a sense of relief. [[11040 旁白 neutral]]
The doctor added, "She's not out of danger yet, but don't worry. We will do everything we can to save her." [[11041 女医生 neutral]]
After saying that, she quickly left the room with the other doctors and nurses. [[11042 旁白 neutral]]
As for Su Tao, the moment she heard that Chi Xiaocheng was alive, she closed her eyes and fainted on the sofa. [[11043 旁白 neutral]]
The constant switch between despair and hope, mixed with regret and guilt, was too much for her to handle. [[11044 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, it was amazing that she had held on for so long after such a painful experience. [[11045 旁白 neutral]]
Even as she fainted, she was still holding tightly to the suicide note. [[11046 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang sighed. He covered Su Tao with a blanket from the sofa and set the air conditioner to a comfortable temperature. [[11047 旁白 neutral]]
At least, nothing terrible had happened. [[11048 旁白 neutral]]
"She'll definitely be sad again when she wakes up, and it's hard for a guy like me to handle it." [[11049 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang scratched his head and simply took out his phone to make a call. [[11050 旁白 neutral]]
A lazy female voice came from the other side of the phone, "Dongfang Yang, what do you want? Forget about asking me on a date. People will think I'm trying to climb into your wealthy family." [[11051 钱清 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang said slowly, "Qian Qing, I'm at Su Tao's house. You remember the person I told you about last time, right?" [[11052 东方阳 neutral]]
"I remember. That commoner girl you're chasing. I thought she was in trouble after her conflict with Ye Liang, but it turned out Ye Liang was the one who got into trouble." [[11053 钱清 neutral]]
"She's not doing well right now. Could you come over and take care of her? And maybe help her calm down." [[11054 东方阳 neutral]]
Qian Qing replied, "Isn't this a great chance to make your move? Why don't you take care of her yourself and earn some points?" [[11055 钱清 neutral]]
"I, Dongfang Yang, am not the kind of person who takes advantage of others!" Dongfang Yang said righteously. "If I want to pursue someone, I'll do it openly and honestly. Besides, it's not proper for a man and woman to be so close, so I can't take care of her. Just hurry up and come over." [[11056 东方阳 neutral]]
"Really, tsundere Yang Yang?" [[11057 钱清 neutral]]
"I told you I'm not a tsundere!" [[11058 东方阳 angry]]
After finally convincing Qian Qing to come and help, Dongfang Yang pouted in annoyance. [[11059 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't have any female secretaries or student assistants. There weren't many women who could catch his eye. [[11060 旁白 neutral]]
He wasn't like that messy guy Ye Liang; he was mostly surrounded by men. [[11061 旁白 neutral]]
"Meow~" [[11062 旁白 neutral]]
With a meow from the corner, Dongfang Yang looked up and saw another man with glasses coming in through the door. [[11063 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen walked in. "I didn't expect you to be so fast. Is Chi Xiaocheng okay?" [[11064 司辰 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Si Chen strangely. "What are you doing here?" [[11065 东方阳 neutral]]
"To help, of course." Si Chen walked to another sofa and sat down. He glanced at Su Tao, who was asleep on the sofa with tear stains still on her face, and sighed to himself. [[11066 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng really went all out this time. [[11067 旁白 neutral]]
But from the looks of it, she probably wouldn't die. [[11068 旁白 neutral]]
So Si Chen looked at Dongfang Yang. "Su Tao called me here too. I didn't expect you to be faster than me. Anyway, it's good that she's okay." [[11069 司辰 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow. "That doesn't sound right. You're the type who never does anything without a reason. I'd think it was normal for you to show up 30 minutes later." [[11070 东方阳 neutral]]
"Heh." Si Chen rolled his eyes at Dongfang Yang. "Su Tao and I are friends too, you know... Hey, hey, what's with that look?" [[11071 司辰 neutral]]
"You, you're not still thinking of chasing Su Tao, are you?" [[11072 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Si Chen weirdly, then laughed. "Si Chen, oh, Si Chen, I advise you to give up on that idea. You don't stand a chance." [[11073 东方阳 happy]]
Si Chen knew he didn't have a chance anymore. [[11074 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, he had never really been in love with Su Tao. Back when he had a small crush, he had already carved "Never Love Tao" on his back. [[11075 旁白 neutral]]
But he was confused about what Dongfang Yang meant. [[11076 旁白 neutral]]
So he easily baited Dongfang Yang. "Why do you think I don't have a chance?" [[11077 司辰 neutral]]
"Hahahaha!" Dongfang Yang laughed out loud, but then lowered his voice so he wouldn't wake Su Tao, revealing a victorious smile. "You probably don't know, do you? The person Su Tao cares about is me!" [[11078 东方阳 happy]]
He then put his hands on his hips, looking very proud. "And it's not just Su Tao. Chi Xiaocheng likes me too. You should just back off." [[11079 东方阳 happy]]
Hearing Dongfang Yang's truly sunny and boyish words, Si Chen was stunned. [[11080 旁白 neutral]]
This idiot still doesn't know that Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao are actually a thing? [[11081 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen hesitated for a moment, then said, "Dongfang Yang." [[11082 司辰 neutral]]
"What?" [[11083 东方阳 neutral]]
"Nothing, I just suddenly find you quite 'cute'." [[11084 司辰 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang: "???" [[11085 东方阳 neutral]]
Yes, 'cute' as an insult. [[11086 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen still didn't reveal the situation between Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao. [[11087 旁白 neutral]]
He thought that when Dongfang Yang found out the truth, his expression would be priceless. [[11088 旁白 neutral]]
The two chatted for a while, and soon a woman wearing a mink coat, with long, wavy hair and a gentle look in her eyes walked in from the door. [[11089 旁白 neutral]]
"So, this is the girl you need me to take care of?" [[11090 钱清 neutral]]
Qian Qing stood in front of Su Tao, and couldn't help but feel sorry for her when she saw her extremely pale face. [[11091 钱清 sad]]
Dongfang Yang nodded lightly. "I'll leave her to you. When she wakes up, please comfort her. I'll text you the details of what happened in a bit." [[11092 东方阳 neutral]]
"Alright, alright, you two should leave now." [[11093 钱清 neutral]]
After the two left, Qian Qing sighed helplessly. [[11094 旁白 neutral]]
She glanced at the paper Su Tao was holding, on which the two large words "Suicide Note" were clearly written. [[11095 旁白 neutral]]
"This matter is really complicated." [[11096 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at the small blanket covering Su Tao, then took off her own mink coat and put it on her. [[11097 旁白 neutral]]
After coaxing Da Wang out from the corner, she began to tidy up the messy room. [[11098 旁白 neutral]]
Based on the information Dongfang Yang provided, she could roughly guess what had happened. [[11099 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, when she walked into the bathroom and saw the bathtub full of crimson, she couldn't help but gasp. [[11100 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but glance back at the sleeping Su Tao. [[11101 旁白 neutral]]
If the hospital couldn't save that girl Xiaocheng... [[11102 旁白 neutral]]
"Will this girl be able to handle it when she wakes up?" [[11103 旁白 sad]]
