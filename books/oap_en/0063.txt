Chapter 63 Her Yandere Target is Su Tao! [[5535 旁白 neutral]]
In Chi Xiaocheng's original script, she was pretending to be a yandere. [[5536 旁白 neutral]]
She would act angry, blacken by about 3 times, and fight back and forth with Ye Liang. [[5537 旁白 neutral]]
Or she could blacken even more, making him feel a little intimidated, thereby temporarily ignoring his relationship with Su Tao, and incidentally harvesting a wave of emotion points. [[5538 旁白 neutral]]
This way, Ye Liang's attention would shift from Su Tao to herself. It would be best if it created an effect where he felt she was not to be trifled with, and even he, the son of destiny, had to retreat. [[5539 旁白 neutral]]
What Chi Xiaocheng wanted was to first change Ye Liang's perception of her. He had always disliked her and would constantly target her. [[5540 旁白 neutral]]
If he was scared, and she then deliberately showed estrangement from Su Tao, he might ignore her. [[5541 旁白 neutral]]
As long as he didn't interfere too much with her role as Su Tao's "ordinary female friend," Chi Xiaocheng would have plenty of opportunities to bend her cute Tao Tao. [[5542 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng never expected that the content performed by her intermediate acting skills would be something even she herself could barely maintain. [[5543 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be that Ye Liang's male lead halo was too strong, greatly weakening this skill? [[5544 旁白 neutral]]
Her acting in front of Su Tao and Si Chen was perfectly fine, and she was playing a yandere in both cases. Why was it full of flaws this time? [[5545 旁白 neutral]]
Plans couldn't keep up with changes. She didn't expect the system to malfunction at this critical moment! [[5546 旁白 neutral]]
Now the knife had slipped from her hand and stabbed him in the thigh. [[5547 旁白 neutral]]
Forget it, just faint. [[5548 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng peacefully closed her eyes. One hand was hidden under her abdomen due to her posture, ready to buy another small knife from the system store in case of an accident. [[5549 旁白 neutral]]
Alas, the system has failed me! [[5550 旁白 neutral]]
[...] [[5551 系统 neutral]]
[Host, the acting skill has actually been in use and has never stopped. You can't blame me for this!] [[5552 系统 neutral]]
"Then I was so angry, why didn't I blacken?" [[5553 池小橙 neutral]]
[I don't know!] [[5554 系统 neutral]]
And can feigned anger count as anger? [[5555 旁白 neutral]]
The system stated that it didn't want to take the blame. [[5556 旁白 neutral]]
Since things had come to this, Chi Xiaocheng's "fainting" after falling flat on the ground had become a fact. [[5557 旁白 neutral]]
And Ye Liang, after a burst of pain, gritted his teeth and looked at Chi Xiaocheng with lingering fear, "This guy, she's actually a yandere." [[5558 叶良 neutral]]
Ye Liang knew a little about anime, but not much. [[5559 旁白 neutral]]
He never thought of killing Chi Xiaocheng. At most, it was intimidation and control. But he didn't expect this guy to actually try to kill him. [[5560 旁白 neutral]]
She wants to keep me here forever? [[5561 旁白 neutral]]
Hiss— [[5562 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's anger gradually faded. The pain made him regain his rationality and focus on treatment. [[5563 旁白 neutral]]
After calling his private doctor and a simple treatment, he looked at Chi Xiaocheng, who was being helped to the sofa by the female doctor and was in a daze. [[5564 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang tapped his finger on the table, his eyes fixed on Chi Xiaocheng's cute face. [[5565 旁白 neutral]]
She doesn't look like it. [[5566 旁白 neutral]]
Not at all! [[5567 旁白 neutral]]
She was completely different from the Chi Xiaocheng he remembered, who was short, clumsy, and had more foundation on her face than dirt on his shoe soles. [[5568 旁白 neutral]]
If it weren't for the fact that it was too bizarre to think that way, Ye Liang would rather believe that this person had completely changed from the inside out, rather than face the reality that Chi Xiaocheng was a yandere beauty. [[5569 旁白 neutral]]
Humans are visual creatures. [[5570 旁白 neutral]]
When beauty surpasses a certain level. [[5571 旁白 neutral]]
Short becomes petite. [[5572 旁白 neutral]]
Clumsy becomes adorably clumsy. [[5573 旁白 neutral]]
The madness that repeatedly hindered her development with Su Tao transformed into an extreme, pathological love. [[5574 旁白 neutral]]
Is it because she likes me that she used to target Su Tao like that, and even broke off her sisterly relationship with Su Tao? [[5575 旁白 neutral]]
And now, why is she approaching Su Tao again? [[5576 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang kept thinking, his face still extremely gloomy. [[5577 旁白 neutral]]
One of the main reasons he fell in love with Su Tao was her unique temperament, different from ordinary girls. [[5578 旁白 neutral]]
Gentle, meticulous, strong, unyielding to money and power, sacred like a moonlight, making people look up to her, unable to harbor any blasphemous thoughts. [[5579 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang believed that such a girl was unique in the world. [[5580 旁白 neutral]]
But now, the person lying on the sofa in front of him was someone cherished by the girl he considered unique. [[5581 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at Chi Xiaocheng, Ye Liang's face grew even gloomier. [[5582 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang sat in the living room until dark. [[5583 旁白 neutral]]
No one knew what he was thinking, but Chi Xiaocheng felt immense pressure. [[5584 旁白 neutral]]
She had been waiting for Ye Liang to leave, then she would wake up and pretend nothing happened. [[5585 旁白 neutral]]
But this guy kept waiting for her to wake up. [[5586 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng held on for another half an hour, but had no choice but to wake up. As soon as she sat up, she met his deep eyes, which made her feel a little guilty. [[5587 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang raised an eyebrow, "From your expression, have you returned to normal? What, you don't want to keep me here?" [[5588 叶良 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head, not daring to speak. [[5589 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang snorted coldly, "Tell me, since you dislike Su Tao so much, what's your purpose in approaching her?" [[5590 叶良 angry]]
"Purpose?" Half of Chi Xiaocheng's eyes were covered by her bangs. She pretended to look sinisterly at Ye Liang, "Of course, it's to snatch her away from you!" [[5591 池小橙 neutral]]
"Snatch... snatch away?" [[5592 叶良 surprised]]
Ye Liang was stunned for a moment, as if he didn't understand what Chi Xiaocheng meant. [[5593 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng chuckled, "Yes, you care about Su Tao a lot, don't you? I'll snatch her away from you and make her my possession!" [[5594 池小橙 neutral]]
Ye Liang heard this and stood up with a "whoosh," "Snatch her away? You? A girl?" [[5595 叶良 angry]]
"So what? No matter what, you can't be with her!" [[5596 池小橙 angry]]
"Heh, hahahaha!" Ye Liang covered his face and laughed loudly, looking at Chi Xiaocheng mockingly, "You actually came up with such a method. Su Tao isn't that kind of girl. She'll only like me, and she'll definitely marry me in the future." [[5597 叶良 angry]]
"You..." [[5598 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's crimson eyes suddenly became deep, with a hint of madness spreading, "What did you say?!" [[5599 池小橙 angry]]
Her entire aura was completely different from before. It was as if if Ye Liang said one more word, Chi Xiaocheng would rush forward and fight him again! [[5600 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang himself didn't expect Chi Xiaocheng to react so strongly when Su Tao was mentioned. [[5601 旁白 neutral]]
I just mentioned her, and you look like you're about to blacken. [[5602 旁白 neutral]]
Do you like me that much? [[5603 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's eyes became even more complex. He was a little unsure how to deal with Chi Xiaocheng. [[5604 旁白 neutral]]
Warn her? [[5605 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at her, it seems useless no matter what. [[5606 旁白 neutral]]
Be harsh with her? [[5607 旁白 neutral]]
It would be fine if Su Tao didn't find out, but once Su Tao caught wind of it, their already strained relationship would probably completely break down. [[5608 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, if Dongfang Yang or Si Chen took advantage of the situation, Ye Liang would have no chance. [[5609 旁白 neutral]]
Hiss— [[5610 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe... just ignore her? [[5611 旁白 neutral]]
No, that won't do. I'm not sure what she'll do to Su Tao! [[5612 旁白 neutral]]
Even if she likes me, I must eliminate her. The dangerous factor of a yandere is still too great! [[5613 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's eyes became fierce. He stood up and tried to pressure Chi Xiaocheng, replying to her previous words, "I said, you stinky woman, stop thinking about Su Tao. She's mine!" [[5614 叶良 angry]]
His possessiveness towards Su Tao was no less than Chi Xiaocheng's. [[5615 旁白 neutral]]
However, this sentence was like a knife, piercing through a thin layer of Chi Xiaocheng's acting. [[5616 旁白 neutral]]
The emotions that had been hidden suddenly erupted. Her crimson eyes gradually turned into eerie and aggressive vertical pupils. [[5617 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang!" [[5618 池小橙 angry]]
With a "clink," Chi Xiaocheng grabbed the knife and took a step forward, stabbing directly towards Ye Liang's waist. [[5619 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did Ye Liang slowly react. [[5620 旁白 neutral]]
This guy, she was acting just now! [[5621 旁白 neutral]]
Her yandere target is Su Tao! [[5622 旁白 neutral]]
