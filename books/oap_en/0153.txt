Chapter 153: The Withering of the Flower of Life (Bonus chapter for all the readers who love this book) [[13491 旁白 neutral]]
Why, why, why. [[13492 苏桃 sad]]
Why are you ignoring me! [[13493 苏桃 sad]]
Ever since the memories from the basement, Chi Xiaocheng's love had always been overwhelming. Every time, it made her feel breathless. Su Tao knew this very well. [[13494 旁白 neutral]]
More than once, Chi Xiaocheng had forced her to say "I like you." Even just yesterday, she clearly remembered how deep and intense her passion was. [[13495 旁白 neutral]]
Why has it changed now? [[13496 苏桃 sad]]
Why aren't you responding to me? You were always the one to take the lead, right? You always made me breathless, right! [[13497 苏桃 sad]]
"An illusion. It must be an illusion I'm having. There's something wrong with my sense of touch. This... Xiaocheng isn't asleep. She should be responding to me..." [[13498 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao lowered her head again, murmuring these words over and over. [[13499 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang saw everything. [[13500 旁白 neutral]]
For the first time, the eyes of this proud and sunny young master turned so cold. [[13501 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at the building across the street, which was already empty. [[13502 旁白 neutral]]
The sniper, who came from nowhere, was definitely a professional. They took one shot, didn't care if it hit, and ran immediately after firing. [[13503 旁白 neutral]]
With Su Tao acting like this and Chi Xiaocheng collapsed in her arms, how could Dongfang Yang not realize what had happened? [[13504 旁白 neutral]]
This young girl who had a secret crush on him, who liked him but never dared to confess... had her life already faded away? [[13505 东方阳 sad]]
Even Su Tao had started to act strangely. [[13506 旁白 neutral]]
She started talking nonsense. [[13507 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't bear to watch and looked away, nodding at Professor Su who was standing by. [[13508 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su suppressed the shock in her eyes, took a deep breath, and walked over to Su Tao. "Miss Su, please let me see what's going on. We can't delay the rescue for even a moment." [[13509 苏教授 neutral]]
She reached out her hand, but Su Tao slapped it away. [[13510 旁白 neutral]]
"No one is taking my Xiaocheng away!" [[13511 苏桃 angry]]
She seemed to have gone a little mad. [[13512 旁白 neutral]]
Her hair was messy, her face pale and frightening. Her once beautiful eyes were full of bloodshot veins, and even her fair cheeks looked sallow in the sunlight. [[13513 旁白 neutral]]
Where was the beautiful campus goddess that everyone once admired? [[13514 旁白 neutral]]
Anyone who saw her would probably call her a madwoman. [[13515 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao kept her head down and pulled back the hand that was pressing on Chi Xiaocheng's chest. [[13516 旁白 neutral]]
She then brought her hand to her mouth. [[13517 旁白 neutral]]
"Wrong... wrong... Why is there a hole here? Xiaocheng should be whole." [[13518 苏桃 sad]]
"Wrong, wrong, wrong. Xiaocheng, please don't lie to me, okay?" [[13519 苏桃 sad]]
She stroked Chi Xiaocheng's lips and prepared to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation again to save her. [[13520 旁白 neutral]]
Her gray-black hair fell into the blood, like dark strands floating on water among fresh flowers, then fell down her wrist with her movements. [[13521 旁白 neutral]]
But its original gray-black color was now stained a heart-stopping red. [[13522 旁白 neutral]]
And she wore a strange smile, as if she were tasting some rare delicacy. [[13523 旁白 neutral]]
This scene made everyone present feel a chill down their spines. [[13524 旁白 neutral]]
Several security guards with weaker nerves took a step back in unison. [[13525 旁白 neutral]]
She's gone mad! [[13526 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at Su Tao, this word appeared in many people's minds. [[13527 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, Dongfang Yang couldn't watch anymore. He grabbed Su Tao's hand and shouted, trying to snap her out of her frenzied state, "Su Tao!" [[13528 东方阳 angry]]
The loud shout brought Su Tao back to her senses for a moment. [[13529 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang continued, "The most important thing now is to let Professor Su check on Chi Xiaocheng. No matter what, we need to get her to the hospital first. Do you know more than a doctor? We saved her last time, so it will definitely be fine this time!" [[13530 东方阳 neutral]]
His words were like a lifeline to Su Tao. [[13531 旁白 neutral]]
That's right. Last time, she also thought Xiaocheng had no chance, but the doctors saved her in the end. [[13532 旁白 neutral]]
It must be the same this time. [[13533 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly held Chi Xiaocheng and looked at Professor Su with hopeful eyes. "Professor Su, Xiaocheng is still alive, right? You can definitely cure her, right!" [[13534 苏桃 sad]]
But how could this time be the same as the last? [[13535 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su found it hard to meet Su Tao's gaze. [[13536 旁白 neutral]]
Last time, Chi Xiaocheng had subjectively wanted to die. She didn't understand medicine and thought that a small cut, like in the movies, would let her wait peacefully for the end. [[13537 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know that the human body protects itself in extreme situations, and her method was incomplete and improper. [[13538 旁白 neutral]]
But this time was different. [[13539 旁白 neutral]]
There was a blurry hole in her chest. [[13540 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, the sniper rifle didn't seem to be very powerful, or half of her body could have been blown away. [[13541 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, from a professional view, the wound was almost directly on her heart! [[13542 旁白 neutral]]
The probability of heart damage was extremely high! [[13543 旁白 neutral]]
As a doctor, this was the kind of hopeful look from family members that she feared the most. [[13544 旁白 neutral]]
She had no choice. She clenched her teeth, walked to Su Tao's side, and comforted her, "Miss Su, please wait on the side for now. I will do my absolute best!" [[13545 苏教授 neutral]]
But it was only her best. [[13546 旁白 neutral]]
She took Chi Xiaocheng, propped her up, and quickly called for other doctors to come over. [[13547 旁白 neutral]]
The fear was that the most critical time for treatment had already passed. [[13548 旁白 neutral]]
Rescue, transport to the hospital, admission to the emergency room—it was another long few hours. [[13549 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't sleep, but she also didn't say a word. [[13550 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang stayed by her side the whole time. The once cheerful boy's face was also pale. [[13551 旁白 neutral]]
The most proactive one was Si Chen. [[13552 旁白 neutral]]
He came to the hospital, saw that Chi Xiaocheng was still in the emergency room, and left quickly after saying, "I'm going to find the culprit." [[13553 司辰 neutral]]
He was arguably the one with the most distant relationship with Chi Xiaocheng. [[13554 旁白 neutral]]
But he also seemed to be the one who cared the most about whether she lived or died. [[13555 旁白 neutral]]
Time ticked by as doctors, drenched in sweat, rushed in and out of the emergency room. [[13556 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at Su Tao, who was sitting motionless on the chair with her head down, and couldn't help but ask, "Su Tao... are you still lucid?" [[13557 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao's head moved slightly. Her blood-stained hair had long since dried in the wind, which made it look even worse. [[13558 旁白 neutral]]
A hospital nutritionist brought lunch and, knowing the situation, tried to comfort her, "Miss Su, please have some porridge. You've been sitting here for hours without eating or drinking anything. You'll collapse first if you continue like this." [[13559 陌生人 neutral]]
Su Tao gently shook her head, still not speaking. [[13560 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang sighed. "I know how you feel, but you can't abuse yourself like this, right? Think positively. Chi Xiaocheng protected you because she didn't want you to get hurt. You should eat, drink the porridge, and get your strength back, just like last time, to welcome her when she wakes up." [[13561 东方阳 sad]]
Su Tao lifted her head numbly, her dry eyes having already run out of tears. "Really... can it be like last time? I'd rather that bullet had hit me!" [[13562 苏桃 sad]]
Twice. The first time, she almost lost Chi Xiaocheng. [[13563 旁白 neutral]]
But fate was on her side then. [[13564 旁白 neutral]]
But what about this second time? Would she be so lucky again? [[13565 旁白 sad]]
With a soft "dong," the light in the operating room went out, and the tightly closed doors slowly opened. [[13566 旁白 neutral]]
A brief flash of light appeared in Su Tao's eyes. She stumbled a few times but managed to force herself to stand up. [[13567 旁白 neutral]]
She practically threw herself at the sweat-covered Professor Su. "Professor Su... Xiaocheng, how is Xiaocheng!" [[13568 苏桃 sad]]
It must be, just like last time, that she was barely saved, and then she'll scold me, right? [[13569 旁白 neutral]]
However, Professor Su didn't speak, just kept her head slightly lowered. [[13570 旁白 neutral]]
The light that had sparked in Su Tao's eyes gradually dimmed. "Hey, Professor Su... you, you have to say something. Xiaocheng... how is she!" [[13571 苏桃 sad]]
Her last sentence was a choked sob. [[13572 旁白 sad]]
Professor Su lowered her head and clenched her fists tightly, only to release them in resignation. [[13573 旁白 sad]]
"I'm sorry." [[13574 苏教授 sad]]
The two quiet words echoed through the entire corridor. [[13575 旁白 sad]]
