Chapter 180: The Story from the Other Side of the Mirror [[15743 旁白 neutral]]
"Jumping into the river?" [[15744 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at the person next to her and saw a boy with short bangs who looked rather cheerful. He was holding an unopened bottle of beer, leaning dejectedly on the frozen iron railing. [[15745 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Su Tao's questioning voice, Wei Feng chuckled softly. "What, coming to the riverside so late on a snowy day? Don't tell me you're here to enjoy the night view. At this time of night, everyone is either sleeping with their partner or curled up playing games in an air-conditioned room." [[15746 韦峰 neutral]]
He lowered his head, staring at the gently flowing river mixed with ice. "If you're also thinking of jumping, miss, I can chat with you. If you're just passing by, then please go. I don't want to leave a bad impression on a stranger before I die." [[15747 韦峰 sad]]
"Besides, I don't want anyone trying to talk me out of it." [[15748 韦峰 sad]]
Sensing the boy's sadness, Su Tao knew she should persuade him not to jump, that suicide meant the end of everything. [[15749 旁白 neutral]]
But for some reason, she felt no impulse to persuade him at all. [[15750 旁白 neutral]]
She just stared blankly at the river water. "Do you think people meet in heaven or hell after they die? If they can't be together in this life, is there a chance to meet in the next?" [[15751 苏桃 sad]]
Wei Feng looked at Su Tao in shock. "Could it be that you too..." [[15752 韦峰 sad]]
"Too?" Su Tao's eyes remained heavy and sad, as if she were just trying to find something to talk about to forget her own painful memories. "Why do you want to jump?" [[15753 苏桃 sad]]
Wei Feng sighed. "I had my heart broken." [[15754 韦峰 sad]]
"Heartbroken..." [[15755 苏桃 sad]]
To suffer so much from love that you wanted to kill yourself? [[15756 旁白 neutral]]
There was a time when she had also thought about just going with Chi Xiaocheng. [[15757 旁白 sad]]
Regret and pain surrounded her. For the past few days, she had been trying to numb herself, forcing herself to accept a life without Xiaocheng. [[15758 旁白 sad]]
But no matter how she tried to hide, the feeling followed her like a shadow. [[15759 旁白 sad]]
Whenever she met someone she knew, they would ask, "Where's your Xiaocheng? How come I haven't seen her?" [[15760 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps in the eyes of others, she and Xiaocheng were already inseparable. [[15761 旁白 sad]]
Was this man also suffering because of love? [[15762 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be that his girlfriend, like Xiaocheng, had a love so heavy that it was suffocating? [[15763 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, she still didn't understand what it really meant to like someone. [[15764 旁白 sad]]
As if she had found a model for comparison, Su Tao said to Wei Feng with some interest, "I want to hear your story." [[15765 苏桃 neutral]]
"Hear what?" [[15766 韦峰 neutral]]
"About you and your girlfriend, and why you broke up." [[15767 苏桃 neutral]]
The corner of Wei Feng's mouth twitched. [[15768 旁白 neutral]]
He never imagined that, even as he was about to kill himself, someone would want to pick at his old wounds. [[15769 旁白 neutral]]
But... it didn't matter. It was just a final chat. No one in this world cared about him anyway, so it didn't matter when he died. [[15770 旁白 sad]]
Wei Feng took a sip of the ice-cold beer, his eyes drifting into his memories. [[15771 韦峰 sad]]
"I grew up without parents. After my grandfather, who took care of me, passed away when I was six, I've been living on my own. I managed to get through school with subsidies and help from kind people." [[15772 韦峰 sad]]
"I wanted to work hard, but I found out I wasn't very smart. I went to a regular middle school and just missed getting into a top high school. After three years of hard work, I barely made it into a second-tier university. Since there were no good schools to choose from, I went to a decent vocational college." [[15773 韦峰 sad]]
"Life was a bit dull. I was just getting by, spacing out in class, eating after class, and playing games when I had nothing to do. I always waited until the last minute to turn in my homework." [[15774 韦峰 sad]]
"A very ordinary and bland life, isn't it?" [[15775 韦峰 sad]]
Wei Feng gave a self-deprecating laugh, then smiled as he recalled, "But even someone as ordinary and unremarkable as me met someone I liked." [[15776 韦峰 happy]]
"It was in the first semester of my second year. She was a new freshman. One night, I fell while playing basketball, and she helped me to the infirmary. At that moment, I felt she was the most important person in my life." [[15777 韦峰 happy]]
"She was average-looking, the kind of girl who looks pleasant without makeup but isn't stunning. But I just really liked her." [[15778 韦峰 happy]]
"I started to change and improve myself. I started to pursue her." [[15779 韦峰 happy]]
"I chatted with her on WeChat and kept creating 'accidental' meetings at school. Once we got a bit closer, I started pursuing her seriously—buying her breakfast, bringing her water, and taking care of her when she was sick. I was like a devoted admirer." [[15780 韦峰 happy]]
"After pursuing her for six months, I confessed, and she said yes. I felt like that was the happiest moment of my life." [[15781 韦峰 happy]]
"But we were together for less than half a year. Yesterday, we had a huge fight and broke up." [[15782 韦峰 sad]]
He took another big gulp of beer, glanced at Su Tao's profile in the darkness, and asked, "Do you know why we broke up?" [[15783 韦峰 sad]]
Su Tao shook her head. "Did she cheat on you?" [[15784 苏桃 neutral]]
"I guess you could say that." Wei Feng sighed heavily. "She said she couldn't handle my strong need for control and possession, that my love for her was too overwhelming, and that she couldn't return it." [[15785 韦峰 sad]]
"You know, I was pursuing her with marriage in mind. I thought I could be with my first love until the end." [[15786 韦峰 sad]]
"From school uniforms to a wedding dress, what a romantic story." [[15787 韦峰 sad]]
"But she... she was just in it for fun, to play around." [[15788 韦峰 sad]]
As Wei Feng spoke, he began to choke up. "She just wanted to be in a relationship, to experience the sweet and wonderful feeling of being together. She wanted something easy and normal." [[15789 韦峰 sad]]
"But in the end, she felt my love was too heavy, too possessive." [[15790 韦峰 sad]]
"But we were boyfriend and girlfriend, a couple!" [[15791 韦峰 angry]]
Tears streamed down Wei Feng's face; a grown man crying so miserably. "I'm not even that possessive. I don't stop her from being friends with other guys. I only remind her when I feel a line is being crossed. Since we're a couple, she shouldn't get too close to other guys. It makes my heart ache." [[15792 韦峰 sad]]
"Isn't that normal for a couple?" [[15793 韦峰 sad]]
"I brought her food and drinks every day, I tried to give her whatever she wanted, I told her I liked her every day, and I did all sorts of things with her. I like her, so is it wrong to be a little clingy?" [[15794 韦峰 sad]]
"She also said she wanted some distance, that she wished I could be more normal. Can there be such a thing as too much love for someone?!" [[15795 韦峰 angry]]
"I could give her all my love, so why did she hate me for it?" [[15796 韦峰 sad]]
"In the end, right before we broke up, some player was harassing her, almost putting his arm around her waist, even trying to touch her chest. I punched the guy to protect her." [[15797 韦峰 angry]]
"And then, that same night, she broke up with me." [[15798 韦峰 sad]]
"And got together with that player." [[15799 韦峰 sad]]
Wei Feng wiped away his tears and looked at Su Tao miserably. "I'm ridiculous, aren't I?" [[15800 韦峰 sad]]
Su Tao opened her mouth, then lowered her eyes. [[15801 旁白 neutral]]
Her dark hair hid half of her face. [[15802 旁白 neutral]]
"In the end, did she ever love you?" [[15803 苏桃 sad]]
