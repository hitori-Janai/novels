Chapter 233: Su Tao's Yandere Development Plan [[20038 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the hospital room window, moonlight streamed in through the white curtains. [[20039 旁白 neutral]]
The overhead light mixed with the moonlight, casting a soft, cool glow like silk. The dappled light illuminated Chi Xiaocheng's face. [[20040 旁白 neutral]]
She looked down with a smile on her lips. Her brown hair fell messily over her shoulders, but Chi Xiaocheng had no intention of fixing it. Instead, she quietly waited for a reply from the person on the other end of the phone. [[20041 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng had been busy for over a month and a half treating a "yandere patient." Because of this, she had barely spoken with Su Tao. Their occasional small talk was just to maintain their relationship and prevent them from growing distant. [[20042 旁白 neutral]]
An alias that had been inactive for so long naturally had to make an appearance at a critical moment. [[20043 池小橙 neutral]]
The "yandere patient" from before was already cured. Now it was time to treat another one. [[20044 池小橙 neutral]]
She sat alone on the hospital bed. The door was shut tight, and most of the medical instruments that had been attached to her were removed. Plus, there were no surveillance cameras here. [[20045 旁白 neutral]]
With no one around, where were the signs of her memory confusion? [[20046 旁白 neutral]]
That's right. [[20047 池小橙 neutral]]
From the very beginning, the memory confusion was all an act! [[20048 池小橙 happy]]
After the System's tip last time, Chi Xiaocheng understood that complete amnesia was very uncontrollable. If something unexpected happened, she wouldn't be able to handle it at all. [[20049 旁白 neutral]]
Before that, memory confusion was the advanced method she had come up with. It could be passed off as amnesia, but she could also control the situation as she wished. [[20050 旁白 neutral]]
But she knew that thinking and doing were two different things. She had to deceive Professor Su, the psychologist who might come to examine her, and even a future hypnotist who might try to awaken her, among other unknown situations. [[20051 旁白 neutral]]
Intermediate Acting was not quite enough. [[20052 池小橙 neutral]]
But to upgrade, she had to rely on the lottery, and she could only level up by getting the same skill again. Although her luck was decent, she felt the System was secretly changing the drop rates, and she didn't have many Emotion Points to begin with. [[20053 旁白 neutral]]
With just over 4000 points, she had to set aside 3000 to buy Snow White's poison apple. [[20054 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't afford to gamble. [[20055 池小橙 sad]]
After searching for a while, Chi Xiaocheng finally found what she was looking for. [[20056 旁白 neutral]]
[Temporary Acting Card: 300 Emotion Points] [[20057 系统 neutral]]
[Use to gain a temporary Intermediate Acting skill. Duration: until the performance ends.] [[20058 系统 neutral]]
It seemed like an ordinary card, but Chi Xiaocheng discovered that this Acting Card could actually stack with her own Intermediate Acting skill! [[20059 旁白 happy]]
Intermediate Acting + Intermediate Acting = Ultimate Acting! [[20060 池小橙 happy]]
Although it was expensive and the duration was short, it was more than enough to deal with the doctors. With Ultimate Acting, Chi Xiaocheng felt she wouldn't even break character in front of Si Chen's startup password. [[20061 旁白 neutral]]
But acting alone wasn't enough to suppress the urge to be close with Taotao after waking up, so she bought an Emotion Numbing Pill for herself. [[20062 旁白 neutral]]
[Emotion Numbing Pill: 200 Emotion Points] [[20063 系统 neutral]]
[Can numb feelings for a single person or a single emotion. Duration: 1 day.] [[20064 系统 neutral]]
Targeting a single person was perfect for choosing Su Tao. So, by spending over 500 Emotion Points daily, Chi Xiaocheng successfully played the role of an amnesiac "Little Cheng" who had confused memories and disliked her. [[20065 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted Su Tao to care more about her, to pay more attention to her. [[20066 池小橙 neutral]]
The Favorability score for 'like' was increasing too slowly. During this time, the Possessiveness score kept dropping, and she would still seek out others. Not just boys, but even girls could be influenced by Su Tao's protagonist halo. [[20067 旁白 neutral]]
For example, that Tang Tang. [[20068 旁白 neutral]]
Or someone in the future who might appear and influence Su Tao. [[20069 旁白 neutral]]
Since Favorability won't go up, then let's raise Possessiveness! [[20070 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had asked the System about the metrics for each type of favorability. [[20071 旁白 neutral]]
For romantic favorability, 60 points just means 'a little like', commonly known as developing feelings. [[20072 旁白 neutral]]
Setting aside the matter between her and Su Tao, for a regular man and woman, the chances of a successful confession are only decent above 80 points. [[20073 旁白 neutral]]
At 90, they could be called lovers. [[20074 旁白 neutral]]
95, soulmates. [[20075 旁白 neutral]]
100, undying love. [[20076 旁白 neutral]]
The higher the favorability, the harder it is to raise. [[20077 旁白 neutral]]
And Possessiveness worked the same way. [[20078 旁白 neutral]]
Below 60, low. [[20079 旁白 neutral]]
60-80, a little possessive, and it increases slightly with the score. [[20080 旁白 neutral]]
Above 80, they can't stand seeing the person they like getting along too well with others. [[20081 旁白 neutral]]
At 90, there are signs of becoming a yandere. At this stage, it's no longer about "can't stand it," but "not allowed!" [[20082 旁白 neutral]]
She is not allowed to have overly intimate contact with others. If discovered, something terrible might happen. [[20083 旁白 neutral]]
At 95, not quite a yandere, but if the person she likes isn't paying attention to her and is instead distracted, a 'dark room' is guaranteed. [[20084 旁白 neutral]]
Once Possessiveness reaches 100, that person truly becomes a yandere! [[20085 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng always felt that the yandere she played with her Intermediate Acting was in the 90-95 range—a little bit yandere, but not completely. [[20086 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, it's not that reaching 100 means going insane. Yanderes are not without reason; their thinking just becomes more extreme due to various factors. [[20087 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng's goal was to raise Su Tao's Possessiveness to about 90 points! [[20088 旁白 neutral]]
Her possessiveness would be maxed out, but she wouldn't become a yandere. That way, she would be normal but also have eyes only for her. Their happy future life would only have the two of them. [[20089 旁白 happy]]
What a beautiful picture, isn't it? [[20090 池小橙 happy]]
Of course, she wasn't without moments of weakness. She had given Su Tao two choices. If Taotao had chosen to wake her up and accept her yandere side, this plan would have been abandoned. [[20091 旁白 neutral]]
She would just cultivate Su Tao's yandere favorability a little. [[20092 旁白 neutral]]
Getting it to around 80, with a good amount of possessiveness, would be enough. [[20093 旁白 neutral]]
But Taotao, you are perfect in every way, except for your slowness in matters of the heart. It's so disappointing. [[20094 池小橙 sad]]
My pretending to be a yandere is also a sign of my love for you. Why won't you accept this kind of love from me? [[20095 池小橙 sad]]
Her phone buzzed. A message from Su Tao arrived for Dr. Cheng's account, "Dr. Cheng, you finally replied! Excuse me for asking, but are you finished with your work?" [[20096 苏桃 happy]]
"Of course." Chi Xiaocheng typed back, "The yandere patient I was treating, I've spent the last two months trying to cure her. I have to tell you some good news, yandere can be cured!" [[20097 池小橙 happy]]
"Really?!" Su Tao was so excited she typed a typo, "Dr. Chen, can yandere really be cured? So you've been busy with that girl for two months! Can you tell me more about it?" [[20098 苏桃 happy]]
Taotao: "Sorry, I meant Dr. Cheng. I was too excited and made a typo." [[20099 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Of course. I always thought yandere was an extreme condition and hard to treat. But it's not impossible to help her become normal and less extreme. However, this method can't be used by just anyone." [[20100 池小橙 neutral]]
Taotao: "Please, tell me everything!" [[20101 苏桃 happy]]
Dr. Cheng: "Alright, Miss Taotao, we know each other well enough, and your friend Orange is a bit special. This method might actually work for you. But I must tell you one precondition for treating a yandere." [[20102 池小橙 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "You must satisfy all of her needs within a certain period of time!" [[20103 池小橙 neutral]]
