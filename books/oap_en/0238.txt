Chapter 238: A Moment of Warmth [[20404 旁白 neutral]]
The video chat had already started. Chi Xiaocheng warmly greeted her father and mother, and then they talked about things happening in her life and at school. [[20405 旁白 neutral]]
After saying hello, Su Tao's mind was no longer on the video chat. [[20406 旁白 neutral]]
She tried to keep her breathing steady, greedily enjoying the warmth of the embrace. The arm wrapped around her slender waist felt a little restless. [[20407 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to hold tighter, to nuzzle closer, but after a few trembling and stiffening moments, she didn't dare to make another move. [[20408 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze remained on the video screen, a slightly stiff, faint smile on her face. Because they were so close, strands of Chi Xiaocheng's hair brushed against her cheek and neck. [[20409 旁白 neutral]]
It tickled a little. [[20410 旁白 neutral]]
If she lowered her gaze just a little, she could see that cute face, full of collagen and without a trace of makeup. [[20411 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to reach out and touch it. [[20412 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[20413 旁白 neutral]]
They were on a video call, and she couldn't make Xiaocheng angry, or the favorability she had worked so hard to regain would drop again. [[20414 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng was still chatting with her parents when she noticed Su Tao staring into space. Chi Xiaocheng gave her a light nudge with her elbow, pulling her back. "I'm asking you a question, what are you spacing out for?" [[20415 池小橙 neutral]]
"Huh?" Su Tao snapped back to reality, scratching her head in embarrassment. "I... I wasn't paying attention. What were Uncle and Auntie saying?" [[20416 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi's mother still had a kind look on her face. "I was just asking if Xiaocheng has been any trouble for you lately. This girl is always such a handful." [[20417 池母 happy]]
Hearing this, Su Tao glanced down for a second. [[20418 旁白 neutral]]
Her eyes met Chi Xiaocheng's, which held a hint of a threat. [[20419 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she was saying, "If you dare say the wrong thing... Hmph, you're dead!" [[20420 旁白 angry]]
Su Tao smiled and said to Chi's mother naturally, "Auntie, you're overthinking it. Xiaocheng has been very well-behaved. She even leaves a light on for me in the entryway when I come home late. How could she possibly be any trouble?" [[20421 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng chimed in, "Exactly! And for a younger sister, a little trouble isn't really trouble, right?" [[20422 池小橙 happy]]
"You, don't think you can do whatever you want just because Taotao spoils you. You're old enough to know better, so be careful not to cause her any trouble, you hear?" [[20423 池母 happy]]
"I know, I know!" Chi Xiaocheng gestured for Su Tao to keep talking for a bit longer. [[20424 池小橙 happy]]
After a few more minutes, she took over the conversation. "Dad, Mom, you don't know, but my brother actually came back to Jiuzhou to see me a while ago. He's just stubborn and said he isn't planning on coming home for the New Year." [[20425 池小橙 neutral]]
"He's very good to me. How could an older brother bully his little sister?" [[20426 池小橙 happy]]
"Are you asking about me and Sister Su Tao? For the New Year... if I can get out of bed and walk normally by then, and I don't need to be hospitalized, I think we'll go back." [[20427 池小橙 neutral]]
This time, Chi Xiaocheng chatted with her father and mother for nearly an hour. [[20428 旁白 neutral]]
Having always been alone, she cherished this family connection. [[20429 旁白 happy]]
Whether it was her parents or her brother Chi Song, she could feel a deep sense of love from them. [[20430 旁白 happy]]
Meanwhile, Su Tao had completely become a "seat," listening to Chi Xiaocheng chat on and on, feeling the warmth in her arms as her thoughts drifted. [[20431 旁白 neutral]]
The video call is about to end. Xiaocheng will definitely make me leave again, right? [[20432 旁白 sad]]
Even though she's forgiven me, didn't she also say she feels uncomfortable being with me? [[20433 旁白 sad]]
Even if we can slowly mend our relationship, it will probably be a long time before I can hold her like this again, right? [[20434 旁白 sad]]
Half a month? [[20435 旁白 sad]]
Or a whole month? [[20436 旁白 sad]]
The healing process is long, unless I can awaken her memories immediately, make her remember the past, the pain, and me. [[20437 旁白 sad]]
But I still want to hold Xiaocheng... [[20438 旁白 sad]]
Just a little longer, just a little longer is all I ask. [[20439 旁白 sad]]
Can this video call last a little longer? [[20440 旁白 sad]]
She prayed in her heart, hoping that Chi's father and mother would say more, but such prayers were useless. Chi Xiaocheng was weak and needed to sleep early. [[20441 旁白 sad]]
The two elders chatted for over half an hour, and they were relieved to know how the two girls were doing. But all conversations must eventually come to an end. [[20442 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, Chi Xiaocheng had also been trying to find topics, making things up when there was nothing left to say, with her telling the stories and her parents listening. [[20443 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't really have that much of a desire to share. [[20444 旁白 neutral]]
It's just that... she also wanted to stay in this embrace a little longer. [[20445 旁白 happy]]
It was warm, comfortable, soft, and filled with the scent of Taotao. [[20446 旁白 happy]]
But she couldn't break character. Right now, she wasn't supposed to like Taotao this way, so... if this video call lasted a little longer, maybe she could rely on Taotao for a little while more. [[20447 旁白 neutral]]
They were both thinking the same thing, but neither said it, and neither knew what the other was thinking. [[20448 旁白 neutral]]
It's been a few days since I wore the status glasses. I wonder what Su Tao's various favorability levels are now. [[20449 旁白 neutral]]
My behavior these past few days, being hot and cold with her, should have brought the possession favorability back to a passing level, right? [[20450 旁白 neutral]]
As she was thinking, the long video call was about to end. Chi's father and mother kept glancing at the door, as if they had something to do. Meanwhile, Ah Cai, the big yellow dog at home, kept barking. [[20451 旁白 neutral]]
It wanted to poke its head toward the screen but didn't dare to put its dirty paws on the bed. [[20452 旁白 neutral]]
After a few final words of concern about her health, the call ended. [[20453 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng let out a soft sigh. [[20454 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze went blank for a moment, then quickly returned to normal. [[20455 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to pull away from this gentle embrace, so she lightly patted the arm Su Tao had around her waist. "The video call is over, you can let go now." [[20456 池小橙 neutral]]
Her intermediate acting skills kicked in. Even though her voice no longer had its previous distance, it became flat. [[20457 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[20458 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't get a response from Su Tao. [[20459 旁白 neutral]]
Leaning slightly, Su Tao's previously upright body suddenly slumped forward, her chin resting on Chi Xiaocheng's shoulder, her cheek pressing against hers. [[20460 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of even breathing came through, her long eyelashes resting on closed eyes. [[20461 旁白 neutral]]
—She was asleep. [[20462 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's unconscious action told Chi Xiaocheng these two words. [[20463 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's hand, which was about to joyfully shake her awake, suddenly froze. [[20464 旁白 neutral]]
After a long silence, she heard nothing. [[20465 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's heart began to beat faster, and the palms of the hands holding her had, at some point, become slightly sweaty. [[20466 旁白 sad]]
She was pretending to be asleep. [[20467 旁白 neutral]]
It was a clumsy method, but somewhat effective. [[20468 旁白 neutral]]
How despicable, Su Tao. [[20469 旁白 sad]]
Inside, she felt a trace of self-loathing. [[20470 旁白 sad]]
To use such a method to hold onto Xiaocheng, even though her confused memories made her dislike me and feel uncomfortable, yet I still held onto her so forcefully. [[20471 旁白 sad]]
I only wanted to hold her for a little while, but I greedily wanted it to last the whole night. [[20472 旁白 sad]]
But... [[20473 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng, please don't wake me up, okay? [[20474 旁白 sad]]
I still hope we can go back to how things were before, even if you don't call me Taotao anymore, even if you say I make you uncomfortable, even if you hate me. [[20475 旁白 sad]]
I still want to hold you just like I used to. [[20476 旁白 sad]]
Her breathing started to become a little rapid. [[20477 旁白 sad]]
Then, the young woman heard a soft sigh by her ear. "Forget it, just this once." [[20478 池小橙 happy]]
It was unclear if Chi Xiaocheng's words were for herself or for Su Tao. [[20479 旁白 neutral]]
She could faintly feel the accelerating heartbeat behind her. [[20480 旁白 happy]]
But... [[20481 旁白 neutral]]
This is good too. [[20482 旁白 happy]]
I also want to fall asleep being held by you. [[20483 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng lifted her head slightly. "The air conditioner is a little bit low." [[20484 池小橙 neutral]]
However, it didn't feel cold at all. [[20485 旁白 happy]]
Muttering softly, she leaned back into Su Tao's embrace. [[20486 旁白 happy]]
The embrace tightened slightly. [[20487 旁白 happy]]
The hair of the two girls fell and tangled together gently. [[20488 旁白 happy]]
