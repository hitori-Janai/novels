Chapter 147: Another Timeline (Bonus update for the Gugu who brings hope) [[12939 旁白 neutral]]
A basement, restraints, a knife, and being forced to say "I love you" for the first time... [[12940 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt she would never forget this scene, even in death. [[12941 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, she thought Chi Xiaocheng was going to stab her, but then came a shocking twist. [[12942 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng actually confessed her love! [[12943 旁白 neutral]]
My childhood friend, my sister, my best friend, has been secretly in love with me for over ten years? [[12944 苏桃 neutral]]
After that, she showed a hidden yandere personality, turning her peaceful life into a mess. [[12945 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had wondered more than once, what would her life be like if Chi Xiaocheng wasn't a yandere? [[12946 旁白 neutral]]
Would she not have to endure this heavy love every moment? [[12947 苏桃 neutral]]
"Having this dream again... is it telling me that there's only one possible ending?" [[12948 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng had killed everyone. [[12949 旁白 neutral]]
For my sake. [[12950 旁白 neutral]]
However, to Su Tao's surprise, when Chi Xiaocheng sat on the bed, she didn't confess with red eyes like last time. [[12951 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, while crying, she raised the knife and stabbed it hard into the face of the dream Su Tao. [[12952 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao watched in disbelief, her pupils shrinking. [[12953 旁白 neutral]]
Doesn't Xiaocheng like me? [[12954 苏桃 sad]]
Doesn't she hate Ye Liang? [[12955 苏桃 neutral]]
Why is she attacking the me in the dream, slashing my face with a knife? Does she want to kill me? [[12956 苏桃 sad]]
If so, why is she crying so painfully? [[12957 苏桃 neutral]]
The knife left marks on her face. The dream Su Tao was tied to the bed, screaming and struggling in pain. [[12958 旁白 neutral]]
However, not only did Chi Xiaocheng not stop, she became even more intense. [[12959 旁白 neutral]]
She ruined her face, then stabbed her in the chest. [[12960 旁白 neutral]]
But the tears she shed and the pain on her face were no less than the dream Su Tao's. [[12961 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao herself got much closer and heard Chi Xiaocheng murmuring. [[12962 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang likes your face. If I ruin your face, he will definitely stop bothering you." [[12963 池小橙 sad]]
"As long as you become ugly, he will surely give up." [[12964 池小橙 sad]]
"This way, you won't get hurt because of Ye Liang." [[12965 池小橙 sad]]
"I'm sorry, Taotao. No matter what you become in the future, I will always be by your side." [[12966 池小橙 sad]]
"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." [[12967 池小橙 sad]]
The painful murmurs from her lips reminded Su Tao of the content of the previous dream. [[12968 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had a strange dream and believed that Ye Liang would definitely hurt her, so she tried to stop it in various ways. [[12969 旁白 neutral]]
In this basement, this time, she didn't confess her feelings like the last time. [[12970 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't become a yandere either. [[12971 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she did things her own way, a bit clumsily, and didn't dare to tell her. [[12972 旁白 neutral]]
This was a different ending from the last dream! [[12973 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao realized this at once, but then she began to fear what would happen next. [[12974 旁白 neutral]]
What would happen to a Chi Xiaocheng who treated her like this? [[12975 苏桃 neutral]]
Before long, Ye Liang's bodyguard in a suit arrived first. [[12976 旁白 neutral]]
He pushed Chi Xiaocheng aside, rescuing her while also letting Chi Xiaocheng escape through a hidden door. [[12977 旁白 neutral]]
After that, what happened? [[12978 苏桃 neutral]]
Ye Liang arrived, as angry at Chi Xiaocheng as ever. But unlike reality, in the dream, her face was already ruined, and she had fainted from the pain. [[12979 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, the dream shifted to when she woke up. [[12980 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang told her many bad things Chi Xiaocheng had done, saying he would get revenge for her and would definitely teach Chi Xiaocheng a lesson. [[12981 旁白 neutral]]
In the dream, she hesitated. She still believed that Chi Xiaocheng could be saved. [[12982 旁白 neutral]]
This time, it might just be a deeper misunderstanding. [[12983 旁白 neutral]]
But after months of arguing, things were still unclear. Ye Liang kept pushing, and the her in the dream didn't know what to do, only asking Ye Liang not to hurt Chi Xiaocheng for now. [[12984 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was very obedient and told her about Chi Xiaocheng's various matters, saying he had only temporarily pacified Chi Xiaocheng and hadn't done anything to her. [[12985 旁白 neutral]]
But she herself was following Chi Xiaocheng, and it was not at all as Ye Liang had said. [[12986 旁白 neutral]]
To escape from Ye Liang's men, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't even go home. She either hid in a simple, dilapidated, abandoned hut or under a bridge. [[12987 旁白 neutral]]
But how could an ordinary person like her escape from the well-connected Ye Liang? [[12988 旁白 neutral]]
There were cameras everywhere, and people searching everywhere. [[12989 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng cut her own face to avoid being caught. She slept during the day and moved at night. She couldn't do anything but try to get into the hospital one more time. [[12990 旁白 neutral]]
To see the already awakened Su Tao. [[12991 旁白 neutral]]
To tell Su Tao that Ye Liang was very dangerous. [[12992 旁白 neutral]]
Can a person really be so persistent because of a dream? [[12993 苏桃 neutral]]
If it weren't for Chi Xiaocheng's interference, if she hadn't seen Ye Liang's true nature in the snow, Su Tao would never have thought Ye Liang was that kind of person. [[12994 旁白 neutral]]
Just like now, she was following Ye Liang as an observer. [[12995 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Chi Xiaocheng had said, with her face ruined, she was just an ugly duckling without her looks. [[12996 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang made it clear in his conversations with others that he no longer liked her, but because of her father abroad, Ye Liang still focused his attention on her. [[12997 旁白 neutral]]
He pretended to like her. [[12998 旁白 neutral]]
And during her hospital stay, he constantly spoke ill of Chi Xiaocheng. [[12999 旁白 neutral]]
He forged various proofs that Chi Xiaocheng "hated" her, Su Tao. [[13000 旁白 neutral]]
Gradually, the Su Tao in the dream began to wake up. [[13001 旁白 neutral]]
But outside the dream, Su Tao, the observer, couldn't believe that this would be the outcome if Chi Xiaocheng hadn't become a yandere. [[13002 旁白 sad]]
"Would I give up on Xiaocheng because of Ye Liang?" [[13003 苏桃 sad]]
"That's absolutely impossible, right?" [[13004 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao murmured, asking the her in the dream. [[13005 旁白 neutral]]
It was more like she was asking her current self. [[13006 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she fell silent. [[13007 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the yandere Xiaocheng now, is this considered giving up? [[13008 苏桃 sad]]
She thought in silence, but the dream didn't end. [[13009 旁白 neutral]]
After much effort, Chi Xiaocheng was covered in injuries. Without Su Tao and constantly being hunted by Ye Liang, she was like a stray dog on the street. [[13010 旁白 sad]]
Anyone could come and kick her. [[13011 旁白 sad]]
But she didn't give up. [[13012 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to see her Taotao. [[13013 池小橙 sad]]
She wanted to apologize for ruining her face. [[13014 池小橙 sad]]
She wanted to tell Taotao that Ye Liang was really dangerous. [[13015 池小橙 sad]]
From Su Tao's god-like perspective, Ye Liang was undoubtedly a villain. He approached her for her looks, and wanted to abandon her after her face was ruined. [[13016 旁白 angry]]
After finding out that her father abroad had some power, he put on a loving smile again, being two-faced. [[13017 旁白 angry]]
In the dream, she was always in the hospital and couldn't contact Chi Xiaocheng. All information came from Ye Liang, and she rarely even saw Dongfang Yang. [[13018 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, through relentless effort, Chi Xiaocheng found a chance. She crawled out of a filthy sewer and into the hospital. [[13019 旁白 neutral]]
But she was not the protagonist, after all. [[13020 旁白 sad]]
She was just a side character destined to die. [[13021 旁白 sad]]
A character whose role was to advance the plot for Su Tao. [[13022 旁白 sad]]
A chess piece in the hands of the world's will. [[13023 旁白 sad]]
She entered the hospital, looking for Su Tao's room with urgency and anticipation, only to be caught by Ye Liang. [[13024 旁白 sad]]
Intimidation, threats, inducement. [[13025 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang gave Chi Xiaocheng a chance to see Su Tao, but if she dared to say anything wrong, he would stop Su Tao's treatment, and even kill Su Tao! [[13026 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was just an ordinary person. It was already her limit to have escaped Ye Liang's pursuit and survived until now. [[13027 旁白 sad]]
She was truly scared. [[13028 池小橙 sad]]
Scared that Ye Liang would kill Su Tao. [[13029 池小橙 sad]]
Scared that Su Tao would end up with Ye Liang without knowing the truth. [[13030 池小橙 sad]]
Scared that Su Tao... would hate her. [[13031 池小橙 sad]]
And this was the only, and perhaps the last, time they would meet. [[13032 旁白 sad]]
