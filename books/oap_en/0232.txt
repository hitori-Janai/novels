Chapter 232: Letting Go of the Old, Welcoming the New [[19956 旁白 neutral]]
Actually, it wasn't that strange. Su Tao knew she was just overthinking. After all, not everyone was like Xiaocheng and liked girls. [[19957 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning just seemed like a normal girl with a sad past, who was a little obsessive and lonely. [[19958 旁白 neutral]]
But because Xiaocheng was giving her the cold shoulder, she couldn't help but assume the worst when she saw how nice Fang Ning was. [[19959 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao took a quiet breath and calmly looked away. [[19960 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't interrupt them. If she appeared now, it would only make things worse, not better. [[19961 旁白 neutral]]
Until the misunderstanding was resolved, Xiaocheng would continue to dislike her. [[19962 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao quietly left in the elevator. As she walked down the chilly street, she saw many people busy with a big cleaning. [[19963 旁白 neutral]]
"Since I have nothing to do, maybe I'll go home and clean the house today." [[19964 苏桃 neutral]]
She had been feeling down for a while, so she hadn't cleaned the house in a long time. [[19965 旁白 neutral]]
Trying to push thoughts of Fang Ning and Xiaocheng out of her mind, Su Tao shook her head. She decided to go home and feed Da Wang first. [[19966 旁白 neutral]]
But to her surprise, during the two days she was away, Da Wang had already found the hidden cat food. [[19967 旁白 neutral]]
The cabinet, which had only been lightly shut, was now open, and cat food was scattered everywhere. The once-tidy room was a complete mess. [[19968 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's mouth twitched. As she looked toward the window, her eyes met Da Wang's. [[19969 旁白 angry]]
The cat was holding a ball of yarn that it must have found somewhere, and its entire body was dirty. [[19970 旁白 neutral]]
The girl and the cat stared at each other for a moment. [[19971 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang jumped from the window onto the bed, leaving a trail of muddy paw prints on the quilt. A dangerous smile spread across Su Tao's face. [[19972 旁白 angry]]
"Da Wang, come here~" [[19973 苏桃 angry]]
Smiling, Su Tao crouched down and beckoned to Da Wang with her finger. [[19974 旁白 angry]]
Da Wang meowed and trotted happily over to Su Tao. [[19975 旁白 happy]]
And then... [[19976 旁白 neutral]]
With a swift move, Su Tao grabbed Da Wang by the scruff of its neck and twisted its ear. "You bad cat! Did you think you could destroy the house just because I was gone for two days?!" [[19977 苏桃 angry]]
"This is my house with Xiaocheng! She's going to use that quilt when she gets back!" [[19978 苏桃 angry]]
"How am I supposed to dry it in weather like this?" [[19979 苏桃 angry]]
"You've gone too far!" [[19980 苏桃 angry]]
After the scolding, the clever cat went to take a bath on its own. [[19981 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, she had already wanted to clean. [[19982 旁白 neutral]]
If she came home to a spotless house, Xiaocheng would be happy, right? [[19983 苏桃 happy]]
This was what it meant to let go of the old and welcome the new. [[19984 旁白 neutral]]
She rolled up her sleeves and tied her hair up high. She had hoped that the focus and exhaustion from work would help her forget about Chi Xiaocheng for a little while. [[19985 旁白 neutral]]
But as she tidied up, every item she found brought back memories. [[19986 旁白 sad]]
She remembered the good times they had. [[19987 旁白 sad]]
She remembered the painful things from the past. [[19988 旁白 sad]]
The fruit knife she kept in the drawer was still as bright as ever. [[19989 旁白 sad]]
That night, she didn't sleep at home. [[19990 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she went to the hospital. It had been three days since Chi Xiaocheng woke up. With a nurse's help, she could barely get out of bed and stand. [[19991 旁白 neutral]]
Her body was recovering very quickly. [[19992 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su approached Su Tao. "Miss Su, given Miss Chi's current condition, I think we can start trying to awaken her old memories. I wanted to ask what you think." [[19993 苏教授 neutral]]
"Me?" Su Tao paused. [[19994 苏桃 neutral]]
She hadn't decided whether to restore Xiaocheng's memories. [[19995 旁白 neutral]]
Even setting her own feelings aside, she didn't want Chi Xiaocheng to remember all the painful things. [[19996 旁白 sad]]
It was just like the story the old man had told. [[19997 旁白 neutral]]
She was afraid something bad would happen to Chi Xiaocheng. [[19998 旁白 sad]]
She asked Professor Su, "Does it have to be so soon?" [[19999 苏桃 neutral]]
"Well..." Professor Su hesitated. "Not necessarily, but with her current recovery speed, she should be able to leave the hospital for short walks before New Year's Eve. If things go well, she could even stay home for a day or two." [[20000 苏教授 neutral]]
"If she goes home, awakening her memories will become uncontrollable. After all, your shared home is probably the place with the most memories, right?" [[20001 苏教授 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lip and hesitated for a long time. "Can I have two more days to think? What if we first tell her that Ye Liang is dead?" [[20002 苏桃 neutral]]
"That could work. I'll have Dongfang Yang tell her tomorrow. As for you... I personally still think it's better if you don't see Miss Chi." [[20003 苏教授 neutral]]
Professor Su sighed softly. "Of course, this might be difficult for you, but I'm suggesting this as a doctor, considering Miss Chi's condition." [[20004 苏教授 neutral]]
If you really want to see her, I can't stop you. [[20005 旁白 neutral]]
Professor Su was silently conveying this thought. [[20006 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing her words, Su Tao forced a smile. "Don't worry, Professor Su, I understand. Xiaocheng's treatment comes first. For now, I'm happy just being able to see her occasionally." [[20007 苏桃 sad]]
After speaking, she lowered her head and whispered. [[20008 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes, I... I should be happy with this." [[20009 苏桃 sad]]
"By the way, Mr. Chi Song is here. You can talk with him." [[20010 苏教授 neutral]]
After saying that, Professor Su left Su Tao's room. [[20011 旁白 neutral]]
The good news was that Chi Xiaocheng's impression of Chi Song and Long Ge hadn't changed. With Su Tao gone from her memory, they were the ones who had saved her many times. [[20012 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao hid outside the window and saw them smiling as they chatted. [[20013 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng was very sweet. With just a few words, she made Long Ge rub his bald head and laugh heartily. [[20014 旁白 happy]]
Two tough guys from the streets, with scars and tattoos, and a frail little loli. Normally, it would be a scene that could be easily misunderstood. [[20015 旁白 neutral]]
But their simple, happy smiles made the moment feel very warm. [[20016 旁白 happy]]
The two men had different opinions about Chi Xiaocheng's memory. [[20017 旁白 neutral]]
Long Ge: "If remembering will only bring her pain, I think it's better to let Xiaocheng stay happy like this." [[20018 龙哥 neutral]]
Long Ge's thoughts were similar to Su Tao's. As he spoke in the hallway, he would occasionally glance back at Chi Xiaocheng's room. [[20019 旁白 neutral]]
However, when Chi Song spoke, he looked directly into Su Tao's eyes. "Although I'm also relieved that Xiaocheng is so happy now... I still want to see the two of you smiling together. No matter what you choose, your brother won't blame you." [[20020 池松 neutral]]
After speaking, Chi Song said his goodbyes. "Long Ge and I have to go back to Lizhi City. I won't be going back for the New Year... If you go back, please tell Mom I'm sorry." [[20021 池松 sad]]
"That's all for now." [[20022 池松 neutral]]
They came and left quickly. [[20023 旁白 neutral]]
For Chi Song, he didn't need to see his sister every day. [[20024 旁白 neutral]]
Just knowing she was okay gave him the motivation to keep going. [[20025 旁白 neutral]]
The next day, Dongfang Yang told her that Ye Liang was dead, trying to clear Su Tao's name in her memory. [[20026 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, hiding and watching from the window, saw that they were chatting happily. [[20027 旁白 happy]]
In the afternoon, Si Chen came to the hospital and also had a happy conversation with Chi Xiaocheng. [[20028 旁白 happy]]
Fang Ning, Dongfang Yang, Si Chen... [[20029 旁白 neutral]]
And then there was Xiaocheng. [[20030 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt like these people were leaving her one by one. [[20031 旁白 sad]]
Another night passed. There were five days left until New Year's Eve. [[20032 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was still on the rooftop, feeling the breeze and looking at the starry sky. "Maybe tomorrow I can finally apologize to Xiaocheng. But what will I do after that?" [[20033 苏桃 sad]]
Her phone vibrated gently in her pocket. [[20034 旁白 neutral]]
She casually took it out, and a hint of surprise appeared in her lost eyes. [[20035 旁白 happy]]
Dr. Cheng: "I've been so busy lately, I haven't had time to check my phone. Miss Taozi, has something happened?" [[20036 成医生 neutral]]
