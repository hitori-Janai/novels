Chapter 118: Twisted Love [[10409 旁白 neutral]]
Tears unknowingly slid down her cheeks. [[10410 旁白 sad]]
At this moment, Chi Xiaocheng felt her mind go blank from lack of oxygen, and waves of pain washed over her heart. [[10411 旁白 sad]]
Her doubts were answered. [[10412 旁白 neutral]]
No wonder she kept avoiding me. [[10413 池小橙 sad]]
No wonder she wouldn't accept my confession. [[10414 池小橙 sad]]
No wonder the more well-behaved I was these days, the further she pushed me away. [[10415 池小橙 sad]]
So it turns out she didn't really like me. [[10416 池小橙 sad]]
She just thought that since I was "cured," she didn't need to care about me anymore. [[10417 池小橙 sad]]
Yes, ever since that lucid dream, everything had become strange. [[10418 池小橙 sad]]
How could I forget? She was pretending to like me from the start, using it as an excuse to cure my "yandere" tendencies. [[10419 池小橙 sad]]
And from the beginning, I also wanted to use her female lead aura, pretending to be a yandere to protect myself. [[10420 池小橙 neutral]]
"And in the process, I actually went and fell for her, haha..." [[10421 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked up, tears streaming past the corners of her self-mocking lips. [[10422 旁白 sad]]
Once again, my humble efforts have turned to nothing. [[10423 池小橙 sad]]
What she cares about is that marriage contract! [[10424 池小橙 angry]]
"She even has a fiancé..." [[10425 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng gritted her teeth, forcing out those words with great difficulty. [[10426 旁白 angry]]
The phone call hadn't ended yet. Si Chen swallowed and asked from the other side, "Chi Xiaocheng, are you okay?" [[10427 司辰 neutral]]
"Okay?" Chi Xiaocheng replied coldly, "Of course, I'm great." [[10428 池小橙 angry]]
Si Chen: "It's good that you haven't lost your mind." [[10429 司辰 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng leaned against Chi Xiaocheng and whispered, "How about we ask Si Chen to explain what happened?" [[10430 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened her mouth and repeated the question. [[10431 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen said, "This happened a few days ago. Su Tao even hid it from me. If I hadn't been investigating her father today, I wouldn't have known about it." [[10432 司辰 neutral]]
"About three days ago, a guy named Xiao Ming came to Su Tao with half of a jade pendant. That half-pendant happened to be the only keepsake Su Tao always carried with her." [[10433 司辰 neutral]]
"At the same time, Xiao Ming also brought news about Su Tao's father being abroad. Besides the evidence of the jade pendant, he could also reveal many details about the mystery of Su Tao's childhood, which made him very credible." [[10434 司辰 neutral]]
"On top of that, there's the marriage contract." [[10435 司辰 neutral]]
"I'm not sure how the engagement was arranged, but I'm certain that almost all of this is true." [[10436 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen's tone was cold. "We absolutely cannot let that guy named Xiao become Su Tao's official fiancé, and we can't let him marry Su Tao, or our entire plan will fall apart!" [[10437 司辰 angry]]
For the past half-month, Si Chen had been very dissatisfied with Chi Xiaocheng's actions. [[10438 旁白 neutral]]
The rational, morbid, and ruthless Chi Xiaocheng seemed to have disappeared. [[10439 旁白 neutral]]
She had inexplicably become love-struck and had taken no action for half a month. [[10440 旁白 neutral]]
If she can't control Su Tao, how can she later borrow the power of her War God father? [[10441 司辰 angry]]
Now this Xiao guy shows up, and as a child from a large family, Si Chen knew all too well how much weight those engagements set by the older generation carried. [[10442 旁白 neutral]]
A hint of impatience crept into Si Chen's voice. "Chi Xiaocheng, I suggest you act quickly. It seems Dongfang Yang has already taken Su Tao to meet that fiancé." [[10443 司辰 angry]]
The word "fiancé" was mentioned again. [[10444 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's crimson eyes suddenly changed. [[10445 旁白 angry]]
They transformed into cat-like vertical pupils, emitting a faint red glow, fierce and terrifying. [[10446 旁白 angry]]
She hung up on Si Chen. [[10447 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly clenched her fists and stood up from the sofa. [[10448 旁白 angry]]
Dark Xiaocheng curled her lips into a smile. "So, are you going to accept my proposal?" [[10449 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"To possess Taotao, right?" [[10450 池小橙 neutral]]
"That's right." Dark Xiaocheng flicked her hair. "Just like what you did at the beginning, possess her, make her focus all her attention on you." [[10451 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head and fell silent for a moment. "But will that make her fall in love with me?" [[10452 池小橙 sad]]
Dark Xiaocheng said: "If she doesn't like you at all, she will only feel fear. You know, people only learn to cherish something after they've lost it." [[10453 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"The good behavior and sweetness of this past half-month were enough to make her heart flutter for you. Otherwise, on the bridge, she wouldn't have rejected you like that, right?" [[10454 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng whispered, as if a bit of reason was returning to her eyes, "So, she was pretending to like me before, and only now she might have a little bit of affection for me." [[10455 池小橙 sad]]
"Yes." Dark Xiaocheng's voice echoed in her ear. "But just a little isn't enough." [[10456 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"She's already going to meet her fiancé. What... are you going to do?" [[10457 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng closed her eyes and sighed softly, "Hey, my other self." [[10458 池小橙 sad]]
"Hmm~?" [[10459 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at the window, her miserable reflection looking back at her. [[10460 旁白 sad]]
"You always say I'm a mask called 'a normal person'. If that's the case, then just take over my consciousness." [[10461 池小橙 sad]]
"What?" Dark Xiaocheng looked stunned. [[10462 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled bitterly, her hands trembling. "You're more ruthless than me, and more possessive. If you replace me, you'll be better at tying Taotao down, right?" [[10463 池小橙 sad]]
"I... I'm afraid I can't be cruel enough." [[10464 池小橙 sad]]
A trace of confusion appeared in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[10465 旁白 sad]]
In her despair, her heart felt like it was dying. [[10466 旁白 sad]]
Dark Xiaocheng sighed and floated up lightly on her toes. [[10467 旁白 neutral]]
She moved behind Chi Xiaocheng, wrapping her arms around her neck in a gentle hug from behind. [[10468 旁白 neutral]]
She rested her cheek on her shoulder, her voice no longer tempting, but incredibly gentle. [[10469 旁白 neutral]]
"It's normal to feel scared, anxious, and hesitant to act." [[10470 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"And you're not wrong. You just want someone to truly love you." [[10471 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"That dream separated you and me." [[10472 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"It allowed you to see yourself more clearly." [[10473 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"But it also stripped away your courage, your possessiveness, your twisted love." [[10474 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"You're asking me to erase your consciousness and take over this body." [[10475 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"How could I do that?" [[10476 漆黑小橙 sad]]
"You and I are both masks." [[10477 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"What we are protecting together is a heart that longs for love but is also extremely fragile." [[10478 漆黑小橙 sad]]
Whether it's an act, or being a yandere. [[10479 旁白 neutral]]
Just like you at the traffic light in your past life. [[10480 旁白 neutral]]
Just like you during the summer vacation when you broke down because Ye Liang stole Su Tao from you. [[10481 旁白 neutral]]
Your courage is with me. [[10482 旁白 neutral]]
"So, to avoid getting hurt again, for the person you love, to change that ridiculous ending, and to be with Taotao forever." [[10483 漆黑小橙 happy]]
"Go face and accept that twisted love." [[10484 漆黑小橙 happy]]
"I will always be by your side to give you courage." [[10485 漆黑小橙 happy]]
Dark Xiaocheng gently closed her eyes, brought her lips to Chi Xiaocheng's ear, and whispered softly. [[10486 旁白 neutral]]
"Good night." [[10487 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
The dream should end now. [[10488 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat dazedly on the sofa, a single, glistening tear rolling down her cheek. [[10489 旁白 sad]]
Her previous anxiety gradually faded, replaced by a feeling of her soul being filled. [[10490 旁白 neutral]]
Her goal had never changed from the very beginning. [[10491 旁白 neutral]]
Possess her, use her female lead aura to change her own cannon fodder fate, and change Su Tao's tragic end of suicide. [[10492 旁白 neutral]]
But what was different now from the beginning was an added layer of affection and love. [[10493 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly took out her phone, her frantic, crimson eyes holding a strange, extreme clarity. "You're right, people only learn to cherish what they've lost." [[10494 池小橙 neutral]]
"If I keep following the plot set by the world's will, following the original story, I will definitely get hurt." [[10495 池小橙 sad]]
"Therefore, Taotao, you can only be with me, and change this ending with me..." [[10496 池小橙 neutral]]
You can't go to your fiancé, you can only come to me. [[10497 池小橙 angry]]
You are mine!!! [[10498 池小橙 angry]]
She sent a message to Su Tao: "Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[10499 池小橙 neutral]]
Just like that night on the rooftop. [[10500 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng picked up a fruit knife from the table, her gaze lingering for a moment on the scapegoat doll in the system space. [[10501 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she rolled up her sleeve. [[10502 旁白 neutral]]
"This is going to hurt, isn't it?" [[10503 池小橙 sad]]
