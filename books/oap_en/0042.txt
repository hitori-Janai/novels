Chapter 42 The Reason She Likes You [[3597 旁白 neutral]]
At Linghu Park, Su Tao was walking when she suddenly froze the moment she took out her phone. [[3598 旁白 neutral]]
Beside her, Si Chen, wearing glasses, had his hands in his pockets. His sharp eyes showed a hint of curiosity as he glanced at her, "Why did you stop?" [[3599 司辰 neutral]]
"A message from one of my brothers has left me a little... at a loss." [[3600 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao held up her phone and showed it to Si Chen. [[3601 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen pushed up his glasses, "Aren't you an orphan? You have a brother? And what does he mean by that question?" [[3602 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao put down her phone and looked up at the sky. [[3603 旁白 neutral]]
"He's Xiaocheng's brother. For a while when I was little, I lived at Xiaocheng's house, and Brother Chi Song took good care of me. Although our relationship was formed because of Xiaocheng, he watched me grow up, so he's like a half-brother to me." [[3604 苏桃 neutral]]
"And then I don't understand why Brother Chi Song would ask such a question!" [[3605 苏桃 neutral]]
She ruffled her hair, feeling like so many things had happened recently that she was going bald. [[3606 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen said, "This must be related to Chi Xiaocheng, asking if you like his sister... wait a minute!" [[3607 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen found the blind spot and looked at Su Tao in shock, "You told me before that Chi Xiaocheng is a yandere, and about all the excessive things she did to you. I never understood her motive." [[3608 司辰 neutral]]
"And you wouldn't tell me, always finding it hard to speak." [[3609 司辰 neutral]]
"Now I understand." Si Chen suddenly realized, "Chi Xiaocheng became a yandere because she likes you?" [[3610 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao scratched her cheek, turning her face away in embarrassment. [[3611 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, she turned back, spreading her hands as if seeking resonance, "You also think it's strange, right? I'm also a girl, why would she fall in love with me?" [[3612 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen's mouth twitched, "It's not unlikely that she'd fall in love with you, is it?" [[3613 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao: "???" [[3614 苏桃 surprised]]
"We're friends, aren't we? Why are you still speaking up for Xiaocheng?" [[3615 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen walked towards the pavilion helplessly, "A well-known psychology professor at Cornell University once conducted a large-scale survey on sexual orientation. Among absolute heterosexuals, the male proportion is higher than the female, but among bisexuals, the female proportion is higher than the male." [[3616 司辰 neutral]]
"Women are naturally drawn to strength. Why do many young girls in middle and high school who are in early relationships often get involved with delinquents? Because at that time, their minds are not yet mature, and they don't consider things like careers or future prospects." [[3617 司辰 neutral]]
"Being able to fight, being powerful, and acting a bit more mature than their peers is considered excellent in the eyes of some." [[3618 司辰 neutral]]
"We cannot view children with an adult mindset. Family reasons, social environment, and the breadth of exposure all influence a person's thinking." [[3619 司辰 neutral]]
"You once told me that Chi Xiaocheng was rescued by you after being bullied. At that time, she had no friends, and even the teachers didn't favor her. Your appearance became her only." [[3620 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen held up one finger, then extended a second. [[3621 旁白 neutral]]
"Secondly, as a companion who grew up together, you are the dominant party. A child's adoration, longing, outward focus, and dependence can easily lead to negative changes due to learning incorrect knowledge." [[3622 司辰 neutral]]
"For example, watching a melodramatic romance drama." [[3623 司辰 neutral]]
"What the TV says about 'forever together' is the beautiful confession between the male and female leads; after watching the drama, if you say a few things like that in reality, you'll definitely be misunderstood." [[3624 司辰 neutral]]
"And a very important point." Si Chen looked Su Tao up and down, and said helplessly, "You're too beautiful." [[3625 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao paused, "Does that count?" [[3626 苏桃 neutral]]
"Although you're easily swayed and indecisive, you're decisive in your actions, and it's normal for someone with high beauty to be popular with both sexes, isn't it?" [[3627 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao was speechless for a moment, "This..." [[3628 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen bent another finger, "Look, you became Chi Xiaocheng's object of dependence, you gave her a sense of security, and you occasionally said some ambiguous sweet nothings, holding hands and growing up together, pinky promises for a hundred years." [[3629 司辰 neutral]]
"Forget about Chi Xiaocheng being a girl, even if she were an alien, she'd have other thoughts!" [[3630 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen sighed, "Miss Su Tao, this is a society of free love. One day, Chi Xiaocheng will scroll through Douyin, play some anime, and a lot of yuri content will be pushed to her. At the age of first love, who can resist that?" [[3631 司辰 neutral]]
The more Su Tao listened to Si Chen's analysis, the more she sweated, "You... don't say anymore. You're putting too much pressure on me!" [[3632 苏桃 sad]]
Si Chen glanced at her lightly, "See, you're avoiding it again." [[3633 司辰 neutral]]
"I..." Su Tao pouted aggrievedly, "I came to you to analyze whether Xiaocheng is a yandere or not, don't change the subject!" [[3634 苏桃 sad]]
"Ah, yes, yes, yes." [[3635 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen shrugged and chose to comply. [[3636 旁白 neutral]]
He sat on the chair with one hand propping his chin, "So, why do you think she's not a yandere anymore?" [[3637 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao sat opposite him, her expression serious. [[3638 旁白 neutral]]
She summarized and repeated what Liu Guijia had said earlier. [[3639 旁白 neutral]]
And added her own analysis, "Normally, yanderes don't know they're yanderes, but Xiaocheng said something like that. This has already formed a paradox!" [[3640 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen propped his chin with one hand and said speechlessly, "The fact that you can ask such a question means you want me to answer that she's not actually a yandere, right?" [[3641 司辰 neutral]]
"I didn't..." [[3642 苏桃 neutral]]
"Stop!" Si Chen reached out and interrupted Su Tao, "I've studied psychology, and although I've only scratched the surface, I can tell that you just can't believe Chi Xiaocheng is a yandere, so you're stubbornly trying to prove otherwise." [[3643 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao was anxious, "But it's really a paradox!" [[3644 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Then do you want me to tell you that Chi Xiaocheng kidnapping you, confessing madly to you, self-harming, and threatening to jump off a building, it's all an act, just to play with you?" [[3645 司辰 neutral]]
"From the moment Chi Xiaocheng confessed to me out of jealousy for you, I felt that she was very twisted." [[3646 司辰 neutral]]
He and Su Tao were just ordinary opposite-sex friends, and still are. He didn't understand why Chi Xiaocheng was jealous at that time. [[3647 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen still remembered. At the beginning of the semester, he ran into Su Tao and helped her move some luggage, and then Chi Xiaocheng became hostile towards him. [[3648 旁白 neutral]]
Hostility was fine, but then she inexplicably came to confess, which really confused Si Chen. [[3649 旁白 neutral]]
Although it only happened once. [[3650 旁白 neutral]]
But since she was hostile to me, why did she choose to "retaliate" by confessing? [[3651 旁白 neutral]]
She was dressed like a ghost, and Si Chen didn't like it. One look scared him away. [[3652 旁白 neutral]]
After discussing this, Su Tao, under Si Chen's layer-by-layer analysis, finally hung her head like a defeated dog, "Okay, I still can't quite believe that Xiaocheng is a yandere and that she likes me." [[3653 苏桃 sad]]
Si Chen looked at Su Tao's dejected appearance and sighed inwardly, "If you really want to confirm it, there are currently two methods you can try." [[3654 司辰 neutral]]
"What methods?" [[3655 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao's eyes lit up. [[3656 旁白 neutral]]
She still had a tiny bit of hope that Chi Xiaocheng wasn't a yandere. [[3657 旁白 neutral]]
She hoped it was all an act. [[3658 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen said lightly, "The first method: in a couple of days, aren't you going to be Ye Liang's maid? Tell Chi Xiaocheng that you're going to part ways with her, and then see her reaction. Do you dare to try it?" [[3659 司辰 neutral]]
