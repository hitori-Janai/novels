Chapter 220: A Bad Feeling [[19084 旁白 neutral]]
In Dongfang Yang's view, this was the most likely possibility! [[19085 旁白 neutral]]
Her becoming cold, even rejecting her, could be explained if you considered it a self-protective response by the brain to something painful. [[19086 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, especially, knew exactly why it had come to this. [[19087 旁白 neutral]]
The bullet before death was incredibly painful. Even if Chi Xiaocheng had said she was satisfied, if she put herself in that position, she would of course be unwilling to die like that. [[19088 旁白 sad]]
She hadn't received a confession from the person she liked, and they hadn't truly gotten together. To die like that would naturally feel painful and unfair. [[19089 旁白 sad]]
Plus, before she was shot, aside from that final moment of relief, she had argued with Chi Xiaocheng! [[19090 旁白 sad]]
She said things like she didn't like her, hated her, and was afraid of her yandere side. [[19091 旁白 sad]]
There were many arguments in the "little black room" back then. [[19092 旁白 sad]]
Even before that, she had said she didn't want Chi Xiaocheng interfering in her life. [[19093 旁白 sad]]
Because of her yandere nature, she had made so many mistakes. Looking back, wasn't her first suicide attempt also her fault? [[19094 旁白 sad]]
With all that as a pretext, if she had sealed away that part of her memory, wouldn't that explain it? [[19095 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, this was just one possibility. [[19096 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's heart grew heavier, but she kept listening to Dongfang Yang's analysis, sentence by sentence. [[19097 旁白 sad]]
He said, "I haven't seen Chi Xiaocheng yet, so I don't know what her memory or impression of me is like. But just from what Su Tao has said, if she has sealed her memories and emotions, I think it might be from the time around when you two argued because of Ye Liang." [[19098 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao froze for a moment. "Ye Liang?" [[19099 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yes." Dongfang Yang nodded. "Although I don't want to bring that guy up, looking at your history, the only time Chi Xiaocheng could possibly have hated you was during that period, right? Didn't you say your relationship was very good before graduating high school?" [[19100 东方阳 neutral]]
"Mhm!" Su Tao nodded forcefully. "Before graduating high school, Xiaocheng and I were... we were like sisters. After we argued, and because of all the misunderstandings with Ye Liang, I distanced myself from her for a few months. Our relationship was at its worst during that time." [[19101 苏桃 sad]]
"But after that, we slowly made up, and our relationship got better and better." [[19102 苏桃 neutral]]
She wasn't telling the whole truth, but it wasn't misleading. [[19103 旁白 neutral]]
She was avoiding and rejecting Xiaocheng, but Xiaocheng's feelings and love for her were growing deeper. So, telling Dongfang Yang and Professor Su that it was "getting better and better" wasn't wrong. [[19104 旁白 neutral]]
The Xiaocheng from back then would never have hated her like she did now. [[19105 旁白 sad]]
Whether it was a romantic "like" or a familial "like," at any other time, if she had said those things, Xiaocheng wouldn't have clearly said "I don't like you." [[19106 旁白 sad]]
Dongfang Yang continued along Su Tao's line of thought, "If her memory is sealed before that point, it's understandable why she would be cold to you. After all, in her eyes, you were still close with Ye Liang, and you were ignoring and neglecting her because of it." [[19107 东方阳 neutral]]
After hearing Dongfang Yang's words, Su Tao felt a pang in her heart, but she also slowly breathed a sigh of relief. [[19108 旁白 neutral]]
If that's really the case, that would be for the best. [[19109 旁白 happy]]
After all, deep down, Xiaocheng still likes me, right? [[19110 旁白 happy]]
She just isn't showing it, she's hiding that part of herself. Otherwise, she wouldn't have confessed to me in the basement, and the "little black room" incident wouldn't have happened later. [[19111 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao looked up slightly, staring blankly at the clock on the wall. [[19112 旁白 neutral]]
The basement... [[19113 旁白 neutral]]
After all this time, are we back where we started? [[19114 旁白 sad]]
Does that mean she'll have to go through Xiaocheng's yandere phase all over again? [[19115 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao suddenly clenched her fists. [[19116 旁白 angry]]
If that's the case, she absolutely won't make the wrong choice again! [[19117 旁白 angry]]
At that moment, Dongfang Yang changed the subject. "However, this is just my guess. If her memory has reverted to that time, my relationship with Chi Xiaocheng was also pretty average." [[19118 东方阳 neutral]]
Back then, Chi Xiaocheng's makeup looked like a mess. Without the cute face bonus, and with a negative first impression, Dongfang Yang had also been quite annoyed by this little one. [[19119 旁白 neutral]]
He recalled the past with some emotion. [[19120 旁白 neutral]]
So he said to Su Tao and Professor Su, "I'll go talk to Chi Xiaocheng first and see if she still remembers me." [[19121 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao immediately stood up. "I'll go with you." [[19122 苏桃 neutral]]
"Um... Su Tao, you should probably stay here for now. Chi Xiaocheng has a bad impression of you, and you two just had a bit of an emotional moment. It might be counterproductive." [[19123 东方阳 neutral]]
Professor Su also nodded. "Miss Su, you should wait for now. Miss Chi's condition shouldn't be subjected to too much emotion. We are still in the guessing stage. I need to contact a psychologist first, and I also need to use equipment to test and confirm what exactly is wrong with Miss Chi." [[19124 苏教授 neutral]]
Even though Su Tao was very anxious, she could only suppress her feelings. [[19125 旁白 sad]]
Then she kept comforting herself: Look on the bright side, Xiaocheng has already woken up, right? Compared to the outcome of her dying or being in a coma forever, this is already fantastic news. The final result will surely be good. [[19126 旁白 happy]]
She picked up her phone and immediately sent a message to Doctor Cheng. [[19127 旁白 neutral]]
... [[19128 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Dongfang Yang was on his way to Chi Xiaocheng's room. [[19129 旁白 neutral]]
He was thinking about how he should talk to Chi Xiaocheng if her memory really was cut off around the time of the Ye Liang incident. [[19130 旁白 neutral]]
"Back then, did she dislike me?" [[19131 东方阳 neutral]]
"After all, she did confess to me." [[19132 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang arrived on the 8th floor and sighed, "But compared to now, the old Chi Xiaocheng probably didn't like me that much, right? The fact that she liked me so much later must be because she was conquered by my brilliant charm." [[19133 东方阳 happy]]
Lost in his own thoughts, Dongfang Yang arrived outside the hospital room. [[19134 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the girl sitting乖巧ly on the bed, staring blankly at the scenery outside, a smile involuntarily touched his lips. [[19135 旁白 happy]]
From her lying quietly in the hospital bed to being alive now, Dongfang Yang had seen it all. Even knowing that Chi Xiaocheng might have memory and emotional problems, he couldn't help but feel happy for her. [[19136 旁白 happy]]
So he knocked on the doorframe and walked right in. [[19137 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng turn around, he greeted her first, "Yo, Chi Xiaocheng, still remember me?" [[19138 东方阳 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng gave a slight smile. "Boss, what are you joking about? Of course I remember you." [[19139 池小橙 happy]]
Dongfang Yang was taken aback by her title. "Boss?" [[19140 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head. "Is there a problem? Didn't you tell me to call you Boss before?" [[19141 池小橙 neutral]]
"Wait a minute..." [[19142 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang pressed his forehead and rubbed his brow. [[19143 旁白 neutral]]
According to Su Tao, her memory should have been cut off not long after school started, when Su Tao and Ye Liang were still on good terms. [[19144 旁白 neutral]]
Calling me Boss... could the cutoff be around the time she was working at the cafe? [[19145 旁白 neutral]]
But by that time, her relationship with Su Tao had already eased up quite a bit, right? [[19146 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang wasn't sure, so he said to Chi Xiaocheng, "There's no problem with calling me Boss, but you skip work every day and only clock in when you feel like it. You still recognize me as your boss?" [[19147 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng embarrassedly twirled a lock of hair by her cheek with her index finger. "Well, the cafe didn't have much business anyway. Big Brother Chu San said they didn't need me." [[19148 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow. Hearing Chi Xiaocheng's explanation, it seemed she had been working at the cafe for a long time. [[19149 旁白 neutral]]
If it was that much later, hadn't her relationship with Su Tao already been repaired? [[19150 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang thought for a moment and asked, "Chi Xiaocheng, how do you feel about... Ye Liang?" [[19151 东方阳 neutral]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng frowned and said to Dongfang Yang with considerable disgust, "Ye Liang is already dead, why bring him up?" [[19152 池小橙 angry]]
As soon as she said this, Dongfang Yang's pupils contracted. [[19153 旁白 sad]]
He had a very bad feeling about Chi Xiaocheng's situation. [[19154 旁白 sad]]
