Chapter 112 Do You Really Like Her? [[9752 旁白 neutral]]
Over the next two days, Chi Xiaocheng could clearly feel that Su Tao was spending less time here. [[9753 旁白 sad]]
Before, even if Su Tao didn't sleep over, she would stay until the dormitory was about to close. Chi Xiaocheng had the whole evening to be with her. [[9754 旁白 sad]]
She didn't need to do anything exciting; just sitting quietly, holding hands, or sharing a hug was enough. [[9755 旁白 sad]]
However, even that was slowly becoming a luxury. [[9756 旁白 sad]]
On December 22nd, Su Tao only came for two hours in the evening. [[9757 旁白 sad]]
On December 23rd, Su Tao only came for a meal. They barely chatted before she received a call and left in a hurry. [[9758 旁白 sad]]
On December 24th, Su Tao didn't come at all. [[9759 旁白 sad]]
Staring at her phone, Chi Xiaocheng bit her lower lip, feeling down. [[9760 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao: "Sorry, Xiaocheng, I'm really caught up with something today. Just rest at home. I got my driver's license, so I'll drive over to pick you up tomorrow." [[9761 苏桃 neutral]]
"We can go shopping together." [[9762 苏桃 happy]]
The words on the screen had no warmth, but to Chi Xiaocheng, they felt incredibly cold. [[9763 旁白 sad]]
What is Tao Tao so busy with? [[9764 池小橙 sad]]
Why does she have so much to do every day? [[9765 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't understand. After deciding to be a good girl, she didn't dare to ask too many questions. [[9766 旁白 neutral]]
She loved the smile on Su Tao's face when she patted her head and praised her for being "so good." [[9767 旁白 happy]]
Even without Dark Xiaocheng whispering in her ear, influenced by past events, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but recall her words. [[9768 旁白 sad]]
"Acting obedient will never win you Su Tao." [[9769 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
She has friends, mentors, colleagues, and all sorts of things to fill her life. [[9770 旁白 neutral]]
She is very, very busy, so she can't pay attention to me. [[9771 旁白 sad]]
"Well, have you finally figured out what I was talking about?" [[9772 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
With a swing of her skirt, Dark Xiaocheng leaned against the armrest of the sofa, arms crossed, standing elegantly. [[9773 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at Dark Xiaocheng and mumbled, "She's just busy today. Tao Tao has to take her driving test, so it's... it's normal for her to be busy." [[9774 池小橙 sad]]
"I can understand..." [[9775 池小橙 sad]]
"Yes, I can understand!" [[9776 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng added, as if to calm her own uneasy heart. [[9777 旁白 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng sighed, "You're so stubborn. It's so obvious, yet you keep lying to yourself. Are you afraid to accept the fact that Su Tao doesn't actually care about you that much?" [[9778 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes turned red, and the vertical pupils that hadn't appeared for half a month suddenly glowed with a crimson light. "Who said she doesn't care about me? She always tells me I'm great. She must be preparing a surprise for me tomorrow!" [[9779 池小橙 angry]]
Dark Xiaocheng snorted softly, "Oh, please. Look at you. If you're not deceiving yourself, what are you doing? What kind of surprise could it be? Holding hands? Shopping? Or her faking a 'I like you'?" [[9780 漆黑小橙 angry]]
Dark Xiaocheng walked step by step toward Chi Xiaocheng in her high heels. "She's told you she likes you so many times, right? How about we test her?" [[9781 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"Test her?" [[9782 池小橙 neutral]]
"That's right." [[9783 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng snapped her fingers. "Since she likes you so much and has prepared a surprise, why don't you confess to her when you get the surprise tomorrow and ask her to be your girlfriend? How about it?" [[9784 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had also said she liked Su Tao many times. [[9785 旁白 neutral]]
Whether forced or for other reasons, Su Tao would say the same words in response. [[9786 旁白 neutral]]
Putting other factors aside, they had both said "I like you" more than ten times. [[9787 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, neither of them had ever taken the first step to define their relationship as a couple. [[9788 旁白 neutral]]
And make it official. [[9789 旁白 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng wasn't in a hurry. She extended a finger covered by a black mesh glove and poked Chi Xiaocheng's heart. "And you, you say you like her, but you act obediently to beg for her pity, rejecting your own desire to possess her. Is that really what you call 'like'?" [[9790 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"Do your feelings for Su Tao really make your heart race?" [[9791 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"It's completely different from how you felt about your ex-girlfriend, isn't it? You definitely liked your ex-girlfriend more than you like Su Tao, right?" [[9792 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"Since you don't like Su Tao but want her love, why run away from it? Just possess her." [[9793 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"Her world will only have you, and your world will only have her. Feelings will grow over time, and you will naturally become each other's one and only." [[9794 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng's words were logical and well-reasoned. [[9795 旁白 neutral]]
They struck a chord deep in Chi Xiaocheng's heart. [[9796 旁白 neutral]]
Everything I've been doing... are my feelings for Tao Tao really 'like'? [[9797 池小橙 sad]]
I just long for someone to love me like that, but my feelings for Tao Tao now are different from how I felt about Yiran, my ex-girlfriend, in my past life. [[9798 池小橙 sad]]
"No!" [[9799 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng suddenly realized, staring straight at Dark Xiaocheng. [[9800 旁白 neutral]]
Dark Xiaocheng just gave a faint, calm smile. [[9801 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng gritted her teeth, "You're misleading me. I would never treat Tao Tao as a replacement for Yiran. In the end, Yiran can't even compare to Tao Tao!" [[9802 池小橙 angry]]
The memories of those two years had long since turned to foam. [[9803 旁白 neutral]]
For the past month, the image in Chi Xiaocheng's heart had been completely replaced by Su Tao. [[9804 旁白 neutral]]
"No heart-racing moments?" [[9805 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"No 'like'?" [[9806 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"You're just my inner demon. How would you know that I don't like Tao Tao!" [[9807 池小橙 angry]]
"She gently strokes my hair; [[9808 池小橙 happy]]
kindly tells me she likes me; [[9809 池小橙 happy]]
holds an umbrella for me so the snow doesn't fall on me; [[9810 池小橙 happy]]
holds my hand tightly when we're walking; [[9811 池小橙 happy]]
asks for more when we kiss; [[9812 池小橙 happy]]
and even though she's so busy, she worries I can't cook and comes over every day to make me dinner, afraid I'll be malnourished from eating too much takeout!" [[9813 池小橙 happy]]
"No one can compare to her!" [[9814 池小橙 happy]]
"Why wouldn't I like a girl like that!" [[9815 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng glared at her fiercely. "Just you wait. The surprise Tao Tao has for me tomorrow will leave you speechless!" [[9816 池小橙 angry]]
The last sentence was almost a roar. [[9817 旁白 angry]]
She panted heavily, but when she came to her senses, the elegant figure in the black dress was nowhere to be seen. [[9818 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if the inner demon that sometimes tempted her didn't exist at all. [[9819 旁白 neutral]]
On the sofa, only the usually proud cat remained, curled up with its tail wrapped around itself, sleeping. [[9820 旁白 neutral]]
The empty room seemed to have become incredibly deep and cold. [[9821 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened her dry lips, but no words came out. [[9822 旁白 sad]]
Finally, she walked silently to the sofa, drew her knees together, wrapped her arms around them, and rested her head on her knees, quietly waiting for time to pass. [[9823 旁白 sad]]
"Tao Tao... I miss you." [[9824 池小橙 sad]]
For half a month, she had been playing the part of the obedient Xiaocheng, not once using her yandere side to threaten the girl. [[9825 旁白 neutral]]
And the girl, indeed, did as she wished. [[9826 旁白 neutral]]
Patting her head, praising her, and whispering sweet nothings. [[9827 旁白 neutral]]
Like family, they ate together every day, depending on each other. [[9828 旁白 neutral]]
But why? [[9829 池小橙 sad]]
Why do I still feel so lonely? [[9830 池小橙 sad]]
Threads of unease crept into Chi Xiaocheng's body with the cold air. [[9831 旁白 sad]]
In agony, the second hand pushed the minute hand forward, and with great difficulty, urged the hour hand to move faster. [[9832 旁白 sad]]
Finally, the time came to December 25th. [[9833 旁白 neutral]]
The day Chi Xiaocheng had been eagerly awaiting. [[9834 旁白 happy]]
Early in the morning, Chi Xiaocheng changed her clothes and sat obediently on the sofa, waiting. [[9835 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of the lock on the door turning finally came at nine o'clock. [[9836 旁白 happy]]
As the door opened, a pleasant voice said, "Good morning, Xiaocheng. I'm here to pick you up." [[9837 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng immediately jumped off the sofa, her eyes lighting up. "Tao Tao, you're finally here! Are we going on a date today?" [[9838 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao paused for a moment, then smiled faintly. "Yes, we're going shopping together today!" [[9839 苏桃 happy]]
PS: I used AI to draw Xiaocheng, I personally like it. I can commission a high-quality one after I get paid next month. [[9840 旁白 neutral]]
