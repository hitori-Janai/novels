Chapter 243: Loyal to Cheng! [[20786 旁白 neutral]]
Now that the cards are on the table, some things had to be brought up. [[20787 旁白 neutral]]
The last time she met Si Chen, she had wanted to settle old scores. But with her ultimate acting skills and emotional numbness, she had forced herself to hold back for the sake of the plan. [[20788 旁白 neutral]]
But now... [[20789 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng raised an eyebrow at Si Chen. "Are you trying to steal Taotao from me?" [[20790 池小橙 angry]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng about to reveal her yandere side, Si Chen wasn't scared at all; in fact, he felt a little excited. [[20791 旁白 neutral]]
She was back, all of her was back! [[20792 司辰 happy]]
A crazy Chi Xiaocheng was much better than an amnesiac one. This way, he could control Su Tao better, and once her father returned, he could proceed with his plan. [[20793 旁白 neutral]]
Without showing any fear, Si Chen met Chi Xiaocheng's gaze and let out a cold laugh. [[20794 旁白 neutral]]
Under Chi Xiaocheng's confused and surprised gaze, he suddenly extended his right hand, and with a flick, he coolly and deftly pinched his collar with two fingers. [[20795 旁白 neutral]]
With a "swoosh," before Chi Xiaocheng could even react, Si Chen shook his hand, and his overcoat was off. His right hand unbuttoned his inner shirt so quickly it was dazzling. [[20796 旁白 neutral]]
His movements were elegant and skilled. As he took off his shirt, he even gave it a light flick, creating a whip-like crack in the air. His strong and imposing body was left in just a T-shirt. [[20797 旁白 neutral]]
"You... what are you trying to do?" [[20798 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng had already used her Emotion Points to secretly buy a fruit knife from the System's shop. [[20799 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen didn't answer. Instead, he calmly turned around, glanced back at Chi Xiaocheng with a wicked smile, grabbed the hem of his T-shirt with both hands, and yanked it up. [[20800 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, a tattoo on his back was revealed—Never Love Tao! [[20801 旁白 neutral]]
A golden light! It was so blinding it was hard to see what was in front of them! [[20802 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmph! I finally got a chance to show this off." [[20803 司辰 happy]]
With a light snort, Si Chen looked out the window into the dark night, his face filled with a world-weary and storied expression. [[20804 旁白 neutral]]
He calmly turned back, without a hint of panic. "Now, do you still think I'm trying to steal your Su Tao?" [[20805 司辰 neutral]]
Loyalty? [[20806 旁白 neutral]]
Loyal to Cheng! [[20807 旁白 neutral]]
With this "get-out-of-jail-free card" played, even Chi Xiaocheng, who was on the verge of going full yandere, was shocked into silence. [[20808 旁白 neutral]]
She had heard that Si Chen had done something to earn her trust, but seeing it for the first time was still hard to believe. [[20809 旁白 neutral]]
Her expression grew strange. "Your body is a gift from your parents. Don't big families like yours care about that? I heard even a scar on the face can be a big deal." [[20810 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen calmly put his clothes back on. "It's all for the plan. A small sacrifice like this is nothing." [[20811 司辰 neutral]]
"Alright..." Chi Xiaocheng's rationality returned. She now understood why Si Chen had said what he did in the hospital room. He was trying to provoke her to confirm if she was truly herself again. [[20812 池小橙 neutral]]
"But you'd better not say things like that again. I'm afraid I really won't be able to stop myself from hurting you." [[20813 池小橙 angry]]
You're not allowed to like my Taotao. [[20814 池小橙 angry]]
Not even as a joke! [[20815 池小橙 angry]]
Si Chen cleared his throat softly and nodded. "Let's get back to the main topic. I came to see you this time mainly about Su Tao." [[20816 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat on the bed and blinked. "What's wrong with Taotao now?" [[20817 池小橙 neutral]]
"It's more about her father," Si Chen said. "Do you remember the marriage certificate and the jade pendant from Xiao Ming?" [[20818 司辰 neutral]]
"I remember." [[20819 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang had torn up the marriage certificate, and the jade pendant did match the other half that Su Tao had worn for years. [[20820 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen said, "The marriage certificate was a fake. I've already confirmed this. Ye Liang was behind it, trying to trick Su Tao with it. But the jade pendant, the token, is real." [[20821 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was stunned for a moment. "So, that means Taotao's father doesn't actually know she's still in the country?" [[20822 池小橙 neutral]]
"That's right." [[20823 司辰 neutral]]
Did I misunderstand Taotao last time when she tried to kill herself? [[20824 旁白 neutral]]
Even now, I haven't finished the original novel's 4 million words. [[20825 旁白 neutral]]
Five Emotion Points per chapter is too expensive now that my income is getting smaller. [[20826 旁白 neutral]]
A high-quality tool like Chu Lingfeng isn't always around to be exploited. [[20827 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could only check the plot details by looking at the chapter and volume titles. [[20828 旁白 neutral]]
And every time she looked at the chapter titles, the clickbait-y names would make her blood boil. [[20829 旁白 neutral]]
She would think that her Taotao was going to be taken advantage of by one of the male leads. [[20830 旁白 neutral]]
But then she would click on it. [[20831 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter Title: [Chapter 276, Please, I'm Begging You, This Isn't Right] [[20832 旁白 neutral]]
What Chi Xiaocheng thought: Her Taotao was about to be harassed by a male lead. [[20833 旁白 neutral]]
Fuming meow! [[20834 旁白 neutral]]
Actual chapter content: A male lead showing off and putting someone in their place, while the defeated lackeys kneeled and begged for mercy. [[20835 旁白 neutral]]
With 4 million words, there were so many chapters. The second half, where a rich female character suddenly appeared and the whole book turned into a tragedy for Tao, was one thing. But the first half was full of clickbait chapters like this. [[20836 旁白 neutral]]
Every time Chi Xiaocheng saw one, she couldn't resist spending 5 Emotion Points to see what was really going on. [[20837 旁白 neutral]]
And the result was, it seemed her Taotao still had her first kiss by the end of the story. [[20838 旁白 neutral]]
From a few single-chapter author's notes, it seemed the book's outrageous plot twists had been reported by countless readers. [[20839 旁白 neutral]]
To avoid giving readers anything to complain about, the author made the entire book very tame, despite the drama. [[20840 旁白 neutral]]
Kissing? [[20841 旁白 neutral]]
Nope. [[20842 旁白 neutral]]
Hugging? [[20843 旁白 neutral]]
That's crossing the line. [[20844 旁白 neutral]]
Intimate scenes? [[20845 旁白 neutral]]
Can you even write that in a novel? [[20846 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed the original author also had some serious quirks. Even though Su Tao interacted a lot with the other male leads in the early stages, as the sole female lead, she never had any very romantic scenes. [[20847 旁白 neutral]]
In any other female-targeted novel, the female lead would have already ended up with all the male leads. [[20848 旁白 neutral]]
The original novel Su Tao was in was an exception. She remained pure until the very end. [[20849 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't have enough Emotion Points to read that much of the original novel, so she naturally didn't know how the God of War father found Su Tao. [[20850 旁白 neutral]]
Now she could only ask Si Chen, "The marriage certificate is fake, but what about the jade pendant?" [[20851 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen took the half-pendant from his pocket and handed it to Chi Xiaocheng. "I had someone steal this from Xiao Ming before he disappeared." [[20852 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng touched the jade pendant. "This is definitely real." [[20853 池小橙 neutral]]
It felt just as real as she remembered from the original Xiaocheng's memories. [[20854 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen then continued, "I also had people investigate this jade pendant, focusing on foreign countries. It's been over a month, but we finally have some news about her father." [[20855 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng quickly asked, "What news?" [[20856 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "There's a man with the surname Su in a foreign country. He's a Da Zhou native with a hidden identity, known as the God of War. He's active in various mercenary battlefields, and his forces are feared even by some small countries." [[20857 司辰 neutral]]
"But now, he hasn't returned to the country because he's tied up with another organization. It's very difficult to conduct a deep investigation right now. The last thing we found was the name of that organization." [[20858 司辰 neutral]]
"Asura Hall!" Si Chen said gravely, drawing out the three words. Then he changed the subject. "This Xiao Ming has always called himself the Dragon King. I suspect he's a member of Asura Hall." [[20859 司辰 neutral]]
Hearing his news, Chi Xiaocheng was a bit stunned. [[20860 旁白 neutral]]
The one stopping the God of War father's return was Xiao Ming, the guy who had been patiently waiting for three years in the original novel only to disappear? [[20861 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen said to Chi Xiaocheng, "I believe the key breakthrough now lies with Xiao Ming. As for his so-called Dragon King identity, I suspect it's fake." [[20862 司辰 neutral]]
