Chapter 81 Miss Peach, You Are Also a Yandere [[7081 旁白 neutral]]
"M-mental hospital?" [[7082 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao looked at the message from Doctor Cheng, and in an instant, many news articles she had seen online flashed through her mind. [[7083 旁白 neutral]]
Sending children to internet addiction schools, where students desperately exposed that such schools were actually violent addiction treatments, and even caused many deaths. [[7084 旁白 neutral]]
Sending people to mental hospitals, where they would be despised, neglected, and abused by various people inside. [[7085 旁白 neutral]]
No illness would be treated, but new ones would be created, and existing ones would be treated until death. [[7086 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she was hallucinating. Chi Xiaocheng was sent to a mental hospital by her, and when she came out, she was already demented. [[7087 旁白 neutral]]
Or on the verge of death. [[7088 旁白 neutral]]
She typed quickly, her hands trembling. [[7089 旁白 neutral]]
Peach: "Doctor Orange, this isn't right. Why send her to a mental hospital? You didn't say that before." [[7090 苏桃 sad]]
Peach: "Sorry, Doctor Cheng, I'm too excited. I made a typo." [[7091 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng: "I don't blame you." [[7092 成医生 neutral]]
"Before, I was optimistic because you yourself were optimistic. Your optimism would be conveyed to the patient, and only then would there be a chance for treatment." [[7093 成医生 neutral]]
"But your current state tells me that you're already at your limit and can't hold on any longer. In this state, being by Orange's friend's side will only have negative effects." [[7094 成医生 neutral]]
"Moreover, I'm also thinking of you. Your subconscious is already preventing you from contacting Orange. This is an instinctive protection. If you continue, not to mention whether Orange can be cured, you yourself will go crazy." [[7095 成医生 neutral]]
"That's why I recommend you send Orange to a mental hospital. Although the chance of treatment is slim, it's better for both you and her." [[7096 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao replied instantly, "No, Xiaocheng absolutely cannot be sent to a mental hospital!" [[7097 苏桃 angry]]
Doctor Cheng: "See, you're afraid to face her, and you're anxious when I tell you to send her to a mental hospital." [[7098 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "What exactly do you want?" [[7099 成医生 neutral]]
Looking at her phone, Su Tao's lips trembled, "What I want... what is it?" [[7100 苏桃 sad]]
Scene after scene flashed through her mind. [[7101 旁白 neutral]]
But she couldn't fix on any of them. [[7102 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Doctor Cheng sent another message, "It's too tiring to explain by typing. Is a phone call convenient?" [[7103 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly came back to her senses and called Doctor Cheng on WeChat. [[7104 旁白 neutral]]
What she heard was a mature and steady male voice, "Hello, Miss Peach, I'm Doctor Cheng." [[7105 成医生 neutral]]
Such a voice made one feel inexplicably at ease. Su Tao composed herself, "Hello, Doctor Cheng." [[7106 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng... oh no, Doctor Orange, was the first to open the conversation with a pseudovoice, "Regarding your question, I just said it. Since you have no clue, how about I ask you, and you answer?" [[7107 成医生 neutral]]
"As psychologists, we usually use a question-and-answer method to help patients sort out their situation." [[7108 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao was already extremely confused and quickly replied gratefully, "I'm fine, Doctor Cheng." [[7109 苏桃 neutral]]
"Good, first, you don't dislike your friend Orange, even if she likes you, is of the same gender, and is a yandere who does extreme things, but you still don't dislike her and don't want to abandon her, right?" [[7110 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao sat back on the sofa and nodded gently, "Yes, Doctor Cheng. Xiaocheng and I grew up together, and her family entrusted her to me. I can't abandon her." [[7111 苏桃 neutral]]
"No, no, no." Doctor Cheng said, "Don't let external factors influence your judgment. It should be based on your own feelings." [[7112 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Forget it, I'll ask more directly. Do you like her, or do you dislike her?" [[7113 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao was speechless for a moment: "I..." [[7114 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng smiled and explained, "Don't misunderstand. Liking is not just about romance. It also includes family, friends, admiration, longing, and other factors. If you really don't know if you like her, not disliking her means liking her." [[7115 成医生 neutral]]
"Not disliking... means liking..." [[7116 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao opened her mouth. She instinctively felt something was wrong, but couldn't pinpoint it. [[7117 旁白 neutral]]
She just answered according to Doctor Cheng's words, "Then I like Xiaocheng." [[7118 苏桃 neutral]]
"Very good." Doctor Cheng responded, "Then, extending from the previous two questions, either send her to a mental hospital, or try to accept her yandere tendencies, try to enjoy it." [[7119 成医生 neutral]]
"But Doctor Cheng, is there no other way?" [[7120 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng: "I'm giving you a multiple-choice question, not a fill-in-the-blank." [[7121 成医生 neutral]]
Another choice. [[7122 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips, "If I have to choose, I'll... I'll try to accept her, pretend to like her, and then... then see if I can cure her." [[7123 苏桃 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng: "Treatment is a later matter. What you're choosing now is to accept her." [[7124 成医生 neutral]]
"But Doctor Cheng." Su Tao said anxiously, "That's easy to say, but when I think of her, I'm still scared to face her." [[7125 苏桃 sad]]
"Don't worry, we're here to solve this problem." [[7126 成医生 neutral]]
"Inferring the process and origin from the result." Doctor Cheng said word by word, "The current result is that Orange has become a yandere and likes you!" [[7127 成医生 neutral]]
"So, Miss Peach, here's our question: How did she become a yandere, and why did she like you after becoming a yandere?" [[7128 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng didn't give Su Tao a chance to think and answered his own question, "The formation of a yandere is deformed and twisted. Such feelings don't appear out of thin air. There must be influences from family factors, environmental factors, and even human factors." [[7129 成医生 neutral]]
"Next, we'll analyze it bit by bit." [[7130 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng asked, "Only you know about your friend Orange. Recalling from childhood, what do you think are the family factors that influenced Orange's growth?" [[7131 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao was lost in thought, "Family... Xiaocheng comes from a poor farming family. Her parents only knew how to raise children, not educate them. Life was quite difficult." [[7132 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng added appropriately, "Such children lack proper guidance. They often learn what they see and gravitate towards it. Children who can't distinguish right from wrong are the beginning of deformity." [[7133 成医生 neutral]]
"Then what about the environmental factors that influenced her growth?" [[7134 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao's breathing became a little rapid, "Because she was small and from a poor background, and not good at communicating, before she met me at school, she was constantly bullied and picked on. Her classmates looked down on her, the teachers didn't care, and the school did nothing..." [[7135 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng: "See, suppression, extremism, and lack of proper education. The second step of deformity is thus sown. It's already very difficult for such a child to grow up normally." [[7136 成医生 neutral]]
In the hospital, Chi Xiaocheng, with a hint of unbearable sadness, yet filled with excitement and anticipation, continued to ask softly. [[7137 旁白 neutral]]
"Then, most importantly, what are the human factors from you, the object of her yandere tendencies?" [[7138 成医生 neutral]]
At this moment, Su Tao thought of something extremely terrifying, something she didn't even want to face. [[7139 旁白 neutral]]
Her legs trembled, and her lips were bloodless. [[7140 旁白 neutral]]
"The human factor is... when she was at her most desperate, helpless, and confused, I appeared by her side, pulled her up, and then..." [[7141 苏桃 sad]]
Doctor Cheng continued her words, "Then, to soothe her anxiety and encourage her, you kept telling her that she was the most important person to you, that you liked her the most, and that you would be together forever." [[7142 成医生 neutral]]
"Miss Peach, from an adult's perspective, Miss Orange's family background is poor, she didn't receive a good education, she was alone, and no one had ever stood by her side for many years." [[7143 成医生 neutral]]
"And at this time, you came. You subtly guided her thoughts, guided her emotions, made her value you, made her like you, made her believe that you would be with her forever, thus making her hopelessly dependent on you." [[7144 成医生 neutral]]
"These are all things you told me before. The naive Miss Orange was like a blank slate, absorbing and filling in all the knowledge she was told, heard, and taught." [[7145 成医生 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng's voice was deep, "From a results-oriented perspective, Miss Peach... you are also a yandere!" [[7146 成医生 neutral]]
