Chapter 162: What will be the price of lies? [[14200 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Su Tao, where is Sister Xiaocheng?" [[14201 方柠 neutral]]
The clueless, innocent, and sweet voice made Su Tao's beating heart stop for a moment. [[14202 旁白 sad]]
Ever since Chi Xiaocheng left, what she feared most was facing Chi Xiaocheng's friends and family. [[14203 旁白 sad]]
She hesitated for a whole day, not even daring to tell Chi Song about it. [[14204 旁白 sad]]
Because she didn't know how to answer. [[14205 旁白 sad]]
Where did Xiaocheng go? [[14206 旁白 sad]]
When will she come back? [[14207 旁白 sad]]
Should she say that Xiaocheng went to another world and would never return? [[14208 旁白 sad]]
That kind of expectation was like a heavy hammer striking Su Tao's heart. [[14209 旁白 sad]]
It reminded her that Chi Xiaocheng had died because of her, while also adding a burden and pressure. [[14210 旁白 sad]]
It was like being strangled, making it hard to breathe. [[14211 旁白 sad]]
While she was dazed, Fang Ning asked in a confused voice, "What's wrong, Sister Su Tao?" [[14212 方柠 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly came to her senses and hurriedly changed the subject, "By the way, how did you meet Xiaocheng? I don't think I've ever heard her mention you." [[14213 苏桃 neutral]]
She opened the door with her fingerprint, stepped aside, and got a pair of slippers for Fang Ning. "Come in." [[14214 苏桃 neutral]]
Entering the familiar house for the second time, Fang Ning felt a wave of warmth. She replied, "I met Sister Xiaocheng a month ago. I almost froze to death in the snow back then, and she was the one who saved me." [[14215 方柠 neutral]]
"She saved you?" [[14216 苏桃 neutral]]
As Su Tao was surprised, her pupils contracted slightly. [[14217 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes." Fang Ning guessed that Su Tao had recognized her and said with some embarrassment, "I used to follow Liu Guijia, but she abandoned me, so I was thrown out. The snow was very heavy at that time." [[14218 方柠 sad]]
"I had nowhere to go and almost froze to death. Then, Sister Xiaocheng passed by and saved me. She comforted me and said she would help me, and later she contacted Brother Dongfang." [[14219 方柠 neutral]]
"Brother Dongfang saw that I wasn't in school, so he got me a job as a dormitory gatekeeper." [[14220 方柠 neutral]]
Fang Ning walked into the house with a bright smile, "The school just paid me for half a month, so I wanted to buy a small gift to thank Sister Xiaocheng." [[14221 方柠 happy]]
"Without her, I probably would have died long ago." [[14222 方柠 happy]]
It was like she was recalling something tragic, but when she said it, it sounded incredibly happy. [[14223 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she wouldn't have met Chi Xiaocheng if she hadn't almost died at that time. [[14224 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled with such innocence, but in Su Tao's eyes, that smile was heart-wrenching. [[14225 旁白 sad]]
So much so that she froze in place while pouring water. [[14226 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until the hot water overflowed from the cup and scalded her hand that Su Tao cried out in pain and came back to her senses. [[14227 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Su Tao, are you okay?" [[14228 方柠 neutral]]
Su Tao forced a smile, "I'm fine, just haven't been resting well lately. Sit down for a while, I'll get you another cup of hot water." [[14229 苏桃 neutral]]
Perhaps it was because she hadn't had a good conversation with anyone for days, or maybe Fang Ning's well-behaved nature reminded her of Chi Xiaocheng, but Su Tao soon became friends with her as they sat on the sofa and chatted. [[14230 旁白 neutral]]
She intentionally tried to avoid topics related to Chi Xiaocheng. [[14231 旁白 neutral]]
But Fang Ning kept steering the conversation back to that topic. [[14232 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed that for her, Chi Xiaocheng was everything. [[14233 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao could truly feel the strong emotions she was expressing. [[14234 旁白 neutral]]
And because of that, her heart ached even more. [[14235 旁白 sad]]
This child was saved by Xiaocheng. How could she possibly tell her such a tragic story? [[14236 旁白 sad]]
There was no way she could say it! [[14237 旁白 sad]]
But she had to face what needed to be faced. [[14238 旁白 sad]]
After chatting for about an hour, Fang Ning asked innocently again, "Sister Su Tao, you still haven't told me when Sister Xiaocheng is coming back." [[14239 方柠 neutral]]
Su Tao lowered her head, tightening her grip on the cup in her hand. Her hair fell and hid her guilty eyes. "Xiaocheng... she went on a long trip. It'll probably be a while before she comes back." [[14240 苏桃 sad]]
Fang Ning asked, confused, "Did something happen?" [[14241 方柠 neutral]]
Su Tao replied, "Dongfang Yang needed Xiaocheng's help with something, so she went back to Beijing with him. I'm not sure when she'll be back, maybe in a month or two." [[14242 苏桃 sad]]
Fang Ning didn't suspect anything, but her voice became much more disappointed, "Okay then. When Sister Xiaocheng comes back, you must tell me, Sister Su Tao." [[14243 方柠 sad]]
"Okay." [[14244 苏桃 sad]]
Relieved that her excuse worked, Su Tao quickly stood up and asked, "By the way, are you going back so late? Should I get a guest room ready for you?" [[14245 苏桃 neutral]]
"No need." Fang Ning smiled sweetly. "I have an early shift tomorrow, so I need to wake up early. I'll go back to the school dormitory. Don't forget to tell me when Sister Xiaocheng is back." [[14246 方柠 happy]]
"Okay!" [[14247 苏桃 neutral]]
Smiling, Su Tao walked Fang Ning to the entrance of the residential complex and then slowly returned to the apartment. [[14248 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang--" The door closed heavily. Even with the air conditioning on, the living room felt cold and lonely to Su Tao. [[14249 旁白 sad]]
For now, she had only deceived Fang Ning. But what would happen once she learned the truth? [[14250 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao didn't dare to think about it, feeling the pressure spread through her body again. [[14251 旁白 sad]]
She forced a smile in front of others, hiding her pain inside, seeing nothing but endless loneliness and torment ahead. [[14252 旁白 sad]]
"So this is what it feels like to lose someone?" [[14253 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao walked back to the sofa, her gaze falling on the red stain on the blanket. [[14254 旁白 sad]]
The glass door had been replaced by the complex's security guard. While she was in the hospital, all the windows in the apartment had even been replaced with bulletproof glass. [[14255 旁白 neutral]]
But some things could never be erased. [[14256 旁白 sad]]
Just like before she met Chi Xiaocheng as a child, she had many friends, but none of them had eyes only for her like Chi Xiaocheng did. [[14257 旁白 sad]]
"If I had loved her from the very beginning, what would the ending have been like?" [[14258 苏桃 sad]]
Or maybe, this was the unique ending that God had given her? [[14259 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng didn't become a full yandere, she didn't kill the people around her one by one. [[14260 旁白 neutral]]
And it wasn't like the second dream, where she was tortured to death by Ye Liang. [[14261 旁白 neutral]]
But this third path she took, the one thing that couldn't be changed was... death. [[14262 旁白 sad]]
As Su Tao sat there dazed on the sofa, a fluffy ball rubbed against her foot. [[14263 旁白 neutral]]
A cute "meow" was followed by a "gurgle" from Da Wang's stomach. [[14264 旁白 neutral]]
When she wasn't home, Da Wang ate wild game outside. It hadn't eaten cat food for three days. [[14265 旁白 neutral]]
"Meow~~" [[14266 大王 neutral]]
Another sweet meow, and Su Tao instantly understood what the proud cat wanted. [[14267 旁白 neutral]]
It wanted to lick a cat treat. [[14268 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao helplessly picked up Da Wang, a faint, envious smile on her face, "I wish I could be as carefree as you." [[14269 苏桃 sad]]
The cat's presence added a bit of warmth to the empty room. [[14270 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang's bed was in a corner of Chi Xiaocheng's room. After carrying it back, Su Tao fed it. [[14271 旁白 neutral]]
The soothing cat eased some of her stress. [[14272 旁白 neutral]]
But this room, full of memories, still made Su Tao feel depressed. [[14273 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao reached into her pocket and took out her phone. [[14274 旁白 neutral]]
A small pill accidentally slipped out of her pocket along with it. [[14275 旁白 neutral]]
It was Chi Xiaocheng's stress-relief pill. [[14276 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stared at the pill, dazed, and suddenly found it a bit ridiculous. [[14277 旁白 neutral]]
If she had taken this pill back then, would things have ended differently? [[14278 旁白 sad]]
If she had let Xiaocheng lock her in the room, maybe they wouldn't have had that argument, and this wouldn't have happened on the balcony. [[14279 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao picked up the pill and threw it into her mouth. [[14280 旁白 neutral]]
Consider it... a late apology. [[14281 旁白 sad]]
After swallowing the pill, Su Tao turned and fell onto the bed, hugging the large brown teddy bear tightly. [[14282 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she was hugging Chi Xiaocheng, tighter and tighter. [[14283 旁白 sad]]
In the middle of the night, tears... streamed down again. [[14284 旁白 sad]]
What she didn't notice was that among the pile of dolls in the corner, a cute scarecrow doll was staring at her motionlessly. [[14285 旁白 neutral]]
Later that night, after she fell asleep, the doll magically took out a pair of glasses. [[14286 旁白 neutral]]
As the status-viewing glasses were put on, a stream of data slowly appeared in front of Chi Xiaocheng. [[14287 旁白 neutral]]
