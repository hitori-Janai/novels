Chapter 129: Her Love, From Beginning to End (Bonus Chapter) [[11364 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe she was tired from crying, or maybe the scented pouch was working, but Su Tao slept pretty well for the second half of the night. [[11365 旁白 neutral]]
Not only that, but she also had another dream. [[11366 旁白 neutral]]
In the dream, Chi Xiaocheng was just as obedient as she had been for the past half-month, nodding and agreeing to whatever she said. [[11367 旁白 neutral]]
For some reason, this level of obedience was starting to feel a little scary to Su Tao. [[11368 旁白 neutral]]
Her nerves were so on edge that she even felt like Chi Xiaocheng might be hiding a knife behind her obedient back. [[11369 旁白 sad]]
Thankfully, nothing like that happened. [[11370 旁白 neutral]]
She fully enjoyed Chi Xiaocheng's obedience and cuteness in her dream. Da Wang crawled into her bed in the middle of the night, and its warmth, mixed with the scent of the pouch, made her feel like she was holding the lovely girl. [[11371 旁白 happy]]
By the time she woke up the next day, her body and mind had recovered quite a bit. [[11372 旁白 neutral]]
Although you could still see she was worn out and had slight dark circles under her eyes. [[11373 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she left her room, Qian Qing glanced at her and commented lightly, "Looks like you slept well in the second half of the night. At least you don't look like you're about to die anymore." [[11374 钱清 neutral]]
"Thank you," Su Tao said again. She noticed the apron Qian Qing was wearing and the smell of porridge coming from the kitchen. [[11375 苏桃 neutral]]
"Miss Qian, did you make breakfast?" [[11376 苏桃 neutral]]
Qian Qing nodded faintly. "After all, I was ordered to take care of you, and takeout might not be nutritious enough. It's just that Dongfang Yang is coming over too, so he gets a free meal." [[11377 钱清 neutral]]
She really looked unwilling. [[11378 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao kept this kindness in her heart, quickly washing up and getting herself ready. [[11379 旁白 neutral]]
She was definitely going to the hospital today. If Chi Xiaocheng woke up, she didn't want her to see her looking so devastated. [[11380 旁白 neutral]]
After washing up, Su Tao wanted to help in the kitchen but was pushed out by Qian Qing. [[11381 旁白 neutral]]
Sitting on the sofa on an empty stomach, she took out the suicide note again. [[11382 旁白 sad]]
Every line of words deeply pierced her heart. [[11383 旁白 sad]]
Xiaocheng. [[11384 旁白 sad]]
She had long noticed that her mental state wasn't normal, but she kept smiling so I wouldn't worry. [[11385 旁白 sad]]
She knew I liked obedience, so for half a month she suppressed her yandere side, trying to please me by being well-behaved. [[11386 旁白 sad]]
She felt that my life was very busy, so for half a month she preferred not to go out so she wouldn't bother me. But every time I came back, she would give me a hug and a cute smile to heal my week's fatigue. [[11387 旁白 sad]]
Her confession was rejected, and she realized it would bring me pain. She would rather say goodbye quietly alone than let me suffer because of her yandere nature. [[11388 旁白 sad]]
Just like those two sentences said. [[11389 旁白 neutral]]
She gave her chains to me, and from then on, she had a reason to only have eyes for me. [[11390 旁白 neutral]]
The chains called "Yandere Love" were too heavy, so she wanted to go back to the beginning, preferring to suffer alone rather than hold me back. [[11391 旁白 sad]]
You said you were an uninvited wind, disturbing my peaceful days. [[11392 旁白 neutral]]
But you don't know that, most of the time, it was this warm, gentle breeze that took away my worries and loneliness. [[11393 旁白 neutral]]
It was a wind I could have caught, but I didn't even dare to reach out my hand. [[11394 旁白 sad]]
Especially the last part. [[11395 旁白 neutral]]
—Your little (crossed out). [[11396 旁白 neutral]]
—Xiaocheng. [[11397 旁白 neutral]]
Does this final departure mean you don't belong to me anymore? [[11398 旁白 sad]]
She placed the letter on her chest, as if trying to feel the elegant words through touch. [[11399 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao sighed with heartache, "That 'good night,' was it a farewell to the world, or a way of telling me we'd never see each other again?" [[11400 苏桃 sad]]
Qian Qing, holding a bowl of porridge, glanced at Su Tao. [[11401 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly began, "In romantic words, 'good night' has another meaning." [[11402 钱清 neutral]]
"Wan, an." [[11403 钱清 neutral]]
"The first letters can also be read as 'wo ai ni, ai ni' [I love you, love you]." [[11404 钱清 neutral]]
"Maybe it wasn't a farewell, but another kind of confession?" [[11405 钱清 neutral]]
Qian Qing brought out some light side dishes and untied her apron. "Time for breakfast. I don't want to eat with Dongfang Yang later." [[11406 钱清 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment, then broke into a tearful smile. [[11407 旁白 happy]]
Wiping away her tears, she asked, "Is Dongfang Yang a messy eater?" [[11408 苏桃 neutral]]
Qian Qing rolled her eyes. "He likes to burp when he eats." [[11409 钱清 neutral]]
"It seems like you two have a good relationship." [[11410 苏桃 neutral]]
Qian Qing pouted and handed Su Tao a tissue. "Alright, eat your breakfast. You don't want Chi Xiaocheng to wake up and see you looking like a mess, do you?" [[11411 钱清 neutral]]
"Mhm!" [[11412 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao nodded vigorously. After going through heaven and hell several times last night, and swinging between hope and despair, her body couldn't take it anymore. [[11413 旁白 neutral]]
Even though the lean-pork porridge was hot, she still gulped it down. [[11414 旁白 neutral]]
But her mind was still filled with the contents of the letter and Chi Xiaocheng's past smiles. [[11415 旁白 sad]]
After the two had nearly finished eating, Dongfang Yang finally arrived late. [[11416 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as he entered, he couldn't help but click his tongue and complain, "And here I came specifically to pick you up for the hospital, and you didn't even wait for me for breakfast!" [[11417 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao managed a faint smile. "Miss Qian said you burp when you eat." [[11418 苏桃 neutral]]
"That was when I was a kid. I've already gotten rid of that bad habit." Dongfang Yang casually sat down at the table and started eating a bun. "Even though your smile is forced, you can still joke, so it seems you're okay." [[11419 东方阳 neutral]]
"Much better. Thank you all so much!" [[11420 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao lowered her head, her tone sincere. [[11421 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang and Qian Qing looked at each other and smiled. [[11422 旁白 neutral]]
They didn't say much more. [[11423 旁白 neutral]]
After a full breakfast, Su Tao tidied up the living room again, and then left with Dongfang Yang, feeling her best. [[11424 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang said, "About what happened last night with you two being chased, Si Chen and I are already investigating. The police also said they will definitely give you an explanation, so don't worry." [[11425 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and finally voiced her suspicion, "I think... it might have been Lin Fangya. She's the only one I've had a conflict with recently." [[11426 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang said helplessly, "We've already found out it was her. But it wasn't just her. A rejected daughter from a second-rate family doesn't have the power to hire so many people to corner you." [[11427 东方阳 neutral]]
"There must be someone behind her. Si Chen is still trying to draw them out." [[11428 东方阳 neutral]]
After a short wait, the elevator doors opened, and a mother and a little girl came out holding a cake. [[11429 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang stood at the door and gave a cheerful smile. "Little girl, is it your birthday today?" [[11430 东方阳 happy]]
His friendly smile and handsome face quickly won the little girl over. She beamed, "It's my 5th birthday today! Big brother, do you want to come to my house for cake?" [[11431 小女孩 happy]]
"Hahaha, I won't take your cake. Happy birthday!" [[11432 东方阳 happy]]
After ruffling the little girl's hair, Dongfang Yang nudged Su Tao's shoulder and whispered, "What are you spacing out for? Let's go." [[11433 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao came back to her senses and forced a smile. "Happy birthday, little one." [[11434 苏桃 neutral]]
"Thank you, pretty sister! Do you live next door in 502? My mom and I are in 504. Remember to come for cake tonight!" [[11435 小女孩 happy]]
The mother smiled fondly. "This little one is quite energetic. Sorry about that. We just moved into 504, it's nice to meet you." [[11436 母亲 neutral]]
"Bye-bye, pretty sister!" [[11437 小女孩 happy]]
"Bye-bye." [[11438 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao stepped into the elevator and became silent again. [[11439 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at her, confused. "Why are you getting depressed again? Someone invited you for cake and you're still not happy?" [[11440 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips. "Sorry, I was just thinking that yesterday was also Xiaocheng's birthday." [[11441 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang opened his mouth, but didn't say anything comforting. "If you want to apologize, wait until you get to the hospital and tell her when she wakes up." [[11442 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded. "Mhm." [[11443 苏桃 happy]]
Not just an apology. [[11444 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps, a response to her confession as well. [[11445 旁白 neutral]]
