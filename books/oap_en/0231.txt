Chapter 231: That Was Supposed to Be My Spot! [[19871 旁白 sad]]
Ever since Su Tao had known this girl, she had never said much to her. [[19872 旁白 neutral]]
She only knew a little about how Chi Xiaocheng and Fang Ning met, how long they'd known each other, or what their relationship was like. [[19873 旁白 neutral]]
Most of her impressions of this girl were a complete blank. [[19874 旁白 neutral]]
The most they had ever talked was on that snowy night in front of her apartment building, after Xiaocheng died. [[19875 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning had given her a harsh scolding, and it was because of her that Su Tao slowly began to understand things. [[19876 旁白 neutral]]
The distance and rift between them started at that moment. [[19877 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking back, every time she came and went from the dorm, she used to hear a sweet "Sister Su Tao." [[19878 旁白 sad]]
But she had been under so much pressure that she ignored it every time she passed the dorm entrance. [[19879 旁白 sad]]
Wasn't that another case of her being warm and friendly, only for Su Tao to give her the cold shoulder? [[19880 旁白 sad]]
Seeing Fang Ning standing in the corner of the elevator, Su Tao stood at the door, unsure whether to enter or not. [[19881 旁白 neutral]]
But she wanted to see Xiaocheng, too. [[19882 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao braced herself and went in anyway. [[19883 旁白 neutral]]
But as soon as she walked in, Fang Ning, who had been facing the front of the elevator, suddenly turned away. [[19884 旁白 neutral]]
She faced the wall, showing only her profile to Su Tao. Her long hair, which reached her hips, hid her face, making her expression impossible to see. [[19885 旁白 neutral]]
The obvious little gesture seemed to be telling Su Tao, "I don't want to talk to you right now." [[19886 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, she was also here to see Xiaocheng. [[19887 旁白 neutral]]
After hesitating, Su Tao decided to speak to her. "Um, Fang Ning? You're here to see Xiaocheng, right? She's awake, you know." [[19888 苏桃 neutral]]
"I know," Fang Ning replied without turning around, her voice flat. [[19889 方柠 neutral]]
The unexpected reply left Su Tao stunned. [[19890 旁白 neutral]]
If their relationship had been like strangers before, then after Chi Xiaocheng's death, even that simple connection was broken. [[19891 旁白 neutral]]
In Fang Ning's eyes, her impression of Su Tao had sunk to a new low. [[19892 旁白 neutral]]
But she thought Fang Ning would be happy that Xiaocheng was awake, which was why she had brought it up. [[19893 旁白 neutral]]
But Fang Ning already knew? [[19894 旁白 neutral]]
Since when? Yesterday? [[19895 旁白 neutral]]
Before she could say anything, Fang Ning turned around and glanced at her. "I'll leave after I drop off the fruit. I won't disturb you two, so please don't come in with me, thank you." [[19896 方柠 neutral]]
Her words were filled with rejection. [[19897 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she was trying her best to sound indifferent. [[19898 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao could still hear a trace of anticipation in her words. [[19899 旁白 neutral]]
She was looking forward to seeing Chi Xiaocheng. [[19900 旁白 neutral]]
That feeling was probably just as strong as her own. [[19901 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze fell to the bag of fruit in Fang Ning's arms. There were three or four apples and one very bright, almost dazzlingly orange. [[19902 旁白 neutral]]
She seemed to be afraid that the fruit would fall. [[19903 旁白 neutral]]
She held the orange and the apples tightly in her arms. [[19904 旁白 neutral]]
*Ding.* The elevator doors opened. [[19905 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning lowered her head, her long hair hiding her expression, and quickly slipped out of the elevator, heading toward Chi Xiaocheng's room. [[19906 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao understood what she meant. [[19907 旁白 neutral]]
She only had a little time to see Xiaocheng before work. [[19908 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao had the whole day to spend with Xiaocheng. [[19909 旁白 neutral]]
So, since you have so much time, please don't disturb the little time that Sister Xiaocheng and I have. [[19910 旁白 neutral]]
Following Fang Ning out of the elevator, Su Tao lowered her head in silence, her steps slowing as she walked. [[19911 旁白 sad]]
She finally stopped at the corner before Chi Xiaocheng's room. [[19912 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know if Fang Ning was at the door to Xiaocheng's room. [[19913 旁白 neutral]]
Or if she had already gone inside. [[19914 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao would feel even more ashamed if Fang Ning saw her following her at a time like this. [[19915 旁白 sad]]
But she really wanted to know what they would talk about, and whether Xiaocheng would be as cold to Fang Ning as she was to her. [[19916 旁白 sad]]
She could cross the corner and walk to Chi Xiaocheng's room in a single step. [[19917 旁白 neutral]]
But that one step felt like an impossible gulf. [[19918 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao hesitated for a long time, but couldn't resist taking the step. [[19919 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning wasn't in front of the room. [[19920 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao breathed a sigh of relief. She was afraid that she would step out and see Fang Ning standing there, looking at the corner, and their eyes would meet. [[19921 旁白 neutral]]
What would they talk about then? [[19922 旁白 neutral]]
Sit together awkwardly? [[19923 旁白 neutral]]
Make some meaningless small talk? [[19924 旁白 neutral]]
They might even talk about things before Xiaocheng's amnesia, or even about her old self! [[19925 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's heart sank, and she hurried to the window of the hospital room. [[19926 旁白 neutral]]
She crouched down and peeked inside from a corner of the window. [[19927 旁白 neutral]]
What she saw next made her eyes widen in shock. [[19928 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng was sitting on the hospital bed, her pink lips moving constantly, gesturing with one hand. When she said something happy, she even tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. [[19929 旁白 neutral]]
Her expression showed an unstoppable happiness. [[19930 旁白 happy]]
Fang Ning was sitting on a small stool, also smiling. As they chatted, she cut a peeled apple into small slices for her. [[19931 旁白 happy]]
When she handed her a piece, the latter ate it naturally. [[19932 旁白 neutral]]
Judging by her mouth shape, she didn't even say "thank you." [[19933 旁白 neutral]]
Not saying thank you meant they were not distant. Perhaps this kind of interaction was already normal for them. [[19934 旁白 neutral]]
The morning sun streamed in, gently shining on the two girls. Dust motes floated in the air like scattered mist, creating a dreamlike and beautiful scene. [[19935 旁白 neutral]]
Just a moment ago, she had only felt a tightness in her chest. But after seeing this, Su Tao felt a sharp pain in her heart. [[19936 旁白 sad]]
She knew they weren't doing anything intimate. [[19937 旁白 neutral]]
They were probably just making small talk. [[19938 旁白 neutral]]
Because Chi Xiaocheng's memories of Fang Ning were ordinary, not painful, Fang Ning hadn't been erased from her jumbled memories. [[19939 旁白 neutral]]
So it was normal for them to chat like regular friends. [[19940 旁白 neutral]]
She should be happy that Xiaocheng had other friends to talk to. [[19941 旁白 sad]]
But why... [[19942 旁白 sad]]
Why did she feel so awful seeing such a simple interaction? [[19943 旁白 sad]]
That was supposed to be my spot! [[19944 旁白 sad]]
When Xiaocheng woke up, I was supposed to be the one by her side, chatting with her, peeling apples for her, feeding her, and talking about happy things until we both smiled. [[19945 旁白 sad]]
That script should have been mine! [[19946 旁白 angry]]
If Chi Xiaocheng didn't hate her, she wouldn't have felt this way. [[19947 旁白 sad]]
She would just see Fang Ning as one of Xiaocheng's friends, visiting her after she had recovered from a serious illness, which was perfectly reasonable. [[19948 旁白 neutral]]
But she had fallen from heaven to hell, only to watch someone else ascend to heaven and take her place. How could she possibly feel good? [[19949 旁白 sad]]
Everyone has a dark side. It's just that for most people, because of their personality and experiences, it's hidden very deep. [[19950 旁白 neutral]]
And comparisons can be hurtful. [[19951 旁白 neutral]]
When there's hurt, that hidden dark side is likely to be stirred up. [[19952 旁白 neutral]]
For some reason, Su Tao had a ridiculous thought. [[19953 旁白 angry]]
Her Xiaocheng was being stolen by Fang Ning. [[19954 旁白 angry]]
