Chapter 8: The Male Lead Who Was Stunned [[638 旁白 neutral]]
After ending the chat, Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved into a slight smile. [[639 池小橙 happy]]
Mentioning Su Tao and the basement, these male leads really couldn't sit still. [[640 池小橙 neutral]]
Without even guessing, Chi Xiaocheng knew that Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang were in competition, so he definitely wouldn't tell Dongfang Yang what happened in the basement. [[641 池小橙 neutral]]
And Su Tao would also hide the truth about what happened in the basement from both male leads. [[642 池小橙 neutral]]
To find out what happened in the basement, he'd have to go through either Ye Liang's bodyguards or through her, Chi Xiaocheng, the person involved! [[643 池小橙 neutral]]
Anyway, Dongfang Yang didn't know what the situation was. [[644 池小橙 neutral]]
What happened in the basement—couldn't she just make up whatever she wanted? [[645 池小橙 happy]]
As long as she could ask this male lead out, then there would be a chance to gain emotion points. [[646 池小橙 neutral]]
With emotion points to understand the future plot and buy skills, only then could she change her cannon fodder identity. [[647 池小橙 neutral]]
When her cannon fodder identity changed, she could go pursue the female lead. [[648 池小橙 happy]]
A perfect plan! [[649 池小橙 happy]]
But going out, naturally she still needed to dress up a bit. [[650 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng came to the wardrobe. There weren't too many clothes for going out inside. The summer clothes hanging there were just one dress, one JK uniform, and two sets of regular clothes for both going out and staying home. [[651 旁白 neutral]]
Even including the set she had just changed out of, as a girl's wardrobe, it was quite poor. [[652 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at the JK sailor uniform and short skirt, then decisively took down the white dress. [[653 池小橙 neutral]]
"I didn't expect that on just the first day of transmigrating, I'd have to wear such formal women's clothing." [[654 池小橙 neutral]]
Rustle, rustle. [[655 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took off her clothes and quickly changed into the new ones. [[656 池小橙 neutral]]
Her petite figure paired with the delicate white dress decorated with lace trim had quite a gothic style. The short outfit matched with her small features made her look as cute as a doll. [[657 旁白 neutral]]
The slightly short and narrow skirt could only cover down to her knee area below her snow-white thighs. [[658 旁白 neutral]]
Two slender and elegant beautiful legs were exposed to the air. [[659 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng faced the mirror, and the intermediate acting skill given by the system activated. Her face immediately gained a pitiful and delicate weakness. [[660 池小橙 neutral]]
Her naturally beautiful face and sickly image could easily win others' favor. [[661 旁白 neutral]]
Fine feathers make fine birds. [[662 旁白 neutral]]
"Obviously just wearing any decent outfit could have national goddess-level charm, but the original owner was really stupid, actually listening to those sisters and hiding all her good points." [[663 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng braided her soft tea-colored long hair into two ponytails, then found a pair of black-rimmed glasses with no prescription and put them on. [[664 池小橙 neutral]]
This delicate little loli gained an additional scholarly air and naturally cute temperament. [[665 旁白 neutral]]
After using white cloth to cover the wound on her palm, she went out. [[666 池小橙 neutral]]
November's late autumn was somewhat lonely, and the chilly wind made Chi Xiaocheng's thin body feel a bit cold. [[667 旁白 neutral]]
The white stockings on her legs were fine, providing quite a bit of warmth. [[668 旁白 neutral]]
Going out in just a dress was a bit careless—she should have added an undershirt. [[669 池小橙 neutral]]
The school gate on Sunday had few people, but even so, many gazes still fell on Chi Xiaocheng. [[670 旁白 neutral]]
Curious, surprised, longing, appreciative. [[671 旁白 neutral]]
Upon arriving at this public place, Chi Xiaocheng had already deployed her domain. [[672 池小橙 neutral]]
Acting skills exploded. [[673 池小橙 neutral]]
Like a lost little white rabbit, she clutched her small crossbody bag, keeping her head half-lowered but not so much that people couldn't see her makeup-free pretty face. [[674 池小橙 neutral]]
Then she walked straight toward Bamboo Cafe. [[675 池小橙 neutral]]
It wasn't actually far—just turn left at the school gate, right next to a large area of various shops inside the campus. "Who's that girl? She's so cute." [[676 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Does our school have such a cute girl? I've never seen her before." [[677 陌生男2 neutral]]
"Could she be from another school? Looking at how she doesn't know the way, she feels like a new student." [[678 陌生男3 neutral]]
The scattered discussions from people passing by made Chi Xiaocheng, who was keeping her head down, gradually smile. [[679 池小橙 happy]]
Changing others' impressions. [[680 池小橙 neutral]]
Influencing Su Tao through information from various channels. [[681 池小橙 neutral]]
Even noticing that some people were secretly taking photos of her profile, she didn't mind at all. [[682 池小橙 neutral]]
Having these photos would better spread the information. [[683 池小橙 happy]]
Soon, she arrived outside Bamboo Cafe. [[684 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng relied on her memory and noticed Dongfang Yang sitting impatiently inside the cafe. [[685 池小橙 neutral]]
Seeing him look over, Chi Xiaocheng quickly lowered her head. [[686 池小橙 neutral]]
She didn't go in. [[687 池小橙 neutral]]
Instead, she hesitated and lingered outside the door, as if she hadn't seen Dongfang Yang, pacing back and forth on her short legs. [[688 池小橙 neutral]]
Her extremely conflicted and cute appearance made even the young lady at the cafe counter rest her chin on her hand and watch her with smiling eyes. [[689 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's completely impatient expression finally gained a touch of curiosity. [[690 东方阳 neutral]]
Then he sneered, "Hesitating just to enter a cafe—who knows what countryside this idiot came from." [[691 东方阳 angry]]
He inexplicably somewhat disliked this tea-colored hair. [[692 东方阳 neutral]]
At the same time, he didn't recognize Chi Xiaocheng. [[693 旁白 neutral]]
Without makeup, with a different style, and the pure twin-tailed look that the original owner had never considered. [[694 旁白 neutral]]
Plus the black-rimmed glasses—except for those very familiar with her, from a distance you really couldn't tell it was her. [[695 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, Dongfang Yang saw this 1.5-meter idiot seem to make up her mind. [[696 东方阳 neutral]]
She lifted her delicate face, looking at the cafe door with determined eyes. [[697 池小橙 neutral]]
Resolutely stepping forward. [[698 池小橙 neutral]]
But with a stumble, she almost fell flat. [[699 池小橙 neutral]]
After hurriedly entering the cafe, she looked around again. [[700 池小橙 neutral]]
Walking toward him. [[701 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow, his gaze lingering for a moment on the white-stockinged legs beneath that skirt, then moving to Chi Xiaocheng's face as he asked in confusion, "You are...?" [[702 东方阳 neutral]]
He didn't remember knowing this cute, silly girl. [[703 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng slowly removed her black-rimmed glasses and shook the strands of bangs that half-covered her eyes. Her sealed beauty immediately bloomed. [[704 池小橙 neutral]]
She said weakly, "I... I'm Chi Xiaocheng." [[705 池小橙 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng?!" [[706 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang suddenly stood up. [[707 东方阳 neutral]]
His face full of shock. [[708 东方阳 neutral]]
[Male lead Dongfang Yang's heart received a huge shock due to the host's transformation] [[709 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +13...] [[710 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +16...] [[711 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +22...] [[712 系统 neutral]]
When the system's notification sounded, Chi Xiaocheng knew she had come to the right place. [[713 池小橙 happy]]
She nodded gently again, lowering her little head, "It's me." [[714 池小橙 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang was completely stunned. He couldn't believe that this person was actually Chi Xiaocheng! [[715 东方阳 neutral]]
The Chi Xiaocheng in his memory was hunched over, with lifeless eyes, wearing heavy makeup, and the kind where you couldn't recognize who she was just by looking at her face without seeing her hair. Her speech always carried a gunpowder-like tone. [[716 东方阳 neutral]]
Now [[717 旁白 neutral]]
He looked Chi Xiaocheng up and down and slowly managed to squeeze out a confused question, "Did you... did you get plastic surgery?" [[718 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lifted her face, stared into Dongfang Yang's eyes, pouted her small mouth, and said pitifully, "I... I know I'm ugly, but you can't say that about me. I... I just took off all my makeup." [[719 池小橙 sad]]
After speaking, she turned her head to the side and reached up to tuck the tea-colored strands falling by her temples behind her ear, revealing her clean and delicate profile. [[720 池小橙 sad]]
Her small cute ears were slightly pink, her long eyelashes kept blinking, and her grieved eyes seemed about to well up with tears. [[721 池小橙 sad]]
Ugly? [[722 东方阳 neutral]]
Just took off makeup? [[723 东方阳 neutral]]
Was this definitely the same person as the previous Chi Xiaocheng? [[724 东方阳 neutral]]
At this moment, Dongfang Yang was completely confused. [[725 东方阳 neutral]]
