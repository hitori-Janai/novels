Chapter 171: Even if I regret it, I must live for her [[14951 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's death wasn't the end of the story. As one of the leaders of Jiuzhou City, his death left behind a huge mess. [[14952 旁白 neutral]]
The local families that had been lying low began to surface, trying every way to get a piece of Ye Liang's legacy to strengthen themselves. [[14953 旁白 neutral]]
The underworld forces, unable to operate in the open, began to test the boundaries between the legal and illegal. [[14954 旁白 neutral]]
The Ye family from the capital didn't seem to want to get involved in Jiuzhou City's situation and didn't send a new person to take over. [[14955 旁白 neutral]]
With such a major event, it was impossible for the officials of the Great Zhou Kingdom to do nothing. The entire Jiuzhou City was under a subtle martial law, ensuring no open turmoil would occur. [[14956 旁白 neutral]]
But what was happening behind the scenes was unknown. [[14957 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya and Xiao Ming were still missing. [[14958 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's family started to interfere, forcing him to make a public appearance. [[14959 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen should have been happy to take over Ye Liang's forces, but he was extremely dissatisfied with one of Chi Song's actions. [[14960 旁白 neutral]]
In the meeting room, he yelled at Chi Song and Brother Long, "I told you not to kill Ye Liang! Su Tao's father is a very important person. If we can find him, your gang won't have to fear these small families anymore." [[14961 司辰 angry]]
"Why don't you understand?!" [[14962 司辰 angry]]
Si Chen was furious, "You killed Ye Liang, and the Ye family from the capital has to save face. They will definitely cause trouble for you. Dongfang Yang and I are too busy to help. Who can protect you now? Su Tao's father is the only solution!" [[14963 司辰 angry]]
He had his own selfish reasons, but he was also telling the truth. [[14964 旁白 neutral]]
However, Brother Long wasn't flustered at all. [[14965 旁白 neutral]]
What had happened recently was like a normal tea time for him. He said calmly, "Don't worry about us. I have my own way of dealing with the Ye family's revenge." [[14966 龙哥 neutral]]
Chi Song lowered his head and said, "It's my fault. I had to avenge my little sister. Every extra day he lived was another day of uncertainty. Even if I had to do it again, I would still shoot." [[14967 池松 sad]]
Then, Brother Long seemed to remember something and asked, "Besides Ye Liang, an old man also died up there. Who was he?" [[14968 龙哥 neutral]]
Si Chen replied irritably, "He was Ye Liang's guardian. Just a bunch of old guys living in the past, unwilling to face reality." [[14969 司辰 angry]]
Seeing their confusion, he explained helplessly, "Just think of him as a martial arts master. Families like ours that have been passed down for generations always have something special. That old man was a martial arts master, but they prefer to call themselves ancient martial artists." [[14970 司辰 neutral]]
"They have good bloodlines and strengthen themselves through training and taking drugs. But even at their peak, they can only dodge a bullet. There are no limits in this world. It sounds impressive, but you can take them down with any gun." [[14971 司辰 neutral]]
"In short, they're just bodyguards who are good at close combat. Nothing special." [[14972 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen took a sip of tea, "Instead of worrying about that, let's think about someone else. What about Su Tao?" [[14973 司辰 neutral]]
At these words, all three of them fell silent. [[14974 旁白 neutral]]
Hate can sustain a person's spirit, but what happens when that hate is gone? [[14975 旁白 neutral]]
Two days had passed since Ye Liang's death. [[14976 旁白 neutral]]
Before, Su Tao had tried to keep herself going. Even though she was not in a good state mentally, she knew she couldn't let her body fail if she wanted revenge. [[14977 旁白 neutral]]
So she tried hard to recover. [[14978 旁白 neutral]]
Otherwise, her weak body wouldn't have been able to challenge Ye Liang. [[14979 旁白 neutral]]
Back then, she was still living like a "person." [[14980 旁白 neutral]]
But now, the target of her hatred was gone. [[14981 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng was also gone. [[14982 旁白 sad]]
Her once full life had become empty. [[14983 旁白 sad]]
She never left Chi Xiaocheng's house. [[14984 旁白 neutral]]
She ordered takeout when she was hungry and slept on Chi Xiaocheng's bed when she was tired. [[14985 旁白 neutral]]
When she had nothing to do, she would hug a photo of Chi Xiaocheng and sit on the sofa in a daze. Even when Si Chen and Dongfang Yang visited, she didn't change. [[14986 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, there was still a cat in the house. The King's dependence on her occasionally brought a different emotion to the girl's empty eyes. [[14987 旁白 neutral]]
But this cat had also become one of the "items" of her memories. [[14988 旁白 sad]]
After all, that cat cafe also held memories she couldn't let go of. [[14989 旁白 sad]]
Just like that, she lost her social life, her outdoor activities, and her motivation to live. [[14990 旁白 sad]]
"Ding," Su Tao's WeChat notification sounded. [[14991 旁白 neutral]]
It was a message from her friend, Cheng Cheng. [[14992 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey, Taozi, it's time to pull yourself together. The dead can't be brought back. I understand how you feel, but you can't just stay at home all day, right?" [[14993 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao just glanced at the message on her phone, then lay back on the sofa, hugging the King. [[14994 苏桃 sad]]
Her gaze was fixed on a corner of the red blanket that had never been changed. [[14995 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed Cheng Cheng realized Su Tao wouldn't reply. [[14996 旁白 neutral]]
A WeChat call came in. [[14997 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello, Cheng Cheng, what's up?" [[14998 苏桃 sad]]
This wasn't the first time she had talked with Cheng Cheng on the phone. [[14999 旁白 neutral]]
On the other end of the line was a clear and cheerful voice, "What else could it be? Of course, I'm here to comfort you. Did you know that Young Master Dongfang came to find me?" [[15000 程程 happy]]
"How did he find you? Your school is more than ten kilometers away, right?" [[15001 苏桃 neutral]]
"Who knows what's wrong with that guy. He said he wanted to donate a library to my school. You told me about him before, so I recognized him and said hi. Who knew he would be more excited than me." [[15002 程程 happy]]
Cheng Cheng's voice was full of trouble and helplessness, "He asked me to persuade you as an online friend not to be alone and overthink things." [[15003 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao's voice lacked its usual passion, her tone like an old woman's, "Forget it. The house has Xiaocheng's scent. There's nothing outside." [[15004 苏桃 sad]]
"If I were Xiaocheng and saw you like this, I definitely wouldn't recognize you as my sister if I came back to life." [[15005 程程 sad]]
"Xiaocheng won't really come back to life. Cheng Cheng, if there's nothing else, I'm hanging up." [[15006 苏桃 sad]]
"Hey, wait a minute!" [[15007 程程 neutral]]
The voice on the phone hurriedly said, "Even though your Xiaocheng is gone, you have to live well. Otherwise, you won't even be able to remember her. If you don't live for her, how will you face her brother and parents?" [[15008 程程 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng continued, "She must have had many things she wanted to do. You should at least fulfill her last wishes. Are you going to be a shut-in at home for the rest of your life, just thinking about her?" [[15009 程程 neutral]]
"If you become like this, she probably wouldn't even want to visit you in your dreams." [[15010 程程 sad]]
Perhaps the words "last wishes" struck a chord with Su Tao. Her listless body finally moved a little. [[15011 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly walked to the balcony, feeling the cold wind on her face, "But what should I do? Now that Xiaocheng is gone, nothing feels necessary anymore." [[15012 苏桃 sad]]
"My dear sister, you still have to live. There are only three days until winter break. Are you going to continue staying at home?" [[15013 程程 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng sighed on the phone, "Forget it. I guess saying this won't lift your spirits. Let's pick a place. How about that cat cafe you told me about last time?" [[15014 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment, "Pick a place for what?" [[15015 苏桃 neutral]]
"To meet up, of course. My advisor gave me a three-hour break, so I can come out and play." Cheng Cheng left a final sentence, "In ten minutes, get out of the house immediately!" [[15016 程程 happy]]
