Chapter 102: Betrayal [[8811 旁白 neutral]]
Her hair was dyed brownish-yellow, and her familiar, delicate face wore exquisite makeup. Even after so much time had passed, Chi Xiaocheng still remembered that face clearly. [[8812 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she had imagined, her past self was holding roses. Such an unexpected encounter would catch anyone off guard. [[8813 旁白 neutral]]
All her expectations shattered into pieces on the ground. [[8814 旁白 sad]]
"Yiran, this isn't real, is it? Is this man your brother or your father?" [[8815 池小橙 sad]]
The words of the figure holding the roses were filled with disbelief. Before her girlfriend could even speak, she had already made an excuse for her. [[8816 旁白 neutral]]
The man with the gold chain, who had his arm around the girlfriend, paused for a moment and then burst out laughing. "Yiran, look at this dog you've raised for two years. You said it wouldn't work at first, but isn't this quite a success!" [[8817 金链男人 happy]]
Yiran crossed her arms and looked mockingly at her former self. "Alright, A'cheng, since you've caught me, I won't hide it anymore. It's just as you see. I've never liked you." [[8818 怡然 angry]]
The white roses in her hand fell to the ground, and her voice trembled as she spoke. "No... Yiran, this isn't real, right? You're pranking me with him, right? You knew it was our two-year anniversary, so this is just a prank, right?" [[8819 池小橙 sad]]
"You love me so much, how could you possibly betray me!" [[8820 池小橙 sad]]
The shout was not one of anger, but of denial. [[8821 旁白 neutral]]
The surrounding pedestrians, who had seemed to vanish, reappeared at this moment, gathering around and pointing at the blurry figure. [[8822 旁白 neutral]]
The girlfriend and the man with the gold chain exchanged a look and both burst into wild laughter. [[8823 旁白 neutral]]
"Hahahaha! A'cheng, you're really so stupid. I haven't liked you at all for these two years. Didn't you ever realize that all my affection for you was just an act?" [[8824 怡然 happy]]
The man with the gold chain released his girlfriend and walked step by step towards the blurry figure. [[8825 旁白 neutral]]
He opened his mouth, revealing yellowed teeth. "Kid, since today is your two-year anniversary, I'll tell you the truth." [[8826 金链男人 happy]]
He grinned. "Your girlfriend, Yiran, has been my dog for two years... oh no, even longer than that. Do you know why she 'liked' you?" [[8827 金链男人 happy]]
"Of course, it was because I ordered her to!" [[8828 金链男人 happy]]
The blurry figure's eyes widened, the light in them slowly fading until they became empty. [[8829 旁白 sad]]
Meanwhile, Chi Xiaocheng stood to the side, her brows tightly furrowed. [[8830 旁白 angry]]
She had no memory of this scene at all. [[8831 旁白 neutral]]
How could this lucid dream be so disgusting? [[8832 池小橙 angry]]
In her memories of her past life, after seeing the two of them and questioning them, Chi Xiaocheng broke up with her decisively once she knew she had been cheated on. [[8833 旁白 neutral]]
Her face was cold as she continued to frown at the man with the gold chain and her ex-girlfriend. [[8834 旁白 angry]]
The man with the gold chain spread his hands, a victor's smile on his face. "But it's normal that you can't accept it. Who could imagine that their innocent little girlfriend is actually someone else's dog?" [[8835 金链男人 happy]]
"Hahahaha! But the truth is cruel, kid." The man with the gold chain waved his hand, beckoning the ex-girlfriend over. "Hey, Yiran, you tell her why you 'liked' her." [[8836 金链男人 happy]]
The ex-girlfriend crossed her arms, sighed, and said, "A'cheng, you know, my 'liking' you back then was just on a whim. It was just to see the look on your face today." [[8837 怡然 angry]]
"To have you fall hopelessly in love with me, only to find out that I never liked you at all." [[8838 怡然 angry]]
"You remember all the little things I did to show my love, right? You're so ordinary, why would I pour all my love into you? Because I was pretending!" [[8839 怡然 angry]]
"I'd forgotten it was our two-year anniversary until you mentioned it." [[8840 怡然 neutral]]
"So, how does it feel, going from heaven to hell?" [[8841 怡然 happy]]
Not just the blurry figure, but Chi Xiaocheng herself couldn't help but fall into her memories. [[8842 旁白 neutral]]
Her ex-girlfriend had been perfect. [[8843 旁白 neutral]]
Gentle, considerate, never threw tantrums, and never interfered with her life. After discovering their hobbies were different, she took the initiative to learn and accept her hobbies. She was like a dream girlfriend from a 2D world. [[8844 旁白 neutral]]
And now, she was saying that such perfection was just an act? [[8845 旁白 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's face darkened. The blurry figure was already questioning them as if going crazy. [[8846 旁白 angry]]
Who could accept that the girlfriend they had loved for two years was actually someone else's plaything, and had only started dating them because of someone else's orders? [[8847 旁白 neutral]]
Not to mention, the former Chi Xiaocheng had truly poured all her feelings into the relationship. [[8848 旁白 sad]]
Even while in school, she worked various part-time jobs, planning for life after graduation, and even for a future marriage. [[8849 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was an orphan and had never felt much love. This first love in college had given her almost everything she had ever wanted. [[8850 旁白 sad]]
And the result... [[8851 旁白 sad]]
The blurry figure, just as the man with the gold chain had mocked, was like a dejected, homeless puppy. [[8852 旁白 sad]]
A light rain began to fall from the sky, as if grieving for someone. [[8853 旁白 sad]]
And the blurry figure let the rain beat down on her. [[8854 旁白 sad]]
"If you didn't like me, why did you pour everything into loving me?" [[8855 池小橙 sad]]
The figure asked the question without looking up. [[8856 旁白 neutral]]
Two years of time turned out to be such a fragile bubble. [[8857 旁白 sad]]
The ex-girlfriend looked down, gently stroking the figure's head, and said in a low voice that the man with the gold chain couldn't hear, "A'cheng, it's because I also wanted to feel what it's like for someone to give all their love to me. So I just borrowed the love you would have given to someone in the future." [[8858 怡然 sad]]
She stood up, her hands behind her back. "A'cheng, you know, I sometimes wonder, you love me so much you would give up everything for me. If one day I were to die in front of you, what would your reaction be?" [[8859 怡然 neutral]]
"I really want to try that." [[8860 怡然 neutral]]
"But I'm sorry, I don't have the courage to die." [[8861 怡然 sad]]
"And I wanted to see the look on your face when you, who love me to death, were betrayed by me." [[8862 怡然 happy]]
She smiled sweetly. "Although I never liked you, I really enjoyed your love." [[8863 怡然 happy]]
Her gentle words were like a sharp sword, piercing the blurry figure's heart and causing Chi Xiaocheng's expression to grow even darker. [[8864 旁白 angry]]
The girlfriend she once loved deeply was someone else's plaything. [[8865 旁白 angry]]
The feelings she had given everything for had become her girlfriend's plaything. [[8866 旁白 angry]]
One thought leads to heaven, another to hell. This was it. [[8867 旁白 neutral]]
Even though Chi Xiaocheng knew the contents of this dream might be fabricated, for some reason, the anger in her heart couldn't be stopped. [[8868 旁白 angry]]
"Kill them!" [[8869 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng blurted it out, encouraging the blurry figure. [[8870 旁白 neutral]]
Even she didn't understand why she was so angry, even to the point of genuinely wanting to kill these two people, when it was just a dream. [[8871 旁白 angry]]
"This is just a dream. You can do whatever you want." Chi Xiaocheng came to the blurry figure's side, her voice like a demon's whisper. "This woman will never love you. Kill this shameless pair, end it all, and then find a better girl." [[8872 池小橙 angry]]
The blurry figure didn't move, but as if it could truly hear Chi Xiaocheng's voice, it murmured, "No one in this world likes me anyway. What good would finding a better girl do?" [[8873 池小橙 sad]]
"Then possess her completely. Do whatever it takes to make her yours and yours alone!" [[8874 池小橙 angry]]
The image of Su Tao suddenly flashed through Chi Xiaocheng's mind. [[8875 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, from the moment she transmigrated and merged with the original Xiaocheng's memories. [[8876 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew that Su Tao was that better girl. [[8877 旁白 neutral]]
She bent over, tilting her head to look at the man with the gold chain and her ex-girlfriend, and slowly handed a knife to her former self. [[8878 旁白 angry]]
