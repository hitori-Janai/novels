Chapter 187: The other side of the dream is reality. [[16311 旁白 neutral]]
What would eternal happiness be like? [[16312 苏桃 neutral]]
Would it always be like this? Happy, warm, and enchanting? [[16313 苏桃 happy]]
Just as she didn't know what "like" truly meant, Su Tao didn't have a clear understanding of happiness. [[16314 旁白 neutral]]
She just saw this warm, relaxing feeling and the smile of the person before her as happiness. [[16315 旁白 neutral]]
If only this moment could last forever... [[16316 苏桃 happy]]
She suddenly tightened her grip on Chi Xiaocheng's hand. [[16317 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, let's go on the Ferris wheel!" [[16318 苏桃 happy]]
She wanted to hold onto this happiness forever. [[16319 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing her looking so anxious, Chi Xiaocheng chuckled softly. "We have to wait in line, there's no rushing it. Everyone knows about the legend. So many people want to reach the peak at this beautiful moment as the sun sets, before night arrives." [[16320 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao looked up and noticed the long line for the Ferris wheel. It was uncertain if they could get on before sunset. [[16321 旁白 neutral]]
If night falls and dusk is gone, will the legend still work? Will it still be eternal? [[16322 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao felt a bit anxious and pulled Chi Xiaocheng toward the crowd in line. [[16323 旁白 neutral]]
The line wasn't endless, but the Ferris wheel's speed felt incredibly slow to Su Tao. Her anxiety grew stronger with a sense of foreboding. [[16324 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stood obediently by her side, and while holding Su Tao's hand, she could feel a slight dampness from her sweaty palm. [[16325 旁白 neutral]]
She really wanted to preserve this eternity, afraid the sun would set, afraid that by the time she stepped onto the Ferris wheel, there would be no sunlight, and the legend would vanish like a bubble. [[16326 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, it was just a legend, but since Tao Tao had this wish... [[16327 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng would wait with her. [[16328 旁白 neutral]]
She took the lollipop she had been holding in her mouth out. [[16329 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the girl's nervousness, Chi Xiaocheng offered it to her, "Want some?" [[16330 池小橙 neutral]]
Her eyes held a reassuring calm, as if she were repeating the words she had said countless times—no matter what happens, I will always be by your side. [[16331 旁白 neutral]]
The round lollipop had become small. [[16332 旁白 neutral]]
The original feeling of anxiety in her heart gradually subsided. [[16333 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you, Xiaocheng." [[16334 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao loosened her grip on her hand, and with her other hand, she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and lowered her head to put the lollipop in her mouth. [[16335 旁白 neutral]]
Then she heard Chi Xiaocheng's gentle comfort, "Don't worry, we'll definitely make it." [[16336 池小橙 happy]]
"Mhm." [[16337 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao held the lollipop stick with her right hand. [[16338 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze fell involuntarily on Chi Xiaocheng's cute face. [[16339 旁白 neutral]]
Her tongue swirled. [[16340 旁白 neutral]]
So sweet. [[16341 苏桃 happy]]
Time passed bit by bit. A pale moon gradually hung in a corner of the sky, and starlight seemed ready to break through the clouds. [[16342 旁白 neutral]]
In the final moments of dusk, the clouds were dyed a blood-like crimson. [[16343 旁白 neutral]]
Other tourists around couldn't help but take out their phones, aiming them at the dreamlike scene in the sky. [[16344 旁白 neutral]]
They also aimed at the ascending cars of the Ferris wheel. [[16345 旁白 neutral]]
Then, the sun began to set. [[16346 旁白 neutral]]
After waiting in line for a long time, they finally caught the very end of it. Su Tao let out a long sigh of relief, "Great, we made it." [[16347 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced sideways, and they smiled at each other. "Then let's go, our happiness is within reach." [[16348 池小橙 happy]]
The Ferris wheel car carrying them slowly rose into the air. Chi Xiaocheng stood by the window, looking down. Everything became smaller as they ascended, as if the whole world was shrinking. [[16349 旁白 neutral]]
It was Chi Xiaocheng's first time on a Ferris wheel. This strange feeling made her exclaim in amazement, "You can really feel the pull of gravity disappearing, and everything starts to shrink. It's so magical, so beautiful." [[16350 池小橙 happy]]
"Yeah." Su Tao was also standing by the window, but she wasn't looking at the scenery outside, but at the cute girl beside her. [[16351 苏桃 happy]]
While looking down and seeing the world become small, one also felt that happiness was right by their side. [[16352 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps this is what 'like' feels like. [[16353 旁白 neutral]]
Being by her side felt enjoyable, happy, comfortable, and satisfying. [[16354 旁白 neutral]]
The car rose high into the air, and it was unclear when it would come down. Time passed, and the sensation was clear. [[16355 旁白 neutral]]
Could the time spent at the top, without falling, also be called eternity? [[16356 旁白 neutral]]
It was very quiet around them. Su Tao could even hear Chi Xiaocheng's faint breathing. [[16357 旁白 neutral]]
As the car climbed, the last rays of the sunset shone upon them. [[16358 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao slowly came back to her senses and called out softly, "Xiaocheng." [[16359 苏桃 neutral]]
"Hm?" [[16360 池小橙 neutral]]
The hand she was holding had been released at some point. Chi Xiaocheng turned around and looked up slightly at Su Tao. [[16361 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled without a word, waiting for the girl to speak. [[16362 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao did not disappoint her. [[16363 旁白 neutral]]
"We're almost at the top." [[16364 苏桃 neutral]]
She really wanted to carve the word "eternal" onto this happiness. [[16365 旁白 neutral]]
This time, her initiative was different from before. [[16366 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't that she had never been proactive before, but that was when pressure pushed her to the limit, and she sought the girl to numb herself and relieve the stress. [[16367 旁白 neutral]]
Like after a long day, needing to dive into a gentle embrace for relief. [[16368 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, the initiative was about wanting to keep her by her side forever. [[16369 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a small step to the side to avoid being too close to the window. A shy blush appeared on her face, and she hummed a soft "mhm," like the buzz of a mosquito. [[16370 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao knew this was a signal. [[16371 旁白 neutral]]
The Ferris wheel was still rising. [[16372 旁白 neutral]]
The brilliant clouds seemed to be right before their eyes. [[16373 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stared motionlessly at Chi Xiaocheng. In this small space, her eyes were truly filled with her. [[16374 旁白 neutral]]
And because of that, she didn't notice. [[16375 旁白 neutral]]
As the car climbed towards the highest point, the sunlight shining on them was gradually dimming. [[16376 旁白 neutral]]
Time passed very slowly, and yet very quickly. [[16377 旁白 neutral]]
She could clearly feel her own heart pounding with excitement, a flutter and nervousness she had never felt before. [[16378 旁白 neutral]]
It was just a kiss. [[16379 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know how many times they had done it before. [[16380 旁白 neutral]]
It wouldn't even be an exaggeration to say she was skilled at it. [[16381 旁白 neutral]]
But for no reason at all, she still felt her heart race. [[16382 旁白 neutral]]
The space around them compressed as she and she got closer and closer. [[16383 旁白 neutral]]
As the slight feeling of weightlessness from the car's ascent came to a halt, Su Tao knew that her car with Chi Xiaocheng had reached the highest point of the entire Ferris wheel. [[16384 旁白 neutral]]
She proactively reached out her hand towards Chi Xiaocheng. [[16385 旁白 neutral]]
However... [[16386 旁白 neutral]]
Just as her hand was about to touch the other's cheek. [[16387 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if a shadow rippled in front of her. Su Tao took a step forward and lunged at empty air. [[16388 旁白 neutral]]
The hand reaching for the cheek passed right through. She was like air, and no matter how Su Tao struggled, she couldn't touch her. [[16389 旁白 neutral]]
The girl's eyes, in that instant, became filled with terror. [[16390 旁白 sad]]
She turned, only to find that half of her own body had also passed through Chi Xiaocheng. [[16391 旁白 sad]]
"Xiao... Xiaocheng?" Su Tao staggered back two steps in shock, only to realize that Chi Xiaocheng was slowly turning transparent, about to fade away like starlight. [[16392 苏桃 sad]]
And the last ray of sunset vanished as the car began its descent. [[16393 旁白 sad]]
The dim moonlight had not yet brightened, and the world seemed to have fallen into its darkest moment. [[16394 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a step back helplessly, looking at Su Tao with a regretful smile, "The dream is about to end." [[16395 池小橙 sad]]
