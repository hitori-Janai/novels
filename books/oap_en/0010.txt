Chapter 10: The Threat [[808 旁白 neutral]]
After the villain Chi Xiaocheng is written out in the next ten chapters, a new villain naturally has to appear to attract the readers' hatred. [[809 旁白 neutral]]
One of Su Tao's current best friends—Chen Qian! [[810 旁白 neutral]]
She's the new villain who appears in those later chapters. [[811 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian met Su Tao in college and perfectly played the part of a sweet, innocent girl. [[812 旁白 neutral]]
In front of Su Tao, she was a great friend who seemed to share everything. [[813 旁白 neutral]]
But behind Su Tao's back, she was a demon consumed by jealousy. [[814 旁白 neutral]]
She and Ye Liang came from the same high school. Although her family was average, Chen Qian always wanted to date someone out of her league and had long seen Ye Liang as her boyfriend. [[815 旁白 neutral]]
But just two months into college, Ye Liang was completely charmed by Su Tao. [[816 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian was furious. Why should an orphan from the countryside like Su Tao get all of Ye Liang's attention! [[817 旁白 angry]]
In the original novel, the school basketball game was two days later. [[818 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang and Ye Liang were playing as opponents. [[819 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's face had been scratched up by Chi Xiaocheng, but she still insisted on going to cheer for them both. [[820 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian thought that with Su Tao's face ruined and her incredible beauty gone, Ye Liang couldn't possibly like her. [[821 旁白 neutral]]
So she schemed to embarrass Su Tao at the game and later pushed her down the stairs, making things even worse for the already injured heroine. [[822 旁白 neutral]]
"This 'best friend' is someone I can definitely use!" [[823 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng clenched her fist, a wicked smile on her face. [[824 旁白 neutral]]
"According to the plot, she's Su Tao's roommate. It's the perfect chance to visit her dorm. If the female lead is there, I can put some pressure on her and farm more Emotion Points." [[825 池小橙 neutral]]
Without hesitation, Chi Xiaocheng turned around and headed toward the girls' dormitory. [[826 旁白 neutral]]
Tianhe Courtyard, Building 4. [[827 旁白 neutral]]
Her dorm was in the same building, just a bit far from Su Tao's. She was in room 513, and Su Tao was in 801. [[828 旁白 neutral]]
Since the school wasn't far from her home, Chi Xiaocheng had permission to live off-campus and only occasionally stayed in the dorm. [[829 旁白 neutral]]
Arriving at room 801 by elevator, Chi Xiaocheng noticed the door was ajar. She peeked through the crack and saw a shocking scene. [[830 旁白 neutral]]
A girl was adding some kind of white powder to a cup of water! [[831 旁白 neutral]]
The cup had little peach stickers on it—wasn't that Su Tao's cup? [[832 旁白 neutral]]
Who else could the culprit be but Chen Qian? [[833 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng secretly took out her phone. [[834 旁白 neutral]]
"Click—" [[835 旁白 neutral]]
The sound startled Chen Qian inside. "Who's there!" [[836 陈倩 angry]]
Seeing the small girl with pigtails, Chen Qian quickly hid the cup behind her back and snapped, "Who are you? Why are you taking pictures of me!" [[837 陈倩 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng pushed the door open, a relaxed smile on her lips. "I was originally looking for Su Tao, but this is a nice surprise. Sister, it's not very nice to be drugging someone's drink, is it?" [[838 池小橙 neutral]]
"Who... who's drugging anything!" [[839 陈倩 sad]]
Chen Qian denied it while secretly stuffing the packet of powder into her back pocket. [[840 旁白 neutral]]
She glared fiercely at Chi Xiaocheng, trying to scare her. [[841 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled faintly and held up her phone. "I have proof, you know." [[842 池小橙 happy]]
"You—" [[843 陈倩 angry]]
Chen Qian remembered the camera sound from just now, and her face turned pale. After staring at Chi Xiaocheng's face for a moment, she exclaimed in shock, "You're Chi Xiaocheng?!" [[844 陈倩 sad]]
"Who I am doesn't matter," Chi Xiaocheng said coolly. "What matters is, what do you think Ye Liang will think if I send this photo to him?" [[845 池小橙 neutral]]
"Oh, right!" Chi Xiaocheng glanced at Su Tao's bed. "There are so many men's items up there. I wonder if someone planned to take photos and spread them around to frame Su Tao for being indecent." [[846 池小橙 neutral]]
"Gosh, if Ye Liang found out about this, he would be so angry~" [[847 池小橙 happy]]
"And a certain someone would never have a chance again, right?" [[848 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stared directly at Chen Qian, threats spilling from her lips. "Don't even think about snatching my phone. If I scream for help, do you believe all the girls in this building will come running to see the drama?" [[849 池小橙 angry]]
Chen Qian's expression was dark. She had no idea how Chi Xiaocheng knew she liked Ye Liang. [[850 旁白 neutral]]
But everything she said was exactly what Chen Qian feared. [[851 旁白 neutral]]
With no other choice, she had to give in. "What do you want, money?" [[852 陈倩 sad]]
"Don't be nervous. We're on the same side." [[853 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng pulled up a chair, locked the door behind her, and said calmly to Chen Qian, "Like you, I want Su Tao to stay away from Ye Liang. You want to frame her, ruin her reputation, and win Ye Liang's affection, right?" [[854 池小橙 neutral]]
"So what if I do?" [[855 陈倩 angry]]
"I can help you!" Chi Xiaocheng revealed her sharp little canine teeth, a villain's signature smile on her small face. "You know my name, so you must know about my situation." [[856 池小橙 happy]]
"But don't you like Ye Liang too?" Chen Qian was very wary. "You're also my rival!" [[857 陈倩 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed. "The problem right now is that Ye Liang is completely focused on Su Tao. You don't need to worry about whether I like him or not." [[858 池小橙 neutral]]
Then, she clicked her tongue. "Whatever, why am I saying so much? You don't really think you have a choice, do you?" [[859 池小橙 neutral]]
She shook her phone again. [[860 旁白 neutral]]
Then she tossed over a bottle of water she had just bought. "Drink this." [[861 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian frowned, bending down to pick up the mineral water. "Nongfu Spring?" [[862 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled slightly. "You drink first." [[863 池小橙 neutral]]
Although she didn't know what Chi Xiaocheng was planning, Chen Qian had no choice but to do as she was told. [[864 旁白 neutral]]
But as she drank the water, she suddenly realized something was wrong. Her face went pale. "Why is this water so bitter!" [[865 陈倩 sad]]
Chen Qian's eyes widened in disbelief as she looked at the packaging. [[866 旁白 neutral]]
It was Nongfu Spring! [[867 旁白 neutral]]
And the bottle hadn't even been opened. Was it expired? [[868 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, she didn't know that Chi Xiaocheng had already used her liquid-altering skill to change the water's taste before giving it to her. [[869 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a special poison I made. I was going to save it for Su Tao, but for now, I'll use it to control you." [[870 池小橙 neutral]]
"Poison?!" [[871 陈倩 sad]]
"Yes," Chi Xiaocheng nodded. "You need to take an antidote once a week, or the flesh on your face will start to rot." [[872 池小橙 neutral]]
As soon as she said that... [[873 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian was so scared she immediately threw the water bottle aside. [[874 旁白 neutral]]
Then she covered her mouth and frantically tried to make herself vomit. [[875 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng calmly picked up the half-empty bottle. "I know you want to go after Su Tao, but don't be in such a hurry. For now, just maintain your good-friend relationship with her. I'll find a way to make her leave Ye Liang." [[876 池小橙 neutral]]
"As for the antidote," Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head and smiled sweetly, her red eyes seeming to glow. "As long as you do as I say, I'll give it to you!" [[877 池小橙 happy]]
With that, she shook her phone again. "I need you to stay by Su Tao's side at all times and report everything she does to me. I'll add you on WeChat with a burner account later." [[878 池小橙 neutral]]
"And don't even think about resisting." [[879 池小橙 angry]]
"You don't want your face to rot and have everyone in school find out about the ugly things you've done, do you?" [[880 池小橙 angry]]
Watching Chi Xiaocheng turn to leave, Chen Qian's fear grew deeper. [[881 旁白 neutral]]
This person was a devil! [[882 旁白 sad]]
She frantically started to clean up the evidence of her crime, but then something occurred to her, and she scrambled toward the door. [[883 旁白 neutral]]
"The hospital, I have to go to the hospital..." [[884 陈倩 sad]]
But as soon as she opened the door, she froze. [[885 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was leaning against the hallway railing. The breeze lifted her hair as she slowly glanced sideways, her calm gaze seeming to say, 'Going to the hospital won't help.' [[886 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling all her strength leave her, Chen Qian quickly grabbed the railing for support. [[887 旁白 sad]]
She followed Chi Xiaocheng's gaze toward the front of the dormitory building. [[888 旁白 neutral]]
A beautiful, delicate-featured girl was slowly walking toward their building. [[889 旁白 neutral]]
It was Su Tao. [[890 旁白 neutral]]
She was back so soon? [[891 旁白 sad]]
Stunned, Chen Qian turned to look back at Chi Xiaocheng. [[892 旁白 sad]]
She saw the petite girl staring intently at Su Tao, her enchanting red eyes looking at her as if she were prey. [[893 旁白 neutral]]
