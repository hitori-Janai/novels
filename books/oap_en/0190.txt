Chapter 190: A Day Without Xiaocheng [[16592 旁白 neutral]]
Early in the morning, despite the sub-zero temperature, Su Tao washed her face with a little cold water. [[16593 旁白 neutral]]
After feeling the biting cold, she felt much more awake. [[16594 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she walked into another storage room, where there were unopened boxes. [[16595 旁白 neutral]]
There were health supplements from Dongfang Yang, who was worried about her physical condition. [[16596 旁白 neutral]]
There were also various skincare products from Si Chen, who was worried she was neglecting herself. [[16597 旁白 neutral]]
And also the "very nutritious" instant noodles that Chi Xiaocheng had mysteriously told her about a long time ago. [[16598 旁白 neutral]]
During her days of being withdrawn, Su Tao hadn't touched any of these things. [[16599 旁白 sad]]
Now that she had to live a good life for Xiaocheng's sake, she couldn't go on like before. [[16600 苏桃 neutral]]
The skincare products and supplements, sent by these two young masters, were sure to be high quality and probably cost a fortune. [[16601 旁白 neutral]]
This box of instant noodles… [[16602 苏桃 neutral]]
Her rational mind told her that she was in poor health and shouldn't eat instant noodles; she needed something more nutritious. [[16603 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao remembered the pill Chi Xiaocheng had given her last time. [[16604 旁白 neutral]]
She had said that since she looked unwell, the pill would help her sleep well, reduce stress, and regain her energy. [[16605 池小橙 neutral]]
At that time, she didn't believe her and didn't dare to. [[16606 旁白 sad]]
She was afraid that, just like before, she would be unable to resist after taking the pill. [[16607 旁白 sad]]
It was only after she took it in a moment of despair that she realized the pill was real. [[16608 旁白 sad]]
That was the wrong choice. [[16609 旁白 sad]]
If she had chosen to believe Xiaocheng then, she would have recovered her energy the next day and wouldn't have lost her temper and argued with her. [[16610 旁白 sad]]
She wouldn't have pushed her to the balcony window. [[16611 旁白 sad]]
And the death that followed would not have happened. [[16612 旁白 sad]]
"Very nutritious instant noodles. I remember Xiaocheng also said they would be even better with the eggs she left in the fridge." [[16613 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao opened the fridge and took out an egg. [[16614 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll have this for breakfast, and a glass of warm milk." [[16615 苏桃 neutral]]
"Although the snow has stopped, I'm not in good shape to write. My body has become sluggish. I'll go to Dongfang Yang's hospital to get a check-up first, and then..." [[16616 苏桃 neutral]]
As Su Tao spoke, her hand, which was mixing the milk, paused. [[16617 旁白 neutral]]
She whispered the word that she cared about again, "Hospital..." [[16618 苏桃 sad]]
I wonder how Xiaocheng's body is doing now. [[16619 苏桃 sad]]
Fang Ning also went to the hospital last night. [[16620 旁白 neutral]]
Her mood suddenly dropped. [[16621 旁白 sad]]
Then Su Tao took a deep breath and patted her cheeks, "Leave the regrets for bedtime and the pain for dreams. It's time to look forward." [[16622 苏桃 neutral]]
She ate breakfast, gave Da Wang a bath, and tidied up the blankets Chi Xiaocheng had laid on the floor, giving the house a major cleaning before the New Year. [[16623 旁白 neutral]]
After being busy until noon, she went out to buy groceries and cook. [[16624 旁白 neutral]]
In the afternoon, she went to the university. She had failed four subjects in total from her final exams, including required and elective courses. [[16625 旁白 neutral]]
These were all courses she had to retake next semester. [[16626 旁白 neutral]]
It would be very tiring. [[16627 旁白 neutral]]
But she couldn't blame Xiaocheng; it was her own fault. [[16628 旁白 sad]]
After packing up Chi Xiaocheng's things from her dorm, she went to her own. [[16629 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian had already gone home, leaving only Xiao Wei asleep in her bed. [[16630 旁白 neutral]]
She continued to pack her own things to go home for the holiday. The noise she made inevitably woke Xiao Wei up. [[16631 旁白 neutral]]
The girl with the round face yawned and rubbed her sleepy eyes, "Oh, it's Taozi. Are you leaving too?" [[16632 小唯 neutral]]
Su Tao gave Xiao Wei an apologetic smile, "You can go back to sleep. I'll clean the dorm after I finish packing. You can just take your things and go whenever you're ready. Sorry for the trouble during this time." [[16633 苏桃 neutral]]
Xiao Wei giggled, "No need to clean so much, Chen Qian already swept before she left. But why do you have so much luggage?" [[16634 小唯 neutral]]
"Some of it belongs to Xiaocheng. I'm taking it back for her." [[16635 苏桃 sad]]
Xiao Wei blinked, "Oh, I remember now. You said last time that Xiaocheng went back to her hometown early." [[16636 小唯 neutral]]
Su Tao's packing movements paused for a moment. [[16637 旁白 neutral]]
She no longer avoided the question with a low spirit like before. [[16638 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she put on a bright smile, "Yes, she even chatted with me last night." [[16639 苏桃 happy]]
Face this reality. [[16640 旁白 neutral]]
No longer run away from Xiaocheng's death. [[16641 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what, she would always live in her heart. [[16642 苏桃 neutral]]
After packing her things and saying goodbye to Xiao Wei, Su Tao also made a quick visit to her new advisor. [[16643 旁白 neutral]]
Her old advisor had been arrested for academic plagiarism. Under her new advisor, she also managed to get her previously plagiarized paper certified. [[16644 旁白 neutral]]
Then she went home. [[16645 旁白 neutral]]
Although she maintained a positive attitude, the sadness in her heart couldn't be easily erased. [[16646 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao just didn't show it on her face. Occasionally, while doing something, she would zone out for a while. [[16647 旁白 sad]]
Imagining what it would be like if Xiaocheng were by her side. [[16648 旁白 sad]]
But that was just a wish. [[16649 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao didn't disturb Chi Xiaocheng's room; she wanted to keep it as she remembered, but she had packed away most of her belongings. [[16650 旁白 sad]]
Hairpins, handkerchiefs, many small trinkets she liked, and the fruit knife she would never forget. [[16651 旁白 sad]]
As evening approached, Su Tao went out wearing a down jacket. [[16652 旁白 neutral]]
When she reached the entrance of her residential complex, a red sports car was already waiting for her. The man leaning against the driver's seat flicked his bangs and raised an eyebrow at Su Tao, "Get in. This is the first time you've called me not asking for help." [[16653 东方阳 happy]]
Dongfang Yang seemed to be in good spirits, but it was also clear that he was observing Su Tao. [[16654 旁白 neutral]]
He was paying attention to her energy and emotions. [[16655 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao's familiar smile, he finally relaxed, "It seems you're much better. Honestly, if you didn't show any improvement, I was about to ask Dr. Chen to see you." [[16656 东方阳 happy]]
Su Tao naturally sat in the passenger seat and joked, "Dr. Chen specializes in Xiaocheng's area. Isn't it inappropriate for him to see me?" [[16657 苏桃 happy]]
After all, I'm not a yandere. [[16658 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang started the car and stepped on the gas, "Dr. Chen knows a lot of things, not just about schizophrenia like Chi Xiaocheng's case. But seeing how you are now, there's no need to call him over." [[16659 东方阳 happy]]
Su Tao leaned back in the passenger seat, her eyes looking distant, "I dreamt of Xiaocheng last night. Although it was just a dream and she can't come back, I still talked with her for a long, long time." [[16660 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang glanced at Su Tao, "So you've come to terms with it now?" [[16661 东方阳 neutral]]
"Yes!" [[16662 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao nodded seriously, "She saved me. If I continue to be this down, it would only disappoint her." [[16663 苏桃 happy]]
"I've been avoiding it for a month, it's time to face it." [[16664 苏桃 neutral]]
She once again radiated the same resilient spirit as before. [[16665 旁白 happy]]
Dongfang Yang's lips curved up when he heard this, "So, are we going to the hospital now?" [[16666 东方阳 happy]]
Su Tao nodded firmly, "Is Xiaocheng still at the hospital? If so, let's go. I want to... see her one last time." [[16667 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang sped up a little, a smile on his face, "Don't worry, she's been at the hospital all this time. And... I have some good news for you." [[16668 东方阳 happy]]
"Good news?" [[16669 苏桃 neutral]]
In her current situation, what news could possibly be good for her? [[16670 苏桃 neutral]]
But Dongfang Yang didn't look like he was lying; he looked serious and expectant, "Anyway, you'll know when we get to the hospital." [[16671 东方阳 happy]]
