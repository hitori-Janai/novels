Chapter 101: Memories of the Past [[8721 旁白 neutral]]
After chatting with Brother Long for a while with her sweet-little-sister persona, Chi Xiaocheng hung up and returned to her room. [[8722 旁白 neutral]]
She had two things to do now. [[8723 旁白 neutral]]
First, deal with the poisoned apple in the System's space. When Ye Liang woke up and could eat again, she thought she could find a chance to give the apple to him. [[8724 旁白 neutral]]
Second, give the figurine she got from the gacha to Su Tao. [[8725 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng locked the door and took the figurine out of the System's space. [[8726 旁白 neutral]]
It was a figurine of two people, exquisitely made and lifelike. [[8727 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, with long gray hair, wore a dark fairytale-style black dress and elegant high heels, looking as if she were dancing with Chi Xiaocheng. [[8728 旁白 neutral]]
Her body leaned slightly forward, her right hand around the waist of the figure in white. Her left index finger touched Chi Xiaocheng's chin, tilting it up slightly. A strange smile played on her lips, her gaze aggressively fixed on the person in her arms. [[8729 旁白 neutral]]
And Chi Xiaocheng, in a contrasting white princess dress, was in a pose as if she was about to fall but was caught. Her feet barely touched the ground, her eyes were a little teary, and her expression was worried and scared, like a fragile little white rabbit. [[8730 旁白 neutral]]
Including the base, the figurine was less than 20 centimeters tall. It seemed as if their height difference had been scaled down at a 1:10 ratio. [[8731 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was 1.53 meters tall, and her figurine was 15.3 centimeters. [[8732 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was 1.66 meters tall, and her figurine was 16.6 centimeters. [[8733 旁白 neutral]]
Like an angel and a demon embracing, or a big gray wolf and a little white rabbit, and it was the complete opposite of their real-life situation. [[8734 旁白 neutral]]
In the figurine's roles, Su Tao was the dark one, while Chi Xiaocheng was timid and cute, ready to be picked. [[8735 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng held the figurine up high with both hands. [[8736 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's character had a cartoon orange pattern. [[8737 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's character had a cartoon peach pattern. [[8738 旁白 neutral]]
The details and textures were incredibly fine. [[8739 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a masterpiece!" [[8740 池小橙 happy]]
"The System's description said that staring at it for a long time would cause a daze. Just its lifelike quality and the stunning impact of the clothing's color combination are amazing enough." [[8741 池小橙 neutral]]
"A lucid dream... what kind of dream would that be?" [[8742 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought for a moment and decided to try it herself before giving it to Su Tao. [[8743 旁白 neutral]]
Just like with the muscle-relaxing powder and sleeping tea from the dark room last time, Chi Xiaocheng tested it first to make sure she could handle the situation better before using it on Su Tao. [[8744 旁白 neutral]]
After changing into her pajamas, Chi Xiaocheng got into a sleeping position and placed the figurine on the bedside table, staring at it quietly. [[8745 旁白 neutral]]
The chaotic thoughts in her mind seemed to gradually disappear. [[8746 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng even felt her thinking slow down. [[8747 旁白 neutral]]
In her vision, the two figures in the figurine seemed to come to life. [[8748 旁白 neutral]]
The Su Tao in the black dress tapped her finger, and in the next moment, a terrifying smile appeared on her face. [[8749 旁白 neutral]]
A red moon seemed to appear in the surroundings. [[8750 旁白 neutral]]
The girl's eyes suddenly glowed red. [[8751 旁白 neutral]]
And the originally delicate and fearful Xiaocheng's expression instantly turned into one of sick enjoyment and pleasure. [[8752 旁白 neutral]]
This horrifying scene almost scared the soul out of Chi Xiaocheng. [[8753 旁白 neutral]]
She swallowed and shook her head, "That's a bit scary. Am I going to have a dream like that tonight?" [[8754 池小橙 sad]]
But if a scene like that really happened, it might not be so bad? [[8755 旁白 neutral]]
After the daze, she began to feel sleepy. [[8756 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't resist. She wanted to try what a lucid dream was like, so she closed her eyes and hugged a new large brown teddy bear pillow she had bought. [[8757 旁白 neutral]]
Hmm? [[8758 旁白 neutral]]
What about the old panda pillow, you ask? [[8759 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed that as the weather got colder, the panda expanded and contracted with the heat, causing the fabric to tear open in various places. The threads on its arms and legs snapped, and the cotton inside spilled out. [[8760 旁白 neutral]]
The manufacturer's quality was too poor, so it broke. [[8761 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had no choice but to get a new one. [[8762 旁白 neutral]]
Her consciousness gradually faded, her thoughts stopped, and Chi Xiaocheng fell into a deep sleep before she could even turn off the light. [[8763 旁白 neutral]]
Time seemed to pass for a long while, or maybe just an instant. When Chi Xiaocheng opened her eyes again, she felt she was in an unusually familiar place. [[8764 旁白 neutral]]
Across the street from the Flinton Grand Hotel. [[8765 旁白 neutral]]
This place was more than familiar; she would never forget it in her life. [[8766 旁白 neutral]]
It was the beginning of the end of her relationship with her girlfriend in her past life. [[8767 旁白 neutral]]
"Did I travel back in time?" [[8768 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng shivered and suddenly turned around to find a blurry figure standing beside her. [[8769 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't see the face or the body clearly. It was like a little black figure from Conan, or a distorted shadow from a ghost movie. [[8770 旁白 neutral]]
This person was holding a beautiful bouquet of 52 white roses. Even though she couldn't see the face, Chi Xiaocheng knew the expression was one of anticipation, joy, and happiness. [[8771 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at her own hands. [[8772 旁白 neutral]]
"Transparent..." [[8773 池小橙 neutral]]
Her eyes flickered. "I didn't travel back. The me from my past life is already dead. I almost forgot this is a lucid dream." [[8774 池小橙 neutral]]
Right now, she was less like a person and more like a blurry spirit. [[8775 旁白 neutral]]
And the person next to her holding the pure white roses was herself from her past life! [[8776 旁白 neutral]]
"To think I'd have a dream like this. Do I still have attachments to my past life?" [[8777 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had thought the dream would be the scene she had hallucinated from the figurine. [[8778 旁白 neutral]]
Who would have thought it would be a memory of the past. [[8779 旁白 neutral]]
However, it was impossible for her to have any lingering feelings for her past self. [[8780 旁白 neutral]]
She clearly remembered the plot that was about to unfold. [[8781 旁白 neutral]]
On the second anniversary of her relationship with her girlfriend, she had eagerly bought roses and a gift, but after crossing the 90-second traffic light, she saw her girlfriend walking out of the hotel with a middle-aged man. [[8782 旁白 neutral]]
It turned out her girlfriend had already betrayed her. [[8783 旁白 neutral]]
Her past self's heart was torn with pain. After realizing she had been betrayed, she broke up with her girlfriend. [[8784 旁白 neutral]]
And then. [[8785 旁白 neutral]]
"Hiss..." [[8786 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng clutched her head, which was aching, unwilling to recall the memory. [[8787 旁白 neutral]]
She only remembered being at home, moping for three months before going out. [[8788 旁白 neutral]]
She encountered a criminal at a cafe, was hospitalized after fighting him off, and upon discharge, was sent by a large truck into the world of this female-oriented novel. [[8789 旁白 neutral]]
After transmigrating, she made it her goal to use Su Tao's protagonist halo for self-preservation, and found pleasure in teasing Su Tao, which led her to the present. [[8790 旁白 neutral]]
The past had long been left behind. [[8791 旁白 neutral]]
And this dream had brought her back! [[8792 旁白 neutral]]
"What's the point of watching something that already happened all over again?" [[8793 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng spoke to her former self. [[8794 旁白 neutral]]
However, just as she expected, her former self couldn't hear her. [[8795 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out to touch the roses. [[8796 旁白 neutral]]
Her hand just passed through them. [[8797 旁白 neutral]]
In that moment, she understood her role in this dream. [[8798 旁白 neutral]]
A spectator. [[8799 旁白 neutral]]
Unable to influence the dream's direction, nor a part of it, as if peeking into an unforgettable memory of the past. [[8800 旁白 neutral]]
The red light at the crosswalk ticked down, second by second. The evening dusk felt especially heavy. [[8801 旁白 neutral]]
The blurry figure holding the white roses grew more expectant, while Chi Xiaocheng's own heart sank. [[8802 旁白 neutral]]
The red light stopped, the yellow light flashed, and the green light turned on. [[8803 旁白 neutral]]
The world seemed to freeze at that moment, along with the traffic. [[8804 旁白 neutral]]
Her former self, holding the roses, was the first to step forward. [[8805 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed and followed closely behind. [[8806 旁白 neutral]]
As she walked, the people around her seemed to gradually fade away. The crosswalk turned into a bridge, and the surrounding traffic flowed like rushing blood. [[8807 旁白 neutral]]
When she reached the other side, the bustling street was empty in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. [[8808 旁白 neutral]]
A man with a gold chain had his arm around her former girlfriend, slowly walking out of the hotel. [[8809 旁白 neutral]]
