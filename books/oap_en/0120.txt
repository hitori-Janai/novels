Chapter 120: What Do You Really Care About! [[10599 旁白 neutral]]
Stepping into the hotel, Dongfang Yang walked ahead of Su Tao, rarely showing such an arrogant and imposing expression in public. [[10600 旁白 neutral]]
He had learned about Su Tao's father and the marriage contract three days ago. [[10601 旁白 neutral]]
But this was the first time he had met Xiao Ming in person. [[10602 旁白 neutral]]
It was impossible for him to feel nothing about it. [[10603 旁白 angry]]
Even setting aside his own small feelings for Su Tao, just as a friend, he couldn't stand this person who had appeared out of nowhere to threaten her. [[10604 旁白 angry]]
Inside the elevator, Dongfang Yang looked at Su Tao, who was still visibly upset, and said forcefully, "In a moment, tell Xiao Ming clearly that you don't want to marry him. Ask him where your father is. I'm here to support you, so be strong, understand?" [[10605 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao flinched slightly and didn't answer. [[10606 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang clicked his tongue in annoyance but didn't push her any further. [[10607 旁白 neutral]]
The elevator stopped on the 15th floor. [[10608 旁白 neutral]]
When the doors opened, two intimidating men in black were standing right outside. [[10609 旁白 neutral]]
Not backing down, Dongfang Yang walked past them with his two bodyguards. [[10610 旁白 neutral]]
Entering the lobby, Dongfang Yang saw a man with a roguish air, dressed in a worn-out jacket. He was sitting on a sofa, idly playing with a few cards. [[10611 旁白 neutral]]
This was a sharp contrast to Dongfang Yang's own flashy, red mink coat. [[10612 旁白 neutral]]
The worn-out marriage contract was lying on the table in front of him. [[10613 旁白 neutral]]
When he saw Su Tao enter the lobby, Xiao Ming's eyes lit up. [[10614 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had a long day. She had a near-death experience, came from the police station, and then rushed here because of a text from Xiao Ming. [[10615 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't had much time to freshen up. She had only quickly treated the wound on her forehead and tied up her hair. [[10616 旁白 neutral]]
Her woolen coat was dusty in several places. [[10617 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, with her tired but determined expression, Su Tao still looked incredibly cool and charming. [[10618 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang frowned and stepped in front of Su Tao. "You're Xiao Ming?" [[10619 东方阳 neutral]]
Xiao Ming raised an eyebrow. "And who are you?" [[10620 萧鸣 neutral]]
"Dongfang Yang." [[10621 东方阳 neutral]]
"Oh, so you're the young master of the Dongfang family. This is between Su Tao and me. What's an outsider like you getting involved for?" [[10622 萧鸣 angry]]
Su Tao pulled on Dongfang Yang's sleeve, signaling him not to be rash. She turned to Xiao Ming and said directly, "Last time, you said you knew my father, and in your text, you said you could give me information about him, right?" [[10623 苏桃 neutral]]
"Of course," Xiao Ming said with a grin. "You're my fiancée, after all. I came back from abroad at the request of my father-in-law to find you and protect you." [[10624 萧鸣 neutral]]
Su Tao frowned. "You're not getting to the point." [[10625 苏桃 angry]]
Just after getting out of the elevator, she had sent two more messages to Chi Xiaocheng and even nudged her. [[10626 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng still hadn't replied, which made her anxious. [[10627 旁白 sad]]
The feeling of unease in her heart grew stronger. [[10628 旁白 neutral]]
However, Xiao Ming seemed in no hurry at all. "I do have the information you need, Miss Su, but I called you here today mainly to talk more about our marriage contract." [[10629 萧鸣 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang immediately cut in, "What's there to talk about? Of course Su Tao doesn't want to. Who do you think you are, trying to marry Su Tao with just a piece of paper?" [[10630 东方阳 angry]]
Xiao Ming retorted sarcastically, "Is the famous Young Master Dongfang a simp, too? This is my family's business, what does it have to do with you? As a child of a great family, don't you know the importance of a contract?" [[10631 萧鸣 angry]]
"Moreover!" [[10632 萧鸣 angry]]
Xiao Ming stood up and slapped his hand on the marriage contract. "This was arranged by Su Tao's grandfather! Miss Su and I have a childhood engagement!" [[10633 萧鸣 angry]]
Su Tao took a breath. She had already seen the marriage contract. [[10634 旁白 neutral]]
She had also checked it against the jade pendant that had always brought her luck; they were indeed a set. [[10635 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Ming snorted. "Miss Su, it's your turn to speak. Do you want to leave, or sit down and talk?" [[10636 萧鸣 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang also said from the side, "Su Tao, don't listen to him!" [[10637 东方阳 angry]]
Su Tao bit her lip and finally said to Dongfang Yang, "Dongfang Yang, let's hear what Xiao Ming has to say first. After all, that's... my father." [[10638 苏桃 sad]]
She hesitated again. [[10639 旁白 neutral]]
Being an orphan since she was young, it was her longing for a family that made her cherish her childhood memories with Chi Xiaocheng so much. [[10640 旁白 sad]]
At night, holding the jade pendant, she would sometimes dream that her family had found her somewhere. [[10641 旁白 sad]]
Living alone was, after all, too lonely. [[10642 旁白 sad]]
"You know, Su Tao," Dongfang Yang said with a frustrated laugh, "I've told you before, I actually have feelings for you." [[10643 东方阳 sad]]
Su Tao looked at Dongfang Yang, stunned, not understanding why he would say that now. [[10644 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang said bluntly, "The you I knew back then was outstanding, decisive, and confident. You could stay calm and rational in any situation, and you wouldn't bow to money. You had this firm belief of 'I am who I am,' which influenced everyone around you like moonlight." [[10645 东方阳 sad]]
"So back then, I, Ye Liang, and Si Chen all made a rule not to use extreme methods to force you. If we liked you, we would pursue you with our own abilities." [[10646 东方阳 sad]]
"But now, Ye Liang crossed the line, and he got what he deserved." [[10647 东方阳 angry]]
"You asked me for help this time instead of Si Chen, so you must have felt him pulling away from you." [[10648 东方阳 sad]]
"Even I feel like you've changed." [[10649 东方阳 sad]]
Dongfang Yang slammed his hand on the marriage contract, his tone full of disappointment. "You're worried about Chi Xiaocheng, afraid she'll do something foolish at home alone because you two fought!" [[10650 东方阳 angry]]
"But what are you doing right now?" [[10651 东方阳 angry]]
"A father who hasn't cared about you for 19 years." [[10652 东方阳 angry]]
"A fiancé who appeared out of nowhere and looks like a street punk." [[10653 东方阳 angry]]
"And you're still hesitating over whether they're more important than Chi Xiaocheng?" [[10654 东方阳 angry]]
"What are you trying to run away from!" [[10655 东方阳 angry]]
Dongfang Yang's voice was practically a roar at Su Tao. [[10656 旁白 angry]]
He really couldn't stand it anymore. [[10657 旁白 angry]]
Not Su Tao, and not this pretentious Xiao Ming. [[10658 旁白 angry]]
Xiao Ming looked at Dongfang Yang coldly. "That's Su Tao's biological father, what do you mean by saying that!" [[10659 萧鸣 angry]]
"Biological father?" Dongfang Yang scoffed, looking at Su Tao with indifference. "I don't think he cares about you more than that hopelessly stupid Chi Xiaocheng does." [[10660 东方阳 angry]]
"Or are you saying you don't care about Chi Xiaocheng at all?" [[10661 东方阳 angry]]
Dongfang Yang's words struck Su Tao's heart like a great bell. [[10662 旁白 neutral]]
What am I running from? [[10663 苏桃 sad]]
Are the marriage contract and my father really more important than Xiaocheng? [[10664 苏桃 sad]]
The memory of her phone messages flashed in her mind, and the bright red rain from the rooftop that day seemed to be dripping just outside the window. [[10665 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao clenched her fists, shouting out all the anxiety that had built up all night, "Of course I care more about Xiaocheng!" [[10666 苏桃 angry]]
"Then what the hell are you still doing here!" Dongfang Yang yelled. "If you know she's going to do something stupid, and you care about her, then go watch over her!" [[10667 东方阳 angry]]
With that, he reached out and snatched the marriage contract from the table. [[10668 旁白 neutral]]
"In the end, it's just a piece of paper meant to confuse people." [[10669 东方阳 angry]]
A bad feeling rose in Xiao Ming's heart. "Hey, what do you think you're doing!" [[10670 萧鸣 angry]]
He reached out to grab it back, but Dongfang Yang had no patience for this guy who had annoyed him from the start. [[10671 旁白 neutral]]
"Who do you think you are!" [[10672 东方阳 angry]]
He swung out a long leg with a dull "thud," sending Xiao Ming flying! [[10673 旁白 neutral]]
And then. [[10674 旁白 neutral]]
"Rip—Rip—" [[10675 旁白 neutral]]
The marriage contract was torn to shreds. [[10676 旁白 neutral]]
It also cleared the fog from Su Tao's eyes. [[10677 旁白 neutral]]
