Chapter 193: Another Suicide Note [[16897 旁白 neutral]]
At night, after a busy day, Su Tao returned home. [[16898 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since she learned that the Xiaocheng she missed so much might wake up, Su Tao felt like her whole world was filled with light. [[16899 旁白 happy]]
Even though the chance of her waking up was very small. [[16900 旁白 neutral]]
But at least, in her dark and hopeless world, a little bit of light had finally appeared. [[16901 旁白 happy]]
This little bit of light was everything in her dark world. [[16902 旁白 neutral]]
She went to bed early and woke up early, returning to her daily health routine. She wasn't sure if it was the nutritionist's changes or the magical instant noodles, but Su Tao could clearly feel her body recovering day by day. [[16903 旁白 neutral]]
Then she started exercising, managing her figure, and taking care of her skin. She quit her job at the snack supermarket and went to work at Dongfang Yang's cafe. [[16904 旁白 neutral]]
Although she went to work at the cafe, Su Tao also told Dongfang Yang that she didn't want to just rely on him and waste her life away. [[16905 苏桃 neutral]]
She understood why he let Chi Xiaocheng work there. Xiaocheng was in poor health and had been targeted by Ye Liang before. Working there was, one, to protect her, and two, to give her a reason to "pay him back" so she wouldn't feel too guilty. [[16906 旁白 neutral]]
But she, Su Tao, was different. [[16907 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't like Dongfang Yang in a romantic way and had always seen him as a friend, or even an older brother figure. [[16908 旁白 neutral]]
And in the future, she wanted to be with Xiaocheng. [[16909 旁白 neutral]]
So she couldn't just get by like before. [[16910 旁白 neutral]]
She had to work hard enough to support their home! [[16911 旁白 neutral]]
After arguing with Dongfang Yang for a long time, she finally accepted the following conditions. [[16912 旁白 neutral]]
A base salary of 3,500, and she would become the manager of the entire cafe. From then on, all of the cafe's operations and management would be up to her. [[16913 旁白 neutral]]
If the cafe made a profit that month, she would get a 25% commission as a bonus. [[16914 旁白 neutral]]
If it lost money, then nothing would happen. [[16915 旁白 neutral]]
And Chu San would be her assistant, following her orders. [[16916 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, Dongfang Yang still intended to support Su Tao. Even if Su Tao did nothing but clock in every day, he would still pay her the 3,500 salary. [[16917 旁白 neutral]]
But the girl's pride and stubbornness meant she was destined to take it seriously. [[16918 旁白 neutral]]
However, as a high-end cafe, it was definitely losing money every month. Su Tao's goal was to bring the cafe back to life. [[16919 旁白 neutral]]
At least, while working and improving herself, she wouldn't be too far from Xiaocheng at the cafe in the future. [[16920 旁白 neutral]]
Even while working, she could still take care of her. [[16921 旁白 neutral]]
It was just that her knowledge of how to manage and run a shop was almost zero. [[16922 旁白 neutral]]
Spending a day re-learning things left Su Tao feeling both fulfilled and exhausted. [[16923 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as she entered, she saw Da Wang playing with the scarecrow doll again. [[16924 旁白 neutral]]
There were quite a few dolls in the corner of the room. [[16925 旁白 neutral]]
But Da Wang was particularly fond of this scarecrow doll. [[16926 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao often found the little thing tossed around in various corners by Da Wang. [[16927 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao, Da Wang happily ran over with "Chi Xiaocheng" in its mouth. [[16928 旁白 neutral]]
The scarecrow tumbled in the air, already used to being thrown around by this darn cat. Each time it was thrown, Da Wang's future treatment secretly dropped a little. [[16929 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao changed her shoes, crouched down, and helplessly scratched Da Wang's chin. "You really like this doll, don't you? Is it because its eyes are red, just like Xiaocheng's?" [[16930 苏桃 neutral]]
Da Wang put down the scarecrow and nodded with a "meow." [[16931 旁白 neutral]]
It was unclear if it was enjoying Su Tao's touch or agreeing with what she said. [[16932 旁白 neutral]]
The girl picked up the scarecrow that was Chi Xiaocheng from the floor, staring at its crimson vertical pupils. [[16933 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, she really felt that this scarecrow was the person she longed for. [[16934 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao gave a bitter smile. "I guess I'm just thinking about Xiaocheng too much." [[16935 苏桃 sad]]
She said as she stood up, "But I don't remember buying this with Xiaocheng. Did she buy it herself? And when?" [[16936 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't think much about it. After resting for a while, she cooked and ate dinner. [[16937 旁白 neutral]]
After taking a shower, she went to the hospital. [[16938 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know when Xiaocheng would wake up. [[16939 旁白 neutral]]
But she remembered something Chi Xiaocheng once said. [[16940 旁白 neutral]]
"It makes me so happy that Taotao is by my side every time I wake up." [[16941 池小橙 happy]]
She wants to see me when she wakes up. [[16942 苏桃 neutral]]
If I have time, I should stay with her at the hospital more. [[16943 苏桃 neutral]]
When she returned at 11 o'clock, Su Tao saw the scarecrow had been heartlessly tossed at the door by Da Wang again. [[16944 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao smiled helplessly and picked up the scarecrow. [[16945 旁白 neutral]]
A strange sense of peace was transmitted to her. [[16946 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao met the doll's crimson eyes again and couldn't help but whisper, "It's so magical, it's like Xiaocheng is right here with me." [[16947 苏桃 happy]]
Placing the scarecrow back on the desk in her room, Su Tao didn't notice the doll's sly little smile. [[16948 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, just as she was about to lie down, she noticed her mattress had been scratched a little at some point. [[16949 旁白 neutral]]
Without a doubt, she knew Da Wang had done it. [[16950 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm? Why is there paper here?" [[16951 苏桃 neutral]]
Just as Su Tao was about to fix the mattress, she found a wrinkled piece of paper tucked underneath it. [[16952 旁白 neutral]]
After pulling out the paper with some effort, Su Tao froze on the spot. [[16953 旁白 neutral]]
To my Taotao. [[16954 池小橙 neutral]]
The three large words on top were already dusty. The paper quality was average, so it must have been pressed here for at least a month. [[16955 旁白 neutral]]
For some reason, a bad feeling rose in Su Tao's heart. [[16956 旁白 sad]]
She continued reading the paper. [[16957 旁白 neutral]]
When you see this letter, I should already be dead. I'm so sorry for always causing you so much trouble. [[16958 池小橙 sad]]
As for words of parting, I actually wrote most of them in the suicide note, but I still feel like there's more I wanted to say. [[16959 池小橙 sad]]
I want Taotao to forget me in the end and start a new life. [[16960 池小橙 sad]]
That way, you won't have to worry or struggle over me anymore. [[16961 池小橙 sad]]
But in the end, I really don't want Taotao to forget me. From the moment I met you as a child, I have never had any regrets. [[16962 池小橙 happy]]
But when I think about all the trouble I've caused you, I wonder if you would have had a better life if we had never met. [[16963 池小橙 sad]]
After all, you are so amazing. [[16964 池小橙 happy]]
And I am so clumsy. [[16965 池小橙 sad]]
It seems useless to say all this now, it will only cause you more trouble, haha. [[16966 池小橙 sad]]
I'm sorry. [[16967 池小橙 sad]]
However, I do have a little selfish wish. [[16968 池小橙 neutral]]
I still hope I can stay by Taotao's side. [[16969 池小橙 happy]]
So I secretly made a little doll. That's right, it's a little orange scarecrow! I secretly put it under the pile of dolls! [[16970 池小橙 happy]]
If you find it one day, please don't throw it away. [[16971 池小橙 sad]]
I don't need you to remember me, as long as I can stay by your side in another form. [[16972 池小橙 neutral]]
You always said I could bring you good luck. [[16973 池小橙 happy]]
I'm gone, but I don't want to take that luck with me. [[16974 池小橙 sad]]
So, just let this little doll stay by your side. [[16975 池小橙 neutral]]
Also, I'll hide this paper secretly. If you can't find it, then please forget me. [[16976 池小橙 sad]]
If you find it, think of me once in a while, okay? [[16977 池小橙 happy]]
I hope you live a happy life from now on. [[16978 池小橙 happy]]
With love, your Xiaocheng who will always be yours. [[16979 池小橙 happy]]
Tears fell, drop by drop, onto the paper. [[16980 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's eyes had turned red before she knew it. [[16981 旁白 sad]]
Her somewhat blurry vision turned to the small doll on the desk. [[16982 旁白 sad]]
The little doll was looking at her obediently. Even though it was a doll, its lips seemed to curve into a doting and fond smile. [[16983 旁白 happy]]
No wonder this little doll's eyes looked so much like Xiaocheng's. [[16984 旁白 happy]]
No wonder it also had a dried orange slice as an accessory on its head. [[16985 旁白 happy]]
No wonder holding it gave her a sense of peace. [[16986 旁白 happy]]
So, this was where she had placed all her hopes. [[16987 旁白 happy]]
My lovely Xiaocheng. [[16988 苏桃 happy]]
