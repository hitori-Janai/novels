Chapter 50 Her Time Can Only Be Hers (Bonus Chapter) [[4327 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao needed three days of rest, so naturally, she couldn't let the outside world discover anything amiss. [[4328 旁白 neutral]]
These pre-arranged six hours were Chi Xiaocheng's preparation time. [[4329 旁白 neutral]]
Only after she was fully prepared could she properly cherish her Tao Tao without any disturbances. [[4330 旁白 neutral]]
Otherwise, if discovered, her fate would be miserable. [[4331 旁白 neutral]]
Take one step, look three steps ahead. [[4332 旁白 neutral]]
Not fighting battles she wasn't confident in, this was Chi Xiaocheng's consistent way of doing things. [[4333 旁白 neutral]]
Although playing a yandere, the final outcome of faking death in front of Su Tao was also good, but given the current level of affection, even if she died, Su Tao wouldn't be heartbroken. [[4334 旁白 neutral]]
This death would not become an eternal pain in her heart. [[4335 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking this, Chi Xiaocheng picked up Su Tao's phone. [[4336 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the phone, she found that many people had sent her messages. [[4337 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm... as for the phone password..." [[4338 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at Su Tao's fingers, guessed, and entered six digits. [[4339 旁白 neutral]]
031225. [[4340 旁白 neutral]]
The phone screen paused. [[4341 旁白 neutral]]
Unlock successful! [[4342 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the password was correct, Chi Xiaocheng's gaze towards Su Tao became even more eager. [[4343 旁白 neutral]]
"The password is actually my birthday. Tao Tao, Tao Tao, how can I ignore you like this?" [[4344 池小橙 happy]]
With the phone unlocked, Chi Xiaocheng looked at the WeChat messages. [[4345 旁白 neutral]]
There were three people at the top. [[4346 旁白 neutral]]
The first, Xiaocheng. [[4347 旁白 neutral]]
The second, Doctor Cheng. [[4348 旁白 neutral]]
The third, Ye Liang! [[4349 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stared intently at the third name, her eyes growing colder. [[4350 旁白 neutral]]
Then she turned to look at Su Tao, her eyes filled with resentment. [[4351 旁白 neutral]]
None of the top contacts were herself. It seems Tao Tao still needs some training. [[4352 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at her phone again and found that many messages were just meaningless chats. Several frequently chatted names were probably other friends. [[4353 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng secretly memorized these names, then paid attention to some important information. [[4354 旁白 neutral]]
First, Si Chen. He sent seven or eight messages to Su Tao, all telling her not to come to him to test if she was a yandere. [[4355 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed Si Chen was scared by her and firmly believed that she was a yandere. [[4356 旁白 neutral]]
But these messages... [[4357 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't like them. [[4358 旁白 neutral]]
Since you're on my side, why aren't you persuading Su Tao to come over? [[4359 旁白 neutral]]
What she said last time was all empty talk! [[4360 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng typed a reply using Su Tao's phone, "I'm fine, don't worry." [[4361 池小橙 neutral]]
"Okay, done." [[4362 旁白 neutral]]
Without waiting for Si Chen's reply, Chi Xiaocheng repeated the process, replying to other people who greeted her one by one. [[4363 旁白 neutral]]
She tried her best to imitate Su Tao's tone, slowly eliminating potential threats for these three days. [[4364 旁白 neutral]]
After finishing everything, she used her own phone to send a message to Chen Qian, "Pay attention these days. If anyone looks for Su Tao, or if she has anything unfinished, help her deal with it." [[4365 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian replied instantly, "What do you mean? I'm already your double agent, and now you want me to help Su Tao?" [[4366 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Was the blackhead removal pill I gave you last time effective?" [[4367 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "You have more?" [[4368 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "This time it's for skin beautification. If you do well, I'll give it to you next time I give you medicine." [[4369 池小橙 neutral]]
Chen Qian: "Chi Xiaocheng, you know me. I've always been Su Tao's good sister. Helping her with things is my duty!" [[4370 陈倩 neutral]]
After dealing with everything, Chi Xiaocheng began to arrange her room. [[4371 旁白 neutral]]
She took out the self-adhesive stickers she bought with emotion points from the system. After pulling the curtains, she completely sealed the windows except for a few breathing holes. [[4372 旁白 neutral]]
Visibility to the outside, zero! [[4373 旁白 neutral]]
Next, she removed the wall clock and the small alarm clock on the table, and even Su Tao's wristwatch. [[4374 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, what are you doing?] [[4375 系统 neutral]]
"Of course, I'm preparing for Tao Tao to rest well. With the windows open and it so bright outside, how can she sleep?" [[4376 池小橙 neutral]]
"If there are too many alarm clocks, she'll look at the time too much, and looking at the time too much will cause stress, which is also not good." [[4377 池小橙 neutral]]
Although there were only three days. [[4378 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng had a lot of tasks. [[4379 旁白 neutral]]
Her goal was simple: to change Su Tao's perception of her within these three days. [[4380 旁白 neutral]]
Not to correct this yandere. [[4381 旁白 neutral]]
But to make her realize that her yandere tendencies could no longer be corrected! [[4382 旁白 neutral]]
If it couldn't be corrected, then she could only accept it, embrace it, and like it. [[4383 旁白 neutral]]
To love! [[4384 旁白 neutral]]
Eliminate her sense of time. [[4385 旁白 neutral]]
Remove all entertainment content from the room, then fill the entire house with memories of the original owner and Su Tao. [[4386 旁白 neutral]]
Add many books about yandere yuri literature. [[4387 旁白 neutral]]
Even feeding her would have to be done by herself. [[4388 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng felt excited just thinking about it. [[4389 旁白 neutral]]
Controlling the female lead and making her fall hopelessly in love with herself. [[4390 旁白 neutral]]
It might not be achievable in a short time, but as long as she moved towards this goal, Chi Xiaocheng felt full of motivation. [[4391 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, we have a lot of time~" [[4392 池小橙 neutral]]
The sound of rain outside grew louder, but the room was incredibly quiet. [[4393 旁白 neutral]]
The room, which Chi Xiaocheng had spent a lot of time tidying up, now had almost nothing but essential items like tables, chairs, and a bed. [[4394 旁白 neutral]]
On the table were a few books, carefully selected by Chi Xiaocheng. [[4395 旁白 neutral]]
The content was all about yandere intimacy. [[4396 旁白 neutral]]
One thing to note is that the protagonists in the books acted very yandere, but never mentioned the words "yandere." [[4397 旁白 neutral]]
Claustrophobia, depression, loneliness, panic. These countless emotions can only be resolved by your beloved Xiaocheng. [[4398 旁白 neutral]]
Time flew by, and gradually, Su Tao woke up. [[4399 旁白 neutral]]
It was evening, but Chi Xiaocheng had tried it. The system's medicine was very potent. She had slept for six hours after taking it. [[4400 旁白 neutral]]
When she woke up, she felt like she had slept for a month, her whole body feeling refreshed. [[4401 旁白 neutral]]
One hundred times the energy, but she had to wait for the after-effects to pass. [[4402 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao was currently in the midst of those after-effects. [[4403 旁白 neutral]]
Her head was heavy, her body weak. She tried to cover her head, but found that for some reason, she couldn't exert any strength in her hands. [[4404 旁白 neutral]]
What time is it now? [[4405 旁白 neutral]]
What did Xiaocheng do to me? [[4406 旁白 neutral]]
What happened after that cup of black tea? [[4407 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao blinked hard, and her vision slowly returned. [[4408 旁白 neutral]]
What met her eyes was Chi Xiaocheng, sitting astride a chair, her hands resting on the armrests, her chin resting on her arms, watching with a smile. [[4409 旁白 neutral]]
"Did you sleep well?" [[4410 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's question made Su Tao quickly recall the scene. [[4411 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to move, but still couldn't exert any strength. [[4412 旁白 neutral]]
She could only lie on the bed, turning her head to look at Chi Xiaocheng. [[4413 旁白 neutral]]
Her throat was very dry, as if smoking. [[4414 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao coughed dryly, licked her dry lips, and then looked at Chi Xiaocheng and asked, "Xiaocheng, what... what did you do to me?" [[4415 苏桃 neutral]]
"Nothing?" Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head cutely, "I just thought you were too tired, Tao Tao, and wanted you to get some good rest." [[4416 池小橙 neutral]]
Rest? [[4417 旁白 neutral]]
Here? [[4418 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked around. The room was clean and simple, and the windows were completely sealed with unknown black cloth. [[4419 旁白 neutral]]
Recalling what she knew about yanderes, her heart sank. [[4420 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, she didn't lose her mind. [[4421 旁白 neutral]]
Anyway, Xiaocheng is very weak. After she regains her strength, she can just subdue her and talk to her properly. [[4422 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, don't provoke her, and don't mention anything that just happened. Just slowly change the subject and distract her. [[4423 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Su Tao forced a smile, "Xiaocheng, I'm a little thirsty. Can I have some water?" [[4424 苏桃 neutral]]
Most importantly, regain strength. [[4425 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled, "Of course you can." [[4426 池小橙 neutral]]
She had experienced the feeling of a smoky throat after waking up, so she had prepared a cup of warm water early. She walked to Su Tao's bedside, "But you can't get up now, how will you drink?" [[4427 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao opened her mouth, "I should be able to do it slowly." [[4428 苏桃 neutral]]
After speaking, she saw Chi Xiaocheng raise her small head, smiling eerily, "No, Tao Tao is sick and needs care. You should say—Xiaocheng, feed me some water." [[4429 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao blinked, and said with a dry laugh, "Then Xiaocheng, can you feed me some water?" [[4430 苏桃 neutral]]
"Of course~" [[4431 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head back and poured half a cup of water into her mouth. [[4432 旁白 neutral]]
Then she sat on the edge of Su Tao's bed. [[4433 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiao... Xiaocheng?" [[4434 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's pupils contracted, as if she had guessed what Chi Xiaocheng was about to do, and her breathing became unnaturally rapid. [[4435 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled faintly. [[4436 旁白 neutral]]
... [[4437 旁白 neutral]]
"Ugh—!" [[4438 苏桃 sad]]
