Chapter 258: Too Many Accidents [[21986 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took her phone and slipped out of the room. A cloak covered her small body and a hood hid her face, helping her avoid the cameras. [[21987 旁白 neutral]]
The cloak lowered her presence and kept her face from being photographed, but it didn't make her invisible. [[21988 旁白 neutral]]
She still had to be careful. [[21989 旁白 neutral]]
In the darkness, she was as agile as a cat. Even a person with sharp eyes would only see two brown pigtails, like silk ribbons, floating in the air and leaving a faint scent behind. [[21990 旁白 neutral]]
Strictly speaking, Su Tao wasn't the only person Chi Xiaocheng cared about. [[21991 旁白 neutral]]
There was her brother, Chi Song, and her parents back home. [[21992 旁白 neutral]]
In a broader sense, Su Tao might not be the "only one." [[21993 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng knew that if Su Tao were not in this world, she probably wouldn't have any desire to keep living. [[21994 旁白 sad]]
After experiencing such gentleness when she was at her coldest and most afraid, she could never let it go. [[21995 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving the hospital, Chi Xiaocheng hailed a taxi. [[21996 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't have time for more investigation, so she could only head back to Si Chen's villa first. [[21997 旁白 neutral]]
When the taxi was halfway there, Chi Xiaocheng received a message from Si Chen. [[21998 旁白 neutral]]
"Bad news. Lin Fangya has disappeared. After the Ye family's second young master handed her over to us, Dongfang Yang had some bodyguards drive her to the hospital." [[21999 司辰 neutral]]
"But they got into a car accident on the way. The bodyguards were injured to different degrees, but Lin Fangya is gone." [[22000 司辰 neutral]]
"She was injured, unconscious, and tied up at the time." [[22001 司辰 neutral]]
Si Chen's message made Chi Xiaocheng narrow her eyes. [[22002 旁白 neutral]]
Could an accident really happen that easily? [[22003 池小橙 neutral]]
"System, what do you think? Could it be that the second young master of the Ye family didn't want to hand her over, so he planned this?" [[22004 池小橙 neutral]]
[It's also possible that the world's will doesn't want this character to leave the story so soon.] [[22005 系统 neutral]]
"But this character isn't that important, right?" [[22006 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng really couldn't understand how Lin Fangya, who was just a character for Su Tao to defeat in the original novel and wasn't very smart, was doing so well. [[22007 旁白 neutral]]
The current situation was straying further and further from the original plot, and Lin Fangya's changes made Chi Xiaocheng feel a little uneasy. [[22008 旁白 neutral]]
She typed a question to Si Chen, "Where did the car accident happen?" [[22009 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "Xiangyang North Road." [[22010 司辰 neutral]]
Xiangyang North Road? Isn't that just about two kilometers south of my home? [[22011 池小橙 neutral]]
After getting the information, Chi Xiaocheng turned to the driver and said, "Sir, please change the route. Go to Xiangyang North Road." [[22012 池小橙 neutral]]
"Okay." [[22013 司机 neutral]]
The driver gave Chi Xiaocheng a strange look but didn't say much. After a red light, he changed the destination. [[22014 旁白 neutral]]
They drove all the way and arrived at the destination. She got out of the car. [[22015 旁白 neutral]]
The area was blocked off by traffic police, so she couldn't see the crash site. Did this mean the trail to Lin Fangya was now cold? [[22016 旁白 neutral]]
The last time she made an enemy of this person because of Ye Liang, it was all in secret. [[22017 旁白 neutral]]
With her escape this time, their conflict was now out in the open. [[22018 旁白 neutral]]
Last time, this woman was able to hire a sniper to assassinate Taotao. [[22019 旁白 neutral]]
What dangerous thing would she do this time, now that she had become even more crazy? [[22020 旁白 neutral]]
"No, I have to find her!" [[22021 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's sixth sense told her that if she didn't get rid of this person, things could become very difficult later. [[22022 旁白 neutral]]
She went to a dark and somewhat dirty place, took a pill, and cupped her hands around her mouth to amplify the sound. [[22023 旁白 neutral]]
"Meow~ Meow~" [[22024 池小橙 neutral]]
Two cute meows came from Chi Xiaocheng's mouth. Soon, a few responding meows came from the dark bushes and garbage cans. [[22025 旁白 neutral]]
With her affinity skill activated and the pill she had taken, Chi Xiaocheng could briefly communicate with these small animals. [[22026 旁白 neutral]]
A few stray cats came out, understood what Chi Xiaocheng meant, and ran back. [[22027 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a slightly injured and dirty tabby cat was led out, surrounded by the others. [[22028 旁白 neutral]]
Behind the tabby cat, besides several other stray cats, was a clean and unusually special Ragdoll cat. [[22029 旁白 neutral]]
After a closer look, Chi Xiaocheng realized that the leading tabby cat looked very familiar. [[22030 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until the tabby cat paused and then let out a silly-sounding meow that Chi Xiaocheng understood why it felt so familiar. [[22031 旁白 neutral]]
She asked the tabby cat, "Da Wang?" [[22032 池小橙 neutral]]
"Meow!!" [[22033 大王 happy]]
Perhaps because the cloak hid her scent, Da Wang didn't recognize Chi Xiaocheng at first. It was only when she called out that it excitedly jumped up. [[22034 旁白 neutral]]
It tried to leap into Chi Xiaocheng's arms but was pushed aside with disgust. [[22035 旁白 neutral]]
"I don't have time to hold you now, and you're too dirty. I've only been away from home for a few days, how did you end up like this?" [[22036 池小橙 angry]]
"Meeow~" [[22037 大王 sad]]
Pushed to the side, Da Wang felt a bit wronged. [[22038 旁白 neutral]]
It hadn't seen Chi Xiaocheng for two months, and now she wouldn't even give it a hug. [[22039 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, you shouldn't get attached to a species like a cat owner! [[22040 旁白 neutral]]
But what concerned Chi Xiaocheng more were the injuries on Da Wang. [[22041 旁白 neutral]]
They looked like scratches from another animal. [[22042 旁白 neutral]]
Then she pouted with dissatisfaction, "Taotao, really... Hasn't she come home to see Da Wang all this time? It's so hungry it's fighting with others over trash." [[22043 池小橙 angry]]
No matter how silly this cat was, it held memories of her and Taotao. [[22044 旁白 neutral]]
Is Taotao not cherishing these memories? [[22045 池小橙 angry]]
Your Xiaocheng's affection for you has greatly decreased! [[22046 池小橙 angry]]
Minus... minus 10 points! [[22047 池小橙 angry]]
Uh... never mind, 10 is too much. For now, just minus 1! [[22048 池小橙 neutral]]
Yes, just minus 1 for now. [[22049 池小橙 neutral]]
But right now, Da Wang was clearly not the main point. Chi Xiaocheng hadn't forgotten her purpose and asked Da Wang, "When the car accident happened over there, did you... or your little followers, see anyone run from the car?" [[22050 池小橙 neutral]]
"Meow?" [[22051 大王 neutral]]
Da Wang tilted its head, finding it hard to understand Chi Xiaocheng's long sentence. [[22052 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew that Da Wang's brain was overloading. [[22053 旁白 neutral]]
After waiting for a while, Da Wang went behind the Ragdoll cat and nudged its white fur. [[22054 旁白 neutral]]
The white Ragdoll cat whimpered timidly. Having taken the pill, Chi Xiaocheng instantly understood what it meant. [[22055 旁白 neutral]]
So, the person had escaped down a small path, heading toward the city outskirts. [[22056 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng reached out and patted Da Wang's head. "Let's go, Da Wang. Put your sense of smell to use. Today, we are a master-and-servant team!" [[22057 池小橙 happy]]
After meowing at the Ragdoll cat, Da Wang immediately ran to Chi Xiaocheng's feet. [[22058 旁白 neutral]]
Following the narrow path, they soon came to a main road leading to the suburbs. [[22059 旁白 neutral]]
On both sides of the road were tall fields of wild grass. [[22060 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang twitched its nose a few times and led Chi Xiaocheng into a patch of grass. [[22061 旁白 neutral]]
This made Chi Xiaocheng wonder if Da Wang was a tabby cat or a dog. [[22062 旁白 neutral]]
How could its tracking be so accurate? [[22063 旁白 neutral]]
After walking a few more steps, Chi Xiaocheng finally understood why Da Wang found the target so precisely. [[22064 旁白 neutral]]
In the air, there was a faint smell of blood. [[22065 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pulled her hood down lower, moved quietly, and soon reached an old, dilapidated shack. [[22066 旁白 neutral]]
There was a fishy smell in the area, and she could see fishing rods stuck in the ground nearby. [[22067 旁白 neutral]]
Further ahead, she could hear the sound of water, a clear sign that this was a regular spot for fishermen. [[22068 旁白 neutral]]
Before she even got close to the shack, as the smell of blood grew stronger, Chi Xiaocheng heard a man talking with Lin Fangya. [[22069 旁白 neutral]]
