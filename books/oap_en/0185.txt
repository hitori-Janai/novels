Chapter 185: If Only This Wasn't a Dream [[16157 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike the cold winter with its sky full of snow, the morning sun was incredibly bright. The lush trees and tall buildings in the distance were tinted with a layer of orange-gold gauze. [[16158 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if it was telling the story of her heart's release. [[16159 旁白 neutral]]
Winter goes, spring comes. [[16160 旁白 neutral]]
Sunlight filtered through the dense leaves, scattering onto the stone steps, creating specks of light that made the entire path feel gentle and warm, and it also fell on the bright orange hooded jacket of the girl in front of her. [[16161 旁白 neutral]]
An orange hairpin, incredibly familiar from memory and still treasured in a drawer, was clipped to the side of her brown hair, complementing the color of her clothes. [[16162 旁白 neutral]]
Her delicate and cute little face wore a familiar smile, the same one as in her memories. [[16163 旁白 neutral]]
It was a sharp contrast to the cold her on the hospital bed. [[16164 旁白 neutral]]
While Su Tao was still in a daze, the gentle breeze, as if understanding, gently lifted a strand of Chi Xiaocheng's hair. It blew a breath, like a ribbon dancing in the morning wind, carrying a faint fragrance to Su Tao's face. [[16165 旁白 neutral]]
The tip of the hair touched the tip of her nose, a clear and slightly itchy, comfortable sensation that finally brought Su Tao back to her senses. [[16166 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng was still alive. [[16167 苏桃 happy]]
She was really standing in front of her. [[16168 苏桃 happy]]
The scene before her eyes, the words she heard, and her scent—none of it was an illusion! [[16169 苏桃 happy]]
Seeing that Su Tao hadn't reacted for a long time, Chi Xiaocheng pretended to be angry and pouted, "Taotao, really. You're distracted on a date with me. What on earth are you thinking..." [[16170 池小橙 angry]]
Before she could finish her sentence, the girl in front of her suddenly rushed forward. [[16171 旁白 neutral]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng could react, she was held tightly in an embrace, and a crying voice was heard, "This is great... This is great, Xiaocheng. You're still alive, you're still alive, I... I...呜呜呜呜呜..." [[16172 苏桃 sad]]
The emotions that had been suppressed in her heart for so long were all released at this moment with her cries. [[16173 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wore a helpless smile and gently hugged Su Tao back. [[16174 池小橙 neutral]]
Her small hand gently patted her on the back. [[16175 池小橙 neutral]]
"Alright, I've always been by your side, Taotao." [[16176 池小橙 happy]]
Death is not the end, but a new beginning for you and me. [[16177 旁白 neutral]]
Counting the time, I'll be back in less than a month. [[16178 旁白 neutral]]
As if coaxing a child, Chi Xiaocheng reached out and stroked Su Tao's head, "Alright, didn't I tell you? I will never leave you. If you keep crying, your clothes will get wet." [[16179 池小橙 happy]]
However, her comfort not only had no effect but made the girl cry even harder. [[16180 旁白 neutral]]
The constant high pressure, the guilt and remorse for her, and the confusion she had temporarily overcome after finally thinking things through, were all vented at this moment. [[16181 旁白 neutral]]
She needed this hug too much. [[16182 旁白 neutral]]
And she missed it too much. [[16183 旁白 neutral]]
Just like how she had always been, when she came home tired from work, she could throw herself into her arms to vent her frustrations from the outside, to ask for and enjoy her tenderness and affection. [[16184 旁白 neutral]]
In Chi Xiaocheng's mind, the system's moved voice sounded. [[16185 旁白 neutral]]
[See, Host? You put so much pressure on her, the child couldn't take it anymore.] [[16186 系统 neutral]]
"I was indeed wrong, and I will correct it, but you know, System, my goal remains unchanged. I want Taotao to fall in love with me, to possess me." [[16187 池小橙 neutral]]
"So she also has to change, so that we might have a future together." [[16188 池小橙 neutral]]
Since two straight lines can never intersect, then find a way to bend one. [[16189 旁白 neutral]]
One day, they will intersect again. [[16190 旁白 neutral]]
"But not right now." Hugging Su Tao, enjoying the girl's softness and cries, Chi Xiaocheng smiled, "Reality is already tiring enough. After too much pain, of course you need some sweetness." [[16191 池小橙 happy]]
"No matter how eager I am to change her, I have to wait until I wake up, right?" [[16192 池小橙 neutral]]
The demonic glint in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes flashed and disappeared, quickly replaced by gentleness again. [[16193 旁白 neutral]]
After a good while, Su Tao finally stopped crying. [[16194 旁白 neutral]]
She raised her wrist to wipe her tears and sobbed, "I... I'm sorry, Xiaocheng, for making a fool of myself. I shouldn't have cried in front of you." [[16195 苏桃 sad]]
However, upon hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng became unhappy. [[16196 旁白 neutral]]
The wrist wiping away tears was quickly grabbed. [[16197 旁白 neutral]]
Looking up, she saw the little lolita pouting and saying, "Taotao, that's not right of you. Am I not the person you can rely on the most?" [[16198 池小橙 angry]]
"No, Xiaocheng, I..." [[16199 苏桃 sad]]
"Shh!" Chi Xiaocheng put her index finger to Su Tao's lips, "If you have any grievances, sad things, or if you're being bullied, you can tell me, okay? I will always listen, no matter what." [[16200 池小橙 happy]]
"I'll be happy if you cry in front of me, and I'll be happy if you vent your frustrations to me, because that way I know that you, Taotao, see me as your one and only, as the person you like the most and are closest to, so you're willing to show your most vulnerable side in front of me." [[16201 池小橙 happy]]
"Because I like you, Taotao, so no matter what, I will never dislike you." [[16202 池小橙 happy]]
After speaking, the tip of her index finger gently tapped Su Tao's lips, and she turned around with a smile. [[16203 池小橙 happy]]
"Alright, since Taotao doesn't want me to see your vulnerable side, then I won't look. But you need to pull yourself together quickly, I've been waiting for you for a while." [[16204 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao stared blankly at Chi Xiaocheng's back as she turned around, her hands clasped behind her. [[16205 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled, happy and satisfied. [[16206 苏桃 happy]]
"Mhm!" [[16207 苏桃 happy]]
After a firm nod, Su Tao quickly wiped her eyes with her hands, wanting to pull herself together quickly so as not to keep Chi Xiaocheng waiting. [[16208 旁白 neutral]]
However, she had barely looked up when a small hand held out a handkerchief to her. [[16209 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't turn around. [[16210 旁白 neutral]]
But the handkerchief with a small orange print was already in front of her. [[16211 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took the handkerchief, "Sorry... Xiaocheng, for making you worry and go to so much trouble." [[16212 苏桃 sad]]
"And about what happened before, I..." [[16213 苏桃 sad]]
She opened her mouth, wanting to apologize for the various pains she had caused her due to her avoidance in the past. [[16214 旁白 neutral]]
But the words got stuck in her throat, unable to come out. [[16215 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's helpless sigh came, "Next time, I don't want to hear 'sorry,' I want to hear 'thank you' from you, Taotao, got it?" [[16216 池小橙 neutral]]
"You can't say 'I'm sorry, I was wrong,' but you should say 'Thank you, Xiaocheng, for not blaming me,' and then strive to do better in the future." [[16217 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned around again and poked Su Tao's tear-streaked face angrily, "Today we're on a date, it's a happy day. You're not allowed to talk about those things. You have to have fun with me, understand?" [[16218 池小橙 angry]]
The familiar and warm feeling enveloped her. Su Tao wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes with the handkerchief. [[16219 苏桃 happy]]
"Okay!" [[16220 苏桃 happy]]
She reached out a hand and took Chi Xiaocheng's small hand. [[16221 旁白 neutral]]
"A date, where are we going next?" [[16222 苏桃 happy]]
She didn't avoid it like last time, calling a "date" a "shopping trip." [[16223 旁白 neutral]]
To actively love, she shouldn't be like she was before. [[16224 旁白 neutral]]
Pain, regret, confusion, guilt—let's leave them all behind. [[16225 旁白 neutral]]
In front of Xiaocheng, she just needed to be happy. [[16226 旁白 neutral]]
And in the process, try to fall in love with her. [[16227 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned and shouted loudly at a small cat on a distant wall, "King! If you don't come down now, I'm leaving you behind!" [[16228 池小橙 happy]]
"Meow!" [[16229 旁白 neutral]]
With a meow in response, the beautiful and proud tabby cat quickly ran back. [[16230 旁白 neutral]]
She held her hand, walking on the path bathed in the morning sun, with a small cat wagging its tail beside them, looking content. [[16231 旁白 neutral]]
Warmth was held in her palm, and the gentle spring breeze brushed against her pretty face. [[16232 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao tilted her head, her eyes fixed on Chi Xiaocheng's happily smiling cheeks. [[16233 苏桃 happy]]
If only this wasn't a dream. [[16234 苏桃 sad]]
How wonderful it would be. [[16235 苏桃 sad]]
