Chapter 48 Brief Tenderness [[4145 旁白 neutral]]
After doing all that, Chi Xiaocheng joyfully came to Su Tao's side, "Tao Tao, what would you like to drink? Is black tea okay?" [[4146 池小橙 happy]]
"Yes, thank you, Xiaocheng, for the trouble." [[4147 苏桃 neutral]]
Returning to this familiar house, Su Tao felt completely relaxed, whether it was because of the air conditioning or the many memories here. [[4148 旁白 neutral]]
She watched Chi Xiaocheng squatting by the cabinet under the TV, her small bottom sticking out as she searched for the black tea that she didn't know where it was. Su Tao couldn't help but find it amusing. [[4149 旁白 neutral]]
"That's strange, I remember the black tea was here, right?" [[4150 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng rubbed her head, making a silly and cute sound. [[4151 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't help but remind her, "It's in the cabinet on the right, isn't it? We put it there together when we tidied up. Did you forget already?" [[4152 苏桃 neutral]]
"Is that so?" [[4153 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't turn her head, but instead went to another cabinet to look. [[4154 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao leaned back on the sofa, watching her gently. [[4155 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze suddenly fell upon a small trinket, "This thing is still here?" [[4156 苏桃 neutral]]
She reached out. [[4157 旁白 neutral]]
Next to the box holding the remote control, hung a small necklace, with a delicately crafted peach at its end. [[4158 旁白 neutral]]
They bought this when they went to the park together during the summer vacation of their third year of high school, tricked by a bad uncle. [[4159 旁白 neutral]]
This little thing cost 30 yuan. [[4160 旁白 neutral]]
Yet, it could be bought for 5 yuan at a toy store outside. [[4161 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't even turn her head, as if she knew what Su Tao was talking about, "Because I like everything about Tao Tao. This little thing is our memory, of course I wouldn't throw it away." [[4162 池小橙 happy]]
Words that would make one blush came out of her mouth as if they were commonplace. [[4163 旁白 neutral]]
But such casual words were not teasing or playful. [[4164 旁白 neutral]]
They were just like those focused and solemn confessions. [[4165 旁白 neutral]]
Full of endless love. [[4166 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a little uncomfortable inside and skipped the topic, "Did you find the black tea?" [[4167 苏桃 neutral]]
"Found it!" [[4168 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng held a small can, "It's hidden so deep. Wait a moment, I'll go boil some water." [[4169 池小橙 neutral]]
She was like a clumsy idiot who didn't know how to do housework. After a flurry of activity, she finally poured the water into a cup. [[4170 旁白 neutral]]
However, just as she picked up the cup. [[4171 旁白 neutral]]
Her hand trembled. [[4172 旁白 neutral]]
The boiling hot water immediately spilled onto her arm. [[4173 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah—!" [[4174 池小橙 sad]]
In the kitchen, Chi Xiaocheng screamed, attracting Su Tao's attention. [[4175 旁白 neutral]]
The girl anxiously ran from the sofa. [[4176 旁白 neutral]]
What met her eyes was a reddened arm and steaming water stains on the floor. [[4177 旁白 neutral]]
She immediately washed the handkerchief she carried with cold water and, while treating the burn, couldn't help but scold, "Seriously, you burned yourself again. How can you be so careless?" [[4178 苏桃 sad]]
"S-sorry." Chi Xiaocheng bit her lower lip, tears as big as beans seemingly about to squeeze out of her eyes. [[4179 池小橙 sad]]
Seeing this, Su Tao's heart softened, and her scolding tone also softened. [[4180 旁白 neutral]]
She took Chi Xiaocheng's hand, "Let's go out first, I'll treat you." [[4181 苏桃 neutral]]
She made Chi Xiaocheng sit on the sofa, while she knelt in front, gently wiping her forearm with a towel, her eyes focused and gentle. [[4182 旁白 neutral]]
"Does it hurt?" [[4183 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao asked softly. [[4184 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng shook her head, "It doesn't hurt." [[4185 池小橙 neutral]]
As she spoke, she stared intently at Su Tao's pretty, fair face, then her gaze fell on her focused movements, and her eyes couldn't help but show a hint of satisfaction. [[4186 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, did you burn yourself on purpose?] [[4187 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng just curled her lips, not answering. [[4188 旁白 neutral]]
Who knows if it was intentional. [[4189 旁白 neutral]]
I'm just a clumsy little guy, just like the original owner. [[4190 旁白 neutral]]
Isn't it normal to get hurt? [[4191 旁白 neutral]]
Only then will Tao Tao care about me and feel sorry for me. [[4192 旁白 neutral]]
Unconsciously, Chi Xiaocheng's lips curved into an eerie smile, like a hunter looking at its prey, as she stared at Su Tao, who was squatting in front of her, treating her injury. [[4193 旁白 neutral]]
When Su Tao's gaze fell upon her, Chi Xiaocheng quickly transformed into a pitiful, self-reproaching little girl. [[4194 旁白 neutral]]
She sobbed and asked, "Tao Tao, am I... am I very clumsy?" [[4195 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao applied gauze to Chi Xiaocheng, then stood up and patted her head with a smile, "Yes, you've always been clumsy. Boiling water is going to be your lifelong enemy. You've been burned a few times before, haven't you? You never learn." [[4196 苏桃 neutral]]
"Sorry..." [[4197 池小橙 sad]]
"Then be careful next time, okay?" Su Tao said with concern. After putting away the first-aid kit, she went to clean the kitchen. [[4198 苏桃 neutral]]
Then she skillfully brewed tea. [[4199 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, what would you like to drink?" [[4200 苏桃 neutral]]
"Whatever you like~" [[4201 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's answer made Su Tao's hand, holding the cup, tremble. [[4202 旁白 neutral]]
Then she heard Chi Xiaocheng's voice again, "I can drink anything, as long as Tao Tao likes it." [[4203 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao's lips curved into a smile. [[4204 旁白 neutral]]
She's always been like this, so cute. [[4205 旁白 neutral]]
It's truly puzzling that such cuteness also has a pathological side. [[4206 旁白 neutral]]
A cup of coconut juice and a cup of hot black tea were brought out together. [[4207 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat obediently on the sofa, her two slender legs not reaching the ground, her feet in white socks dangling, looking very cute. [[4208 旁白 neutral]]
This scene reminded Su Tao of the time before she graduated from high school. [[4209 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, Brother Chi Song had just gotten this house, and both of them were surprised and curious. [[4210 旁白 neutral]]
Every weekend, they would live together here for two days. [[4211 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, Chi Xiaocheng was just like this. She would cook in the kitchen, and Chi Xiaocheng would obediently sit here watching TV. [[4212 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she was constantly watching her. [[4213 旁白 neutral]]
Whenever she looked over, this cute little one would respond with a warm and healing smile. [[4214 旁白 neutral]]
Is such a Xiaocheng really a yandere? [[4215 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, relaxed by the brief warmth, remembered her purpose for being here again. [[4216 旁白 neutral]]
To test! [[4217 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to confirm whether this warmth was a fleeting illusion or an eternal truth. [[4218 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom—" [[4219 旁白 neutral]]
Thunder sounded outside, interrupting Su Tao's thoughts. She came back to her senses, and as she walked towards Chi Xiaocheng, the smile on her face gradually stiffened. [[4220 旁白 neutral]]
Don't hesitate, Su Tao! [[4221 旁白 neutral]]
This is all for Xiaocheng's good. [[4222 旁白 neutral]]
If she's a yandere, she must be treated, otherwise something will happen sooner or later. [[4223 旁白 neutral]]
She came to Chi Xiaocheng's side, placed both the orange juice and black tea on the table, and just as she was about to speak, she saw Chi Xiaocheng pull out a packet of powder from her embrace. [[4224 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao, want to add some of this?" [[4225 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the grayish-white powder curiously, "What is this?" [[4226 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng poured a glass of plain water beside her, then added a little of the powder into it, saying lightly, "This was prescribed at the hospital. The doctor uncle said it's a benign medicine that can regulate the body and dispel fatigue. You can drink it like a beverage, and he told me to add a little whenever I drink water." [[4227 池小橙 neutral]]
Then, she looked at Su Tao's slightly pale face, "Tao Tao, your complexion looks a bit off. You must be very tired these past few days, why don't you add some too?" [[4228 池小橙 neutral]]
Seeing that Chi Xiaocheng had prepared it for herself, Su Tao didn't think much of it, "Thank you, Xiaocheng." [[4229 苏桃 neutral]]
"You need to rest well." [[4230 苏桃 neutral]]
The powder slowly poured into the black tea. [[4231 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng then picked up the glass of coconut juice and took a small sip. [[4232 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of rain hitting the window, Chi Xiaocheng narrowed her eyes in enjoyment. [[4233 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao held the black tea, seemingly hesitating about something. [[4234 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, both of them fell silent. [[4235 旁白 neutral]]
The strong wind lashed against the window, and a ghostly howling sound poured in through the cracks, making one's hair stand on end. [[4236 旁白 neutral]]
For some reason, the light seemed to dim a little. [[4237 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao held the black tea and turned to look seriously at the girl with tea-colored hair beside her, "Xiaocheng, I have something to tell you!" [[4238 苏桃 neutral]]
