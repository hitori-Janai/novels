Chapter 161: Sister Su Tao, Where Did Sister Xiaocheng Go? [[14123 旁白 neutral]]
She was a small doll now, it was true, but this skill gave Chi Xiaocheng new possibilities. [[14124 旁白 neutral]]
After getting this skill, she had secretly used it once in her room. She disguised herself as a girl about her own size, and she looked flawless in the mirror. [[14125 旁白 neutral]]
It was called a disguise, but it was more like becoming someone else for a short time. She could decide the person's looks, height, and weight, as long as they were normal for a person. [[14126 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, she could only use this skill once a week, and only for three hours at a time. [[14127 旁白 neutral]]
She had options, but she couldn't just try anything. For example, she definitely couldn't make a copy of herself. [[14128 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng was already pretending to be dead in a hospital bed. If another Xiaocheng showed up, it would scare everyone. [[14129 旁白 neutral]]
"System, how many Emotion Points do I have now?" [[14130 池小橙 neutral]]
[Host, you have 4399.] [[14131 系统 neutral]]
"That many?!" [[14132 池小橙 happy]]
[Host, this time your death seemed real, unlike last time when there was clearly hope. Because of this, the other characters had very strong emotional reactions, and you earned a lot of Emotion Points.] [[14133 系统 neutral]]
[However, after this event, if characters like Su Tao go through something similar again, you will get far fewer Emotion Points from them.] [[14134 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew that you get fewer Emotion Points for the same emotion if it's repeated. This was to stop people from cheating the system. [[14135 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't realize that this "death" had used up all her future potential for gaining points this way. [[14136 旁白 neutral]]
"If I have a full four thousand..." [[14137 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat in the drawer, thinking about how to use these Emotion Points. [[14138 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, she thought of something important. "System, since I'm already 'dead,' will the world's will still target me?" [[14139 池小橙 neutral]]
[No. After your death, your influence on the surface has dropped to a very low level. The main plot of the original story has not changed in a strange way. Although it was an accident, this was a very successful fake death.] [[14140 系统 neutral]]
The butterfly was dead, but the tornado from its wings would not stop. [[14141 旁白 neutral]]
The main plot hadn't changed, but many details were different now. [[14142 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang and Si Chen were on Chi Xiaocheng's side, and Xiao Ming hadn't been able to connect with Su Tao. The genius doctor male lead, who should have appeared long ago, hadn't had much contact with Su Tao because she was never sick. [[14143 旁白 neutral]]
Around this time, Brother Long should have been assassinated and killed because of Chi Song's trip, but now he was leading a group of followers to Jiuzhou City himself. [[14144 旁白 neutral]]
This was the butterfly effect! [[14145 旁白 neutral]]
So, from now on, Chi Xiaocheng didn't have to worry about the world's will. [[14146 旁白 neutral]]
4399 Emotion Points... [[14147 旁白 neutral]]
"System, buy a cell phone, a mid-level hacking toolset, and Status Glasses!" [[14148 池小橙 neutral]]
It was a huge sum of 3000 Emotion Points, but Chi Xiaocheng decided to go for it. [[14149 旁白 neutral]]
[Status Glasses (3000 Emotion Points): Wear these glasses to see others' favorability and attitude toward the Host as numbers and text. The glasses can be upgraded with Emotion Points.] [[14150 系统 neutral]]
This was a great item she had wanted for a long time. [[14151 旁白 neutral]]
She could clearly see how people really felt about her. With this, she could finally know what Su Tao's feelings for her were. [[14152 旁白 neutral]]
Then, depending on the situation, she could win Taotao over. [[14153 旁白 neutral]]
All the guilt, regret, pain, and obsession must eventually turn into love. [[14154 旁白 neutral]]
And she must love only me! [[14155 旁白 neutral]]
A red light flashed in the scarecrow's eyes. Chi Xiaocheng secretly pushed open a crack in the drawer and, after making sure there was no light outside. [[14156 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly jumped out of the drawer. [[14157 旁白 neutral]]
She then leaped from the high table, landed on the soft carpet, and quickly ran to a corner of the room where dolls were usually kept. [[14158 旁白 neutral]]
From today on, she, Chi Xiaocheng, was just an ordinary doll! [[14159 旁白 neutral]]
As time passed, Su Tao chose to stay in the house full of memories instead of the school dormitory. [[14160 旁白 neutral]]
She dragged her tired body, swaying as she returned to the entrance of the residential complex. [[14161 旁白 neutral]]
Uncle Zhang was still on duty, but he was more serious than before and now carried a taser and a tranquilizer gun. [[14162 旁白 neutral]]
The security of the complex had been upgraded significantly. [[14163 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry, Little Tao." [[14164 张大爷 sad]]
Faced with Su Tao, Uncle Zhang's many emotions turned into a short sentence. [[14165 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao forced a smile and shook her head. [[14166 苏桃 sad]]
She knew what Uncle Zhang was thinking. [[14167 旁白 neutral]]
But she wouldn't blame others. The reason for Xiaocheng's death was herself. [[14168 旁白 neutral]]
The only person she would blame was herself. [[14169 旁白 neutral]]
She walked into the complex and headed to the floor where Chi Xiaocheng's home was. [[14170 旁白 neutral]]
The further she went, the colder and more depressing it felt. [[14171 旁白 neutral]]
The place, once full of memories, had become a source of her fear. [[14172 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, this was what she had left. [[14173 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stepped into the elevator and wrapped her arms around herself without thinking. [[14174 旁白 neutral]]
Her cotton jacket was thick, but she still felt very cold. [[14175 旁白 neutral]]
When the elevator doors opened, Su Tao was shocked to find a small figure already waiting at her door. [[14176 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng?" [[14177 苏桃 sad]]
For a moment, the similar small frame made Su Tao see a vision of Chi Xiaocheng. [[14178 旁白 neutral]]
No, that's not Xiaocheng. Her hair is too long, and it's not brown. [[14179 旁白 neutral]]
As the girl waiting at the door turned her head, Su Tao slowly came back to her senses and asked, "I remember you... you're the little one who usually works at the front desk in the dormitory?" [[14180 苏桃 neutral]]
Her thick, long hair fell to her hips, and a few scars marked the side of her face. Her long bangs nearly covered one of her eyes. [[14181 旁白 neutral]]
She was even smaller than Chi Xiaocheng. [[14182 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning gave Su Tao a sweet smile. "Hello, Sister Su Tao. My name is Fang Ning. I always say hello when you come back to the dorm. Have you forgotten?" [[14183 方柠 happy]]
Hearing this, Su Tao finally remembered. [[14184 旁白 neutral]]
About half a month ago, a new young dorm manager had appeared in her dormitory building. [[14185 旁白 neutral]]
She was usually a cute mascot at the front desk on the first floor, sometimes helping students with their takeout orders. At night, she would secretly let late students in without writing down their names. [[14186 旁白 neutral]]
Her small and cute appearance made many of the girls want to protect her. When she first arrived, many people in the dorm were talking about her. [[14187 旁白 neutral]]
But at that time, Su Tao was under a lot of pressure and had mostly overlooked this person. [[14188 旁白 neutral]]
Realizing this, Su Tao tried to hide her sadness over Chi Xiaocheng's death and managed a smile. "Sorry, I've been busy and didn't really notice." [[14189 苏桃 neutral]]
Fang Ning put her hands behind her back and slowly shook her head. "It's okay. I don't have much of a presence anyway." [[14190 方柠 neutral]]
Su Tao asked, "So, Fang Ning, are you here... waiting for me?" [[14191 苏桃 neutral]]
But how does she know I live at Xiaocheng's house? [[14192 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe... she's not waiting for me? [[14193 旁白 neutral]]
A bad feeling suddenly rose in Su Tao's heart. [[14194 旁白 neutral]]
Then she saw Fang Ning give a shy smile. "Well, I wasn't exactly waiting for you, Sister Su Tao. I was actually here to find Sister Xiaocheng, but no one answered the doorbell, so I thought I'd wait to see if she would come back." [[14195 方柠 neutral]]
After speaking, Fang Ning looked behind Su Tao. [[14196 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like she was looking for a certain small figure. [[14197 旁白 neutral]]
She looked up at Su Tao with an innocent and expectant face. "Sister Su Tao, didn't Sister Xiaocheng come back with you?" [[14198 方柠 neutral]]
