Chapter 207: Is She Human or Ghost? [[18093 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, there are seven days left until your revival. The basic body repair is 80% complete. Starting tomorrow at noon, your heart will begin to beat again." [[18094 系统 neutral]]
"At that time, you can transfer your consciousness back to your original body at will. However, in a vegetative state, you will be unable to move or wake up. You will only be able to hear and sense what is happening around you." [[18095 系统 neutral]]
"Current body status: Suspended animation." [[18096 系统 neutral]]
"Next state: Moderately frail." [[18097 系统 neutral]]
"Time until awakening: 7 days, 12 hours." [[18098 系统 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, it was already February. [[18099 旁白 neutral]]
The cold winter was coming to an end. New sprouts pushed stubbornly through the snow, signaling that spring was near. [[18100 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew she was about to be revived and looked forward to seeing her Tao Tao after she came back. [[18101 旁白 happy]]
To feel her breath, her warmth, and her care and concern for her. [[18102 旁白 happy]]
But what she hadn't expected was that the method of her revival involved self-healing through "orange cells," which could even restart a heart that had stopped. [[18103 旁白 neutral]]
This outcome had its pros and cons. [[18104 旁白 neutral]]
The downside, of course, would be Su Tao's expression of extreme surprise, even disbelief, when she 'came back to life.' [[18105 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had imagined this scene more than once: Su Tao, growing more lonely in her absence, becoming numb to life. She would occasionally visit the hospital to look at her body and remember their happy past. [[18106 旁白 sad]]
Then, she would regret not acting differently, not making the right choice back then. [[18107 旁白 sad]]
After being overwhelmed by pain and torment, one day she would drag her weary body back to the hospital. [[18108 旁白 sad]]
Only to see her, sitting quietly and obediently on the hospital bed. [[18109 旁白 happy]]
Covered by a white sheet, wearing a small hospital gown, with a sweet, expectant smile beneath her brown hair. [[18110 旁白 happy]]
And then she would say to her. [[18111 旁白 happy]]
"—Tao Tao, welcome home." [[18112 池小橙 happy]]
Even though it was a hospital. [[18113 旁白 neutral]]
"But wherever I am, that's your home." [[18114 旁白 happy]]
However, this was just a vision of the future Chi Xiaocheng had before her feigned death. [[18115 旁白 neutral]]
It might even belong to a different timeline. [[18116 旁白 neutral]]
But in this timeline, she had softened, and Su Tao's resilience was also very strong. [[18117 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't bear to watch from afar as Su Tao was crushed by pressure, gradually falling into pain, and finally becoming numb, breaking down, or even considering taking her own life. [[18118 旁白 sad]]
She had experienced the feeling of being abandoned, and it was terrible. [[18119 旁白 sad]]
So she gave her dreams, gave her hope, and guided her forward. [[18120 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao's resilience wasn't crushed by the pressure. In her absence, she moved forward step by step, holding her head high to keep her tears from falling. [[18121 旁白 neutral]]
Now, Chi Xiaocheng was different again. [[18122 旁白 neutral]]
Letting Tao Tao know she would revive someday might be a good thing. [[18123 旁白 neutral]]
She would keep looking forward to it, maybe even pray to some vague deity, and spend more time on her revitalized self. [[18124 旁白 neutral]]
What happens in the moment when that anticipation, built to its peak, is suddenly let down? [[18125 旁白 neutral]]
You don't know what you've got until it's gone. [[18126 旁白 neutral]]
She understood, but not enough. [[18127 旁白 neutral]]
"If your possessiveness towards me isn't overflowing, won't you go and interact with other people?" [[18128 旁白 angry]]
She looked forward to waking up even more eagerly. [[18129 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng said to the System, "Transfer my consciousness over tomorrow at noon, after my heart starts beating." [[18130 池小橙 neutral]]
"Okay." [[18131 系统 neutral]]
The night passed quickly. [[18132 旁白 neutral]]
The good news was that Da Wang had become much more obedient since he could communicate simply. [[18133 旁白 happy]]
Although he still occasionally carried her around in his mouth. [[18134 旁白 neutral]]
But by noon the next day, before her heart had even restarted, a small accident caused her to return to her body ahead of schedule. [[18135 旁白 neutral]]
Her consciousness expanded outwards, and she could clearly hear the faint "beep-beep" of the various instruments attached to her. [[18136 旁白 neutral]]
But more noticeable than that sound was the conversation coming from outside the door. [[18137 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Su Tao, don't worry. I, Chu Lingfeng, have seen it all. My Taiyi Thirteen Needles technique has been praised by countless people!" [[18138 楚凌风 neutral]]
"No matter the illness, no matter how severe the injury, as long as the person isn't dead, I can bring them back!" [[18139 楚凌风 neutral]]
Along with that somewhat punchable, arrogant voice, Chi Xiaocheng heard another clear and sweet voice, "Even in a state of feigned death?" [[18140 苏桃 neutral]]
"Feigned death is just a symptom, not true death. Of course it's not a problem." [[18141 楚凌风 neutral]]
"That's wonderful! If you can wake Xiaocheng, Divine Doctor Chu, I'll definitely have Dongfang Yang thank you properly. He can recommend you to the higher-ups. Then maybe we can find solutions for cancer and AIDS that have troubled people for years!" [[18142 苏桃 happy]]
"Um... why don't we take a look at your friend's condition first." [[18143 楚凌风 neutral]]
He tactfully avoided the topic. [[18144 旁白 neutral]]
Then, Su Tao pushed open the half-closed door. [[18145 旁白 neutral]]
The ones who entered were none other than Su Tao and Chu Lingfeng. [[18146 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was now "hiding" in her body. Listening to their conversation, she felt a little unhappy. [[18147 旁白 angry]]
She had only been inattentive for one night and one morning. [[18148 旁白 angry]]
And Su Tao had gone to find this Chu Lingfeng again! [[18149 旁白 angry]]
Whether in the original novel or in his current real self, this guy was rotten to the core. Why did she still get close to him? [[18150 旁白 angry]]
Tao Tao is being naughty. Chengcheng is not happy. [[18151 旁白 angry]]
But she couldn't do anything right now, so she just listened to Chu Lingfeng brag. [[18152 旁白 neutral]]
Then, under Su Tao's expectant gaze and Professor Su's observation, Chu Lingfeng walked to the head of the bed. [[18153 旁白 neutral]]
His eyes fell on Chi Xiaocheng's face. [[18154 旁白 neutral]]
He paused for two seconds. [[18155 旁白 neutral]]
"What the hell!" [[18156 楚凌风 angry]]
Chu Lingfeng quickly took a step back, his flailing hand nearly yanking out the wire of a medical instrument. [[18157 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao and Professor Su looked over at the same time. "What's wrong?" [[18158 苏桃 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng swallowed nervously, a look of fear on his face. "Miss Su Tao, this person... is she really your friend?" [[18159 楚凌风 sad]]
"Yes." [[18160 苏桃 neutral]]
"But didn't you say she was in an accident a month ago and entered a state of feigned death?" [[18161 楚凌风 sad]]
This person was clearly the assassin he had seen at the birthday banquet! [[18162 旁白 neutral]]
Even though she wore a hood, he had only caught a clear glimpse of the girl's face in the stunning moment his ear was sliced off. [[18163 旁白 neutral]]
But he would never forget those cat-like, crimson vertical pupils and that small face, a mixture of cute and cold beauty. [[18164 旁白 neutral]]
And now you're telling me she died a month ago? [[18165 旁白 angry]]
Then what did I see that night? [[18166 旁白 neutral]]
A ghost? [[18167 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng quickly turned to Professor Su. "Doctor, can I see her various reports?" [[18168 楚凌风 neutral]]
His completely undignified manner made Professor Su frown. [[18169 旁白 neutral]]
But considering Dongfang Yang's instructions, she nodded. [[18170 旁白 neutral]]
She took some reports from a drawer. "I can only show you some of the basic reports." [[18171 苏教授 neutral]]
She wouldn't hand over the deeper reports about the cells and Chi Xiaocheng's physical condition. [[18172 旁白 neutral]]
But this was enough for Chu Lingfeng. [[18173 旁白 neutral]]
He eagerly looked at the date. [[18174 旁白 neutral]]
"Starting from a month ago... gunshot wound... heart stopped but body is in good condition... preliminary diagnosis is shock-induced feigned death... has not yet awakened..." [[18175 楚凌风 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng quickly looked at the electrocardiogram next to him, which showed a flat line. [[18176 旁白 neutral]]
If this person had really been lying here for a month, or was dead, then at the banquet... [[18177 旁白 sad]]
His lips felt a little dry. He turned stiffly. "Miss Su Tao, this girl, does she have a twin sister?" [[18178 楚凌风 sad]]
Su Tao was puzzled by Chu Lingfeng's reaction. "Divine Doctor Chu, Xiaocheng and I grew up together. What does this have to do with her condition?" [[18179 苏桃 neutral]]
Now, Chu Lingfeng was even more hesitant to step forward. [[18180 旁白 neutral]]
He was no longer sure if he had encountered a ghost or something else. [[18181 旁白 sad]]
Were the hallucinations he had last time really just hallucinations? [[18182 旁白 sad]]
And just then, the electrocardiogram next to them made a "beep." [[18183 旁白 neutral]]
The previously flat line began to show a slight wave. [[18184 旁白 neutral]]
