Chapter 253: Xiaocheng's Trick [[21540 旁白 neutral]]
Before the Ye family fell, the Si family was the third largest family in all of Jiuzhou City. [[21541 旁白 neutral]]
The banquet was held in the same villa area where he lived. Just outside was the most bustling part of Jiuzhou City. [[21542 旁白 neutral]]
There were big public squares, shopping streets, video game arcades, and antique alleys—so many different things to see. [[21543 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as they walked out of the villa area, both Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao were amazed by the night scenery. The lights were bright, and the streets were full of people. [[21544 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to the streets near Jiuzhou University, this area was much more lively and seemed more "wealthy." [[21545 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao turned sideways to block the wind for Chi Xiaocheng and asked, "Xiaocheng, where do you want to go next?" [[21546 苏桃 neutral]]
"Hmm..." Chi Xiaocheng glanced around before her eyes landed on the arcade. "How about we... go play some arcade games?" [[21547 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao wasn't really a fan of games, but since Chi Xiaocheng liked them, she wouldn't refuse. She nodded and said, "Alright, let's go then." [[21548 苏桃 neutral]]
On the way, Chi Xiaocheng was fascinated by all the little things, looking left and right. She saw a balloon-shooting stall, and a thought suddenly struck her. She turned to Su Tao and asked, "Sister Su Tao, while I was sick and away from home, how did you sleep?" [[21549 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao blinked, confused. "What do you mean, how did I sleep? I slept alone." [[21550 苏桃 neutral]]
"? [[21551 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng typed out a question mark. [[21552 旁白 neutral]]
She was a bit speechless. [[21553 旁白 neutral]]
This blockhead, couldn't she even say something like, "I thought about you every day and couldn't fall asleep"? [[21554 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said helplessly, "I mean, did you sleep hugging the Big King, or something else? How about we play the shooting game and win a... stuffed toy?" [[21555 池小橙 neutral]]
That big brown bear at home seemed to be a little too favored by Tao Tao. [[21556 旁白 neutral]]
Last time, she hugged that big brown bear instead of choosing to hug me, her scarecrow doll. [[21557 旁白 neutral]]
She even held the big brown bear with her legs! [[21558 旁白 neutral]]
I think the quality of this big brown bear is pretty bad anyway, it's not even that comfortable to hug. Maybe one day its yarn will fall apart just like the old panda doll. [[21559 旁白 neutral]]
Perfect, there's a big, soft-looking Wolfy doll over at the shooting game. [[21560 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how dense Su Tao was, she understood what Chi Xiaocheng meant. She didn't know whether to laugh or cry and said, "If you like that Wolfy, I'll win it for you. Watch me!" [[21561 苏桃 happy]]
Without another word, she pulled Chi Xiaocheng over to the balloon-shooting game. [[21562 旁白 neutral]]
The stall owner was a cheerful man who said to them, "Want to play, young ladies? It's 10 yuan for one try. You get 10 balloons of different sizes, and each one has a prize." [[21563 摊主 neutral]]
He eagerly explained the rules to Su Tao. [[21564 旁白 neutral]]
Among the 10 balloons, there were 5 large, 4 medium, and 1 small. [[21565 旁白 neutral]]
A large balloon let you pick any regular doll, a medium one let you pick a high-quality doll over 50cm, and the small balloon would win the grand prize: the Wolfy doll that was over a meter tall. [[21566 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the regular dolls. Even the smallest was 30cm tall. She squeezed one and the material felt top-notch. [[21567 旁白 neutral]]
It was a bit different from a normal stall, and Su Tao knew these kinds of games might have tricks with the guns or balloons. [[21568 旁白 neutral]]
But for 10 yuan, as long as you hit one balloon, you wouldn't lose money. [[21569 旁白 neutral]]
Assuming you could hit one. [[21570 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao specifically asked the owner, "Will you replace the balloons with a new set in the middle of a game?" [[21571 苏桃 neutral]]
"Nope." The owner smiled. "You can keep shooting until you hit them all. But let me tell you, even though it's only a 5-meter distance, it's not easy. My Wolfy doll here is worth almost a thousand yuan." [[21572 摊主 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes lit up when she heard that. "Really? Let me search for it online!" [[21573 池小橙 happy]]
The owner gave an awkward laugh. "Alright, fine, it's 500. But if you can win it for less than that, I'll take the loss!" [[21574 摊主 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng searched based on what the owner said and actually found it online. [[21575 旁白 neutral]]
A 599-yuan Wolfy doll, much more expensive than the big brown bear at home. [[21576 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao checked her remaining balance. She only had 300 yuan left. Although she'd never shot a gun before, surely she could hit the small balloon in 30 tries, right? [[21577 旁白 neutral]]
While she was still hesitating, she heard Chi Xiaocheng's hopeful voice, "Sister Su Tao, I want it~" [[21578 池小橙 happy]]
Hearing this, Su Tao slapped her hand on the table. "Alright, let's start with... five tries!" [[21579 苏桃 neutral]]
She scanned the code and paid 50 yuan. [[21580 旁白 neutral]]
After the owner handed her the gun, Su Tao weighed it in her hands and got into a shooting stance she remembered from TV, looking quite professional. [[21581 旁白 neutral]]
As she was aiming, she caught a glimpse of Chi Xiaocheng holding up her phone, seemingly taking photos and videos. [[21582 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, Su Tao straightened her back, her expression serious and focused. [[21583 旁白 neutral]]
"Huuu..." [[21584 旁白 neutral]]
One shot. I have to make it in one shot! [[21585 旁白 neutral]]
That way, Xiaocheng's admiration for me will reach its peak, and this outing will have the best start! [[21586 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang—" [[21587 旁白 neutral]]
The special Type 95 rifle in her hand made a sound, but... [[21588 旁白 neutral]]
It missed. [[21589 旁白 neutral]]
None of the 10 balloons popped. [[21590 旁白 neutral]]
Both girls were stunned for a moment. The owner kept his smiling expression. [[21591 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked a bit embarrassed. "Watch closely, Xiaocheng. I'll definitely get it on the next shot!" [[21592 苏桃 neutral]]
However, after using up the remaining four shots, Su Tao had only hit one large balloon, which meant she could only pick a regular doll. [[21593 旁白 sad]]
And they already had plenty of those at home. [[21594 旁白 neutral]]
The owner rubbed his hands together. "Aw, what a shame, no grand prize. But the regular dolls are cute too. Normally, I lose money if someone hits one in five shots." [[21595 摊主 neutral]]
He looked at Chi Xiaocheng. "Go ahead and pick one, little sister." [[21596 摊主 neutral]]
Su Tao rolled her eyes at the owner. There was no way he was losing money. [[21597 旁白 neutral]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng could say anything, Su Tao had already scanned the code again. "Don't pick yet, Xiaocheng. Wait for me to try another round!" [[21598 苏桃 neutral]]
But in the end, she spent all 300 yuan and still didn't hit the small balloon. After more than 20 shots, she had only managed to hit one large and one medium balloon. [[21599 旁白 sad]]
She spent 300 yuan and only popped 3 out of 10 balloons! [[21600 旁白 sad]]
What a total ripoff. [[21601 旁白 sad]]
Seeing this, the owner's expression was bright and confident. [[21602 旁白 neutral]]
He had his reasons for being so bold. Last time, a streamer who specialized in exposing rigged stalls came to get content, but ended up losing two thousand yuan without winning the grand prize. [[21603 旁白 neutral]]
What chance did a little girl who had never practiced shooting have? [[21604 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao's troubled expression, Chi Xiaocheng hesitated. "Sister Su Tao, maybe we should just forget it?" [[21605 池小橙 neutral]]
"Forget it?" Su Tao was getting heated, her voice rising. "No way! Since you like it, I will definitely get it for you!" [[21606 苏桃 angry]]
Time to use my credit! [[21607 旁白 angry]]
Darn it, I'll just have to shamelessly get free hospital meals tomorrow, but I have to win this Wolfy for Xiaocheng! [[21608 旁白 angry]]
Sweat from anxiety and effort began to appear on Su Tao's pretty face. Chi Xiaocheng watched from the side, feeling a little happy. [[21609 旁白 neutral]]
Although Tao Tao was a blockhead, this determined side of her was just another way of showing she cared, wasn't it? [[21610 旁白 happy]]
She didn't even need to wear her status glasses to know her affection points had definitely gone up by 1. [[21611 旁白 happy]]
However, another 200 yuan from her credit was gone, and she still hadn't won the Wolfy. [[21612 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao was about to completely lose her cool. After 50 shots, even with your eyes closed, you should be able to hit it with a bit of luck, right? [[21613 旁白 angry]]
This was too weird. Her luck usually wasn't this bad. [[21614 旁白 neutral]]
Of course she couldn't win. This owner was a clever one; Chi Xiaocheng knew he had rigged the game without even having to guess. [[21615 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[21616 旁白 neutral]]
Mr. Owner, you're being a bit mean, making my Tao Tao suffer like this. [[21617 旁白 angry]]
Just as Su Tao fired another shot bought with her credit, Chi Xiaocheng dropped her intermediate acting skills and squinted at the owner. [[21618 旁白 neutral]]
In that instant, her strange and terrifying cat-like eyes showed a flash of aggression. [[21619 旁白 angry]]
The moment the owner met her gaze, his face filled with terror. He staggered back, his body trembling, and it looked like something fell from his hand. [[21620 旁白 neutral]]
Then, a "pop" sound was heard. [[21621 旁白 neutral]]
The small balloon, which had been impossible to hit, exploded. [[21622 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao turned to Chi Xiaocheng in pleasant surprise. "Xiaocheng, I did it! I hit the small balloon!" [[21623 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head, squinted again, and gave a happy and adoring smile. "Sister Su Tao, you're amazing~" [[21624 池小橙 happy]]
