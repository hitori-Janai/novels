Chapter 173: The Irreplaceable Her [[15106 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng's height was similar to Chi Xiaocheng's, a little over 1.5 meters but not quite 1.6. The difference was that Cheng Cheng had long brown hair and wore glasses, and her eyes were a normal black color. [[15107 旁白 neutral]]
But her delicate features and face made Su Tao see an illusion of Chi Xiaocheng the moment she took off her glasses. [[15108 旁白 neutral]]
There was some resemblance, but only... a little. [[15109 旁白 neutral]]
Has my longing for Xiaocheng reached this point? [[15110 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao was a bit dazed and shook her head. [[15111 旁白 neutral]]
When she looked up, she saw the girl in front of her pouting. "Hey, Taozi, you didn't call my name just now, did you? You called for Xiaocheng, with the 'cheng' for orange?" [[15112 程程 neutral]]
"Treating someone as a substitute right after meeting them... I guess your affection for Xiaocheng isn't that strong after all." Cheng Cheng crossed her arms and huffed. "How rude." [[15113 程程 angry]]
Su Tao was already a bit embarrassed, but she became anxious when she heard this. "Cheng Cheng, that's not what I meant! My feelings for Xiaocheng are real!" [[15114 苏桃 sad]]
"Oh?" [[15115 程程 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng turned her head and pushed up her black-framed glasses, which were a bit big and old-fashioned for her. "Is that the truth?" [[15116 程程 neutral]]
"It is!" [[15117 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded very seriously. [[15118 旁白 neutral]]
However, Cheng Cheng kept staring into her eyes and asked again, "Is it really the truth? The kind of truth you would want your Xiaocheng to hear?" [[15119 程程 neutral]]
At these words, Su Tao's mouth froze. [[15120 旁白 neutral]]
If she were truly sure of her own feelings, the affection level on Chi Xiaocheng's status glasses wouldn't have even reached the passing mark. [[15121 旁白 neutral]]
Facing Cheng Cheng's doubtful gaze, Su Tao finally backed down. "Okay, it's not entirely the truth. I just feel that I should like Xiaocheng." [[15122 苏桃 sad]]
She glanced up at Cheng Cheng again, then turned her head away. [[15123 旁白 neutral]]
It felt as if the eyes behind those glasses could see right through her heart. [[15124 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed. "Xiaocheng is gone. When she was alive, she wanted me to like her. All this time, I've been... I've been constantly telling myself to like her, and now..." [[15125 苏桃 sad]]
"It's no longer about whether it's real or fake. I just like her, and no one can change that." [[15126 苏桃 sad]]
Now that she was lost, she wanted to cherish that feeling. [[15127 旁白 sad]]
She had always told herself it was just pretend affection. [[15128 旁白 sad]]
She didn't want to admit to that feeling. [[15129 旁白 sad]]
But now, she wanted to throw away the word "pretend." [[15130 旁白 sad]]
She would no longer choose to deceive Chi Xiaocheng, but to deceive herself. [[15131 旁白 sad]]
Cheng Cheng sighed. "Honestly, I came here to chat with you. We just met, so why are we talking about such a heavy topic? Go get me a coffee." [[15132 程程 neutral]]
"Cheng Cheng, why don't you get it yourself? I already paid for the cat cafe." [[15133 苏桃 neutral]]
"So rude. From now on, you have to call me Senpai, understand? Who do you think I came all this way for? Now hurry up!" [[15134 程程 angry]]
"Alright, alright. What do you want to drink?" [[15135 苏桃 neutral]]
"An Orange Americano. I want a lot of extra sugar." [[15136 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao paused for a moment when she heard that. [[15137 旁白 neutral]]
That was Xiaocheng's favorite drink, and she also liked it with a lot of extra sugar. [[15138 旁白 sad]]
She pressed her lips together and didn't say anything, but as she stood up, Dawang, who had been commanding his little followers, seemed to sense something. [[15139 旁白 neutral]]
With a "meow," he ran over excitedly. [[15140 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao thought Dawang was coming to her. [[15141 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she opened her arms, Dawang dodged her and tried to jump straight into Cheng Cheng's lap. [[15142 旁白 neutral]]
But unexpectedly, Cheng Cheng pinched Dawang's face. "Hey, get lost, you stupid cat! I hate tabby cats the most!" [[15143 程程 angry]]
"Um... Senpai, my Dawang has quite a temper. If you say that..." [[15144 苏桃 neutral]]
As she finished speaking, she expected Dawang to get angry, but he just happily snuggled up to Cheng Cheng. [[15145 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao watched them play, her mouth slightly open. In the end, she turned silently to order the coffee. [[15146 旁白 neutral]]
When she returned, Dawang was already curled up on Cheng Cheng's lap. [[15147 旁白 neutral]]
The girl was playing on her phone, and it was unclear who she was chatting with. [[15148 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao said slowly, "Honestly, Senpai, you're not what I expected." [[15149 苏桃 neutral]]
Taking the coffee from Su Tao, Cheng Cheng rolled her eyes at her. "Are you being polite? Are you about to comment on my height?" [[15150 程程 angry]]
"No, no." Su Tao shook her head with a light laugh. "I imagined my senpai would be more energetic, and I thought you'd be a girl around my height." [[15151 苏桃 happy]]
Who would have thought that the good friend she had been chatting with online for so long was actually a small loli. [[15152 旁白 neutral]]
She looked to be about 156 cm? [[15153 旁白 neutral]]
She was somewhere between a loli and a young girl, a little taller than Xiaocheng. [[15154 旁白 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng didn't mind Su Tao's comment and said lightly, "I didn't have enough to eat when I was little, so I didn't grow tall. But you, Taozi, surprised me a little." [[15155 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao made a rare joke, "Surprised that I'm so pretty?" [[15156 苏桃 happy]]
"Surprised that you seem to be in good spirits." Cheng Cheng reached out and stroked Dawang. "I thought you'd be in a worse mental state. I even prepared a lot of comforting words for you." [[15157 程程 neutral]]
"I'm... actually doing okay now." Su Tao took out her phone. When the screen lit up, the wallpaper was a cute picture of Xiaocheng sleeping in bed. [[15158 苏桃 sad]]
A nostalgic smile touched her lips. "I've just gotten used to being alone, to the empty feeling in my heart." [[15159 苏桃 sad]]
The two of them were already online friends who got along well. Now, after meeting in person, Su Tao felt the weight of the word "soulmate" even more in their conversation. [[15160 旁白 neutral]]
Many of the topics Cheng Cheng discussed were exactly to her taste, and she liked many of the same things. [[15161 旁白 neutral]]
Their similarities were almost endless; such a wonderful fate truly existed in the world. [[15162 旁白 happy]]
But as the conversation neared its end, Su Tao said with a hint of melancholy, "Senpai, you're a really comforting friend, but there's still something I find hard to accept." [[15163 苏桃 sad]]
Cheng Cheng looked over curiously. "What is it that you can't accept?" [[15164 程程 neutral]]
"To be honest, Cheng Cheng, you and Xiaocheng are a bit too similar." Su Tao looked at Cheng Cheng. "Same height, a slight resemblance in appearance, some shared interests, and you're both loved by Dawang. You might not be happy to hear me say this." [[15165 苏桃 sad]]
"But I really feel like you were sent by fate." [[15166 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng left me, and then you came into my life." [[15167 苏桃 sad]]
"With a slight resemblance to Xiaocheng, as if you're here to replace her, to push her away from my side." [[15168 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao pressed her lips together. "That's why it's a little hard to accept." [[15169 苏桃 sad]]
Cheng Cheng raised her eyebrows curiously and asked casually, "So what do you really think? About me, and about your Xiaocheng who has already left." [[15170 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao shook her head lightly. "Didn't I say it? I can't accept that fate let me meet you at this time." [[15171 苏桃 sad]]
"It has already taken Xiaocheng away, and now it wants to take away her existence, to take away my memories of her." [[15172 苏桃 sad]]
"Even if you two have a slight resemblance, no one can replace Xiaocheng in my heart." [[15173 苏桃 sad]]
In the end, it was just a small resemblance. [[15174 旁白 sad]]
However, such a resemblance couldn't heal the pain in her heart; it only made her want to reminisce about that girl even more. [[15175 旁白 sad]]
After listening, Cheng Cheng turned her head away when Su Tao wasn't looking and smiled faintly. "Don't worry, maybe your Xiaocheng will come back one day. She would be very happy to hear you say that." [[15176 程程 happy]]
Su Tao shook her head with a bitter smile. "How could she possibly come back?" [[15177 苏桃 sad]]
She's already dead. [[15178 旁白 sad]]
However, this online friend she had just met for the first time looked at her with great seriousness and said with a confident tone, "Taozi, you have to believe that miracles can happen. If life has no hope, what is there to look forward to?" [[15179 程程 happy]]
If I say she'll come back, she will definitely come back. [[15180 程程 neutral]]
