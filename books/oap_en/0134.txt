Chapter 134: Chen Qian, Go Get Rid of Chi Xiaocheng! [[11785 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, in another hospital, Ye Liang stared at the man and woman before him, his face dark with an anger that was impossible to hide. [[11786 旁白 neutral]]
"You're telling me you sent so many people, even opened fire, and you still haven't killed Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng?!" [[11787 叶良 angry]]
His face was extremely pale. The anger affected his injuries, and he started coughing badly. [[11788 旁白 neutral]]
With his face twisted in anger, he looked even more terrifying. [[11789 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya stood to the side, looking wronged. She said weakly, "It's not my fault. I followed your instructions and used all the money to hire those people. I didn't even know they had guns." [[11790 林芳雅 sad]]
"Besides, Su Tao is just too lucky! When the bridge suddenly collapsed, I thought they were done for. Who knew she could actually make the car fly across such a long distance!" [[11791 林芳雅 angry]]
"Brother Ye Liang, don't be angry~" [[11792 林芳雅 happy]]
She reached out to grab Ye Liang's arm, her voice intentionally sweet. [[11793 旁白 neutral]]
However, Ye Liang wasn't falling for it and slapped her hand away. [[11794 旁白 neutral]]
His face darkened as he suddenly looked at Xiao Ming, who was standing to the side. "What about you? The fake marriage certificate I gave you was useless. Don't you call yourself the Dragon King? Is this all you've got after coming back from abroad? You can't even handle a single Su Tao?!" [[11795 叶良 angry]]
Xiao Ming crossed his arms and snorted, "Ye Liang, we have a deal, but don't take your anger out on me. You were the one who said the fake marriage certificate would definitely control Su Tao. But it turns out that useless piece of paper is less important than someone named Chi Xiaocheng." [[11796 萧鸣 angry]]
"Chi Xiaocheng again..." Ye Liang clenched his fists, burning with rage, and yelled at Xiao Ming, "Aren't you the Dragon King? You said you're a great fighter with lots of followers. If the marriage certificate didn't work, why didn't you just take Su Tao by force?!" [[11797 叶良 angry]]
"The three-year period is not over yet. I must remain patient." [[11798 萧鸣 neutral]]
Ye Liang forced a smile, suppressing his anger. "So when does your three-year period end?" [[11799 叶良 angry]]
Xiao Ming rubbed his nose. "I just got back to the country. There are still two years and 347 days left." [[11800 萧鸣 neutral]]
Ye Liang: "?" [[11801 叶良 angry]]
"Xiao Ming, you son of a &%#..." [[11802 叶良 angry]]
"Brother Ye Liang, don't be angry. You've only just recovered a little. Getting angry will be bad for your health." [[11803 林芳雅 sad]]
"Doctor! Doctor, come quickly!" [[11804 林芳雅 sad]]
After some emergency treatment, Ye Liang was stabilized again. [[11805 旁白 neutral]]
His face was pale, and he looked like he could die at any moment. [[11806 旁白 neutral]]
But Ye Liang couldn't be entirely blamed for this. If he had only targeted Chi Xiaocheng, he might have succeeded and even forced out her substitute scarecrow. [[11807 旁白 neutral]]
But after his complete fallout with Su Tao in the snow and getting kicked in the groin by Chi Song, any feelings of possession or liking he had for Su Tao completely disappeared. [[11808 旁白 neutral]]
Only hatred remained! [[11809 旁白 neutral]]
As his devoted follower, Lin Fangya was easily used by him. But what shocked Ye Liang even more was meeting Xiao Ming, who had returned from abroad! [[11810 旁白 neutral]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng started causing trouble, he had been pursuing Su Tao for several months. Although they had never even held hands, let alone gotten together, Su Tao's personality led her to tell him about the jade pendant. [[11811 旁白 neutral]]
When he saw Xiao Ming's jade pendant, Ye Liang immediately connected with him. [[11812 旁白 neutral]]
The Dragon King had returned from abroad! [[11813 旁白 neutral]]
He was a master of martial arts! [[11814 旁白 neutral]]
He had countless underworld followers! [[11815 旁白 neutral]]
Wow, this was the exact expert he desperately needed. Although his influence covered Jiuzhou City, the pressure from the Ye family in Jingcheng and his defeat in Lizhi City left him with no spare resources. [[11816 旁白 neutral]]
This Xiao Ming had arrived at the perfect time! [[11817 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang immediately swore an oath of brotherhood with him. [[11818 旁白 neutral]]
He originally wanted Xiao Ming to help kill Su Tao, but he didn't expect him to be captivated by her beauty the moment they met. [[11819 旁白 neutral]]
After asking, he learned that Xiao Ming had found the jade pendant on a mercenary battlefield abroad. [[11820 旁白 neutral]]
The key was that as he investigated the pendant, he was shocked to discover its significant origin. [[11821 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, who he thought was an orphan, actually had a War God father abroad! [[11822 旁白 neutral]]
He wasn't sure about the War God father's situation, but the power he held made his scalp tingle. [[11823 旁白 neutral]]
If that man returned, he would be completely unable to resist him. [[11824 旁白 neutral]]
If he could control the entire Ye family in Jingcheng, then even the War God father would have to show him some respect. [[11825 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng, this butterfly, had already messed up the entire plotline. In the original story, Ye Liang relied on Su Tao's main character aura to control the entire Ye family, which allowed him to later compete with the War God father. [[11826 旁白 neutral]]
But now, he was still in the hospital, unable to even protect himself. [[11827 旁白 neutral]]
This was why Ye Liang was so anxious and was willing to use any means necessary to get rid of Su Tao as well. [[11828 旁白 neutral]]
But now, you're telling me? [[11829 旁白 neutral]]
The people hired with so much money couldn't get rid of Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao! [[11830 旁白 neutral]]
This Xiao Ming claims to be some amazing Dragon King, but when I ask you to act, you tell me you have to be patient? [[11831 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang really wanted to curse this big idiot Xiao Ming out. [[11832 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya didn't dare to say much. She watched Ye Liang's expression carefully and waited until he had calmed down a bit before saying softly, "Ye Liang, why don't we target someone close to Su Tao?" [[11833 林芳雅 neutral]]
Ye Liang frowned at her. "Someone close to her?" [[11834 叶良 neutral]]
Neither Si Chen nor Dongfang Yang would ever be on his side. [[11835 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya nodded. "I've investigated Su Tao. She has a roommate named Chen Qian, who was your high school classmate. It seems she's liked you for a long time. I think a devoted follower like her could be useful." [[11836 林芳雅 neutral]]
"Chen Qian?" [[11837 叶良 neutral]]
Ye Liang frowned for a moment before remembering. Chen Qian had given him many love letters in high school and was a ruthless person. Many women who got close to him were dealt with by her. [[11838 旁白 neutral]]
Although he looked down on such a materialistic woman, but now... [[11839 旁白 neutral]]
A person like that would probably come crawling over like a dog with just a snap of his fingers, right? [[11840 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya said softly, "We could totally bribe Chen Qian to poison Su Tao's food!" [[11841 林芳雅 happy]]
Ye Liang's eyes lit up. "Great idea! You're a genius!" [[11842 叶良 happy]]
Now, he needed to turn an enemy soldier immediately! [[11843 旁白 neutral]]
As he was thinking about Chen Qian, she was also worrying in her dorm room. [[11844 旁白 neutral]]
How could she get close to Ye Liang? [[11845 陈倩 neutral]]
She played with a very tempting apple in her hand and marveled, "It's amazing how this apple hasn't rotted after several days." [[11846 陈倩 neutral]]
A few days ago, Chi Xiaocheng had sent her the antidote. Besides the antidote, there was also a magical black technology that eliminated fat. She checked and confirmed that she had really lost a full ten kilograms! [[11847 旁白 neutral]]
Getting rid of the useless fat made her figure look countless times better. [[11848 旁白 neutral]]
She had the antidote, which meant Chi Xiaocheng completely trusted her. [[11849 旁白 neutral]]
And her first mission after gaining that trust was to find a way to give this apple to Ye Liang and watch him eat it. [[11850 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian could guess that this apple was not a good thing and might be dangerous. [[11851 旁白 neutral]]
But. [[11852 旁白 neutral]]
No risk, no reward! [[11853 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't resist the temptation of becoming a national goddess step by step. [[11854 旁白 neutral]]
Just a month ago, she was an ordinary-looking girl with a face full of pimples and blackheads. [[11855 旁白 neutral]]
Now, even when she went out without makeup, many boys would ask for her WeChat. [[11856 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe she should do what she did before: visit him in the hospital as a admirer and feed him the apple? [[11857 旁白 neutral]]
As she was worrying, Chen Qian suddenly received a familiar phone call. [[11858 旁白 neutral]]
"Ye Liang?" [[11859 陈倩 happy]]
"Huh? You want me to be your undercover agent?" [[11860 陈倩 happy]]
"You'll give me one million?!" [[11861 陈倩 happy]]
Chen Qian looked at the red apple in her hand, her expression turning strange. [[11862 陈倩 neutral]]
