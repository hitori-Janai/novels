Chapter 123: Death is Knocking (Bonus Chapter) [[10851 旁白 neutral]]
After punching herself, Su Tao wiped the bright red blood from her nose and calmed down a bit. [[10852 苏桃 sad]]
She forced herself not to look at Chi Xiaocheng, afraid she would lose control of her emotions again. [[10853 苏桃 sad]]
First, she called Dongfang Yang, and then she called Si Chen. Finally, she remembered to call 120 for an ambulance. [[10854 苏桃 neutral]]
The three parties reacted differently. [[10855 旁白 neutral]]
When Dongfang Yang heard that Chi Xiaocheng's life was in danger, he took a sharp breath and said only two words: "Wait for me." [[10856 东方阳 sad]]
Si Chen seemed prepared. He just said "Mm" and immediately stated he would send medical staff over. [[10857 司辰 neutral]]
Finally, the 120 emergency operator asked about Chi Xiaocheng's condition. They then taught Su Tao how to stop the bleeding and gave her many important instructions. [[10858 旁白 neutral]]
The operator also continued to calm Su Tao's emotions. [[10859 旁白 neutral]]
After using the first-aid kit to stop the bleeding, Su Tao collapsed helplessly in front of the bathtub. [[10860 苏桃 sad]]
Looking at Chi Xiaocheng soaking in the cold water, she didn't dare to move her body, afraid of causing any accidents. [[10861 苏桃 sad]]
She kept one of her hands in the water, feeling the biting cold, as if she could give Chi Xiaocheng a little warmth. [[10862 苏桃 sad]]
Endless guilt, regret, and pain flooded her heart. [[10863 旁白 sad]]
Her eyes were red, and it seemed her tears were about to run dry. [[10864 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao had so much to say to Chi Xiaocheng, but her throat was choked up, and she couldn't speak. [[10865 苏桃 sad]]
The girl in the bathtub could no longer hear her words. [[10866 旁白 sad]]
The only thing Su Tao was thankful for was that... [[10867 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was still alive. [[10868 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't truly left her. [[10869 旁白 neutral]]
Almost every minute, Su Tao would put her hand in front of Chi Xiaocheng's nose to check if her weak breathing was still there. [[10870 苏桃 sad]]
She felt that time was passing so slowly. [[10871 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey Xiaocheng, your love... it scares me." [[10872 苏桃 sad]]
Her good behavior for the past half-month was actually a deeper love, a rebound after her yandere nature had been quiet. Her strange gentleness was like a powder keg. [[10873 旁白 neutral]]
The one who lit the fuse wasn't Ye Liang, nor was it some outsider who liked her. [[10874 旁白 neutral]]
It was me! [[10875 苏桃 sad]]
"Xiaocheng, please wake up, okay? I... I won't say those things again. Even if you want us to be a couple, I won't refuse you like that anymore. I'll listen to you. You have to hold on, you have to wake up, okay?" [[10876 苏桃 sad]]
News from family, the father's love she longed for. [[10877 旁白 sad]]
Now, her true family was slipping away from her, bit by bit! [[10878 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao took out her phone again to check the time. [[10879 苏桃 sad]]
Ten minutes had passed. She could faintly hear the sound of an ambulance from the road. [[10880 旁白 neutral]]
Finally... it's almost here. [[10881 苏桃 sad]]
A smile of relief appeared on Su Tao's pale face. "Xiaocheng, just wait a little longer. Everything will be okay. The ambulance is here, the doctors are coming. Don't worry, I'll be with you." [[10882 苏桃 happy]]
"You said it at the hospital last time, right? You wanted to see me as soon as you woke up, right?" [[10883 苏桃 happy]]
"You love me that much, don't you? This time, when you wake up, you'll see me too. You'll also hear me say 'I love you.' So for that, to be a couple with me, you have to hold on, you know?" [[10884 苏桃 happy]]
Even if... even if being a couple was just her wishful thinking, her twisted and sick love, Su Tao didn't dare to say no again. [[10885 旁白 sad]]
Pretending to love her would be fine. [[10886 旁白 sad]]
Pretending to be her girlfriend to comfort her didn't matter. [[10887 旁白 sad]]
Even if she wanted to get married in the future, as long as she wouldn't be so extreme, as long as she wouldn't be a yandere. [[10888 旁白 sad]]
Pretending for a lifetime would be okay. [[10889 旁白 sad]]
If I stay with her like I did for the past half-month, and care for her more in every way, she will stay obedient and not become a yandere, right? [[10890 苏桃 sad]]
That's right. Since I'm afraid of her sick and heavy love, I should just accept her normal self. [[10891 苏桃 sad]]
Then, even if I'm tied to her side forever, it doesn't matter. The important thing is that she's okay. [[10892 苏桃 sad]]
So, please hold on, okay? [[10893 苏桃 sad]]
In the midst of despair, there was still a glimmer of light. [[10894 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of the ambulance grew louder, and it seemed to have stopped outside the neighborhood. [[10895 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao relaxed a lot and reached out again to put her hand in front of Chi Xiaocheng's nose. [[10896 苏桃 neutral]]
1 second... [[10897 旁白 neutral]]
2 seconds... [[10898 旁白 neutral]]
5 seconds... [[10899 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's pupils shrank, and her fingertips trembled uncontrollably. [[10900 旁白 sad]]
"Hey... this is a joke, right?" [[10901 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's voice trembled too, and a touch of fear and despair grew in her tone. [[10902 旁白 sad]]
She kept waiting. [[10903 旁白 sad]]
Ten seconds passed, and she still couldn't feel the weak breath from before. [[10904 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao's shoulders trembled, and she sat down weakly in the red puddle on the floor. [[10905 旁白 sad]]
Looking up at the flickering light, she let out a broken laugh, "Heh... ha... hahahaha...!" [[10906 苏桃 sad]]
"God, what are you trying to do!" [[10907 苏桃 angry]]
"The doctors... the doctors are almost here!" [[10908 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao slammed her fist on the floor. It was unclear if she was crying or laughing, her voice cracking, "Why... why take her away... at the very last moment..." [[10909 苏桃 sad]]
First giving her hope, then bringing her despair. [[10910 旁白 sad]]
No, maybe there was never any hope. [[10911 旁白 sad]]
From the moment she entered, all she felt was despair. [[10912 旁白 sad]]
Her crying gradually quieted down. [[10913 旁白 sad]]
The constant ups and downs, along with the endless regret and guilt in her heart, had left her with no strength to cry. [[10914 旁白 sad]]
She collapsed on the floor, her cheeks stained red. What fell were not just tears, but tears of blood. [[10915 旁白 sad]]
"Ding-dong~ ding-dong~" [[10916 旁白 neutral]]
The doorbell rang, like a joke from heaven. [[10917 旁白 sad]]
The ringing was urgent and continuous. [[10918 旁白 neutral]]
But... was there any point now? [[10919 苏桃 sad]]
Like a walking corpse, Su Tao stood up numbly. She was soaked in red from the overflowing bathtub water, and she walked out with heavy steps. [[10920 旁白 sad]]
The sound of the doorbell was like Death knocking at the door. [[10921 旁白 sad]]
Shouting at her to open the door quickly. [[10922 旁白 neutral]]
Your beloved Xiaocheng is heartbroken because of your rejection and betrayal. [[10923 旁白 sad]]
And Death was here to take this poor little thing away. [[10924 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao reached the entrance and struggled to open the door. [[10925 苏桃 sad]]
The bright light from outside stung her eyes. [[10926 旁白 neutral]]
Even though Si Chen was prepared, Dongfang Yang was the fastest to arrive. [[10927 旁白 neutral]]
Behind him were many doctors and nurses carrying equipment, clearly prepared for the worst-case scenario and on-site emergency treatment. [[10928 旁白 neutral]]
Ah, it wasn't Death that came, but angels in white. [[10929 旁白 sad]]
That's even more ironic, isn't it? [[10930 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao stepped aside and pointed to a corner, "In the bathroom." [[10931 苏桃 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao's empty eyes, as if her soul had left her, Dongfang Yang's breath caught in his throat. [[10932 旁白 sad]]
Fighting back a bad feeling, Dongfang Yang asked, "What happened to Chi Xiaocheng?" [[10933 东方阳 sad]]
Su Tao grabbed Dongfang Yang's sleeve, leaving a darker handprint on his red coat. [[10934 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice was trembling and desperate, "Dongfang Yang... Xiaocheng, she... she's not breathing anymore." [[10935 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang was silent as the angels in white entered the bathroom one by one. [[10936 旁白 sad]]
As if with a final struggle, Dongfang Yang asked in a low voice, "Are you sure?" [[10937 东方阳 sad]]
But seeing Su Tao's expression, she must have been sure. [[10938 旁白 sad]]
Trying to comfort the girl's broken spirit, Dongfang Yang said, "My doctors haven't said anything yet. There's still hope. Rest for a bit. Chi Xiaocheng wouldn't want you to give up on her." [[10939 东方阳 sad]]
He pulled Su Tao to the sofa without taking no for an answer. [[10940 旁白 neutral]]
On the messy table, the sheath of a fruit knife next to a white piece of paper was particularly glaring. [[10941 旁白 neutral]]
But what was even more out of place was this clean sheet of white paper. [[10942 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang flipped the paper over and saw two elegant characters written on it. [[10943 旁白 neutral]]
--Suicide Note. [[10944 旁白 neutral]]
