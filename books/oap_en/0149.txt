Chapter 149: Breakdown [[13125 旁白 neutral]]
The dream was over, but not completely. [[13126 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's dream had ended, but her—Su Tao's—"dream" was still going on. [[13127 旁白 neutral]]
A dream called "reality." [[13128 旁白 neutral]]
When she opened her eyes, tears blurred her vision, and she was still holding the warm body in her arms. [[13129 苏桃 sad]]
The sound of breathing in her ear and the clear feeling of a heartbeat pulled at Su Tao's sanity, constantly telling her that Xiaocheng was still alive. [[13130 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang hadn't killed Chi Xiaocheng. [[13131 旁白 neutral]]
And she herself hadn't been hospitalized after having her face slashed. [[13132 旁白 neutral]]
Because of Chi Xiaocheng's extremism and yandere nature, she was able to see Ye Liang's true character early on and go their separate ways. [[13133 旁白 neutral]]
It was just a dream. [[13134 苏桃 neutral]]
Sleep, wake up, and then forget. [[13135 苏桃 neutral]]
But could she really forget? [[13136 苏桃 sad]]
The miserable image of Xiaocheng from the dream kept flashing through Su Tao's mind. [[13137 旁白 sad]]
Eating leftovers brought by stray cats and dogs, sleeping in dark corners or on park benches, too scared to sleep or make a sound in the middle of the night—the clean and cute her was getting stained with more and more "ink." [[13138 旁白 sad]]
In the end, after being recognized because of her face, she even went as far as to slash her own face with a knife. [[13139 旁白 sad]]
Without anesthesia, she heated a fruit knife with fire, bit down on a cloth strip, and just started doing it. [[13140 旁白 sad]]
Whether it was for atonement or from the pain, her tears never stopped. She would faint from the pain, wake up, and continue. [[13141 旁白 sad]]
She went from scrambling on the ground at first to barely surviving in the sewers. [[13142 旁白 sad]]
Beaten, abused, drowned. [[13143 旁白 sad]]
The world was so big, yet no one was willing to lend her a hand. [[13144 旁白 sad]]
At the end of the dream, Su Tao didn't even dare to look at such a scene; she just felt a heartache that made it hard to breathe. [[13145 旁白 sad]]
She wanted to blame the Su Tao in the dream, but she gradually realized that if it weren't for Xiaocheng's yandere nature changing her, would her own ending have been like that? [[13146 苏桃 sad]]
How was the 'her' in the dream not herself? [[13147 苏桃 sad]]
She felt too much pressure. When she zoned out, she would often wonder what the future would be like if Xiaocheng wasn't a yandere. [[13148 苏桃 sad]]
Now, she had the answer. [[13149 苏桃 neutral]]
In the first dream, Xiaocheng dreamt that Ye Liang would hurt her, and then she started to become a bit abnormal—paranoid and extreme, especially towards Ye Liang and the others. [[13150 旁白 neutral]]
At first, she found it unbelievable. Could a dream really make a person so obsessed? Was that possible? [[13151 苏桃 neutral]]
Now, she was starting to believe it. [[13152 苏桃 neutral]]
Could the dream Xiaocheng had before be just like hers? [[13153 苏桃 neutral]]
In the dream, she watched Ye Liang torture and kill her. [[13154 苏桃 sad]]
She believed it was real and wanted to change that future. [[13155 旁白 neutral]]
The gears of fate began to turn. [[13156 旁白 neutral]]
Now she had two such dreams, so real that she didn't think they were fake. [[13157 苏桃 neutral]]
She even started to wonder if this was her and Xiaocheng's future. [[13158 苏桃 sad]]
She didn't become a yandere and died all alone. [[13159 旁白 neutral]]
Now she had become a yandere, but not to the extent of having a lucid dream. But what was the final result? [[13160 旁白 neutral]]
The people around her left one by one, all killed by Chi Xiaocheng, until only Chi Xiaocheng was left in Su Tao's world. [[13161 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao was afraid of Chi Xiaocheng leaving, but she was also afraid of the latter ending. [[13162 苏桃 sad]]
As for Ye Liang, if he dies, he dies. [[13163 苏桃 angry]]
But her other friends, the people she cherished—she didn't want them to be affected. [[13164 苏桃 sad]]
Now Long Mian was the first to have something happen, and the mentor who had always wanted to guide her and cared for her had followed in Long Mian's footsteps. [[13165 旁白 sad]]
Were these two endings really destined to happen? [[13166 苏桃 sad]]
She wanted other solutions, but the suffocating pressure left her breathless and too scared to even think about it. [[13167 苏桃 sad]]
She wanted to hold Chi Xiaocheng in her arms tightly, but she didn't dare to hold her too tight. [[13168 苏桃 sad]]
The moment she closed her eyes, she saw Chi Xiaocheng being tortured and drowned in the dream. [[13169 旁白 sad]]
Whispering "Taotao" until the moment she died. [[13170 旁白 sad]]
At four in the morning, Su Tao couldn't sleep. [[13171 苏桃 sad]]
And she didn't dare to sleep. [[13172 苏桃 sad]]
She stayed awake like that until the morning. [[13173 旁白 neutral]]
She was so haggard that her expression was dazed. [[13174 旁白 neutral]]
After getting out of bed quietly, Su Tao didn't wake Chi Xiaocheng. Instead, she washed her face with ice-cold water, and the biting cold made her skin sting. [[13175 旁白 neutral]]
But it was this pain that allowed her to become clear-headed. [[13176 旁白 neutral]]
"Today is the third day." [[13177 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the calendar and only then noticed that New Year's Day had already passed. [[13178 旁白 neutral]]
It was now January 4th, a brand new year. [[13179 旁白 neutral]]
The only special thing about today was that Chi Xiaocheng had promised this "locked-room game" would only last for three days. [[13180 旁白 neutral]]
After today, would Xiaocheng let her go? [[13181 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao took out the pill Chi Xiaocheng had given her last night. [[13182 旁白 neutral]]
It was the stress-relief pill, but Su Tao didn't know this little thing could relieve stress. [[13183 旁白 neutral]]
She just thought it was something Chi Xiaocheng gave her with ulterior motives. [[13184 旁白 neutral]]
But after last night's dream, she felt some regret. [[13185 苏桃 sad]]
"Would it be better if I took this pill?" [[13186 苏桃 neutral]]
Stop resisting Xiaocheng and just let time pass. [[13187 苏桃 neutral]]
And then... [[13188 苏桃 neutral]]
"No, I can't!" [[13189 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao shook her head hard and slapped her face. "I can't give up yet. If I take this pill, there will be no chance to change anything." [[13190 苏桃 angry]]
She stood up and took a deep breath. [[13191 旁白 neutral]]
As if to encourage herself, she pounded her chest with her hand. [[13192 旁白 neutral]]
But when she looked at her hand, her pupils contracted unnaturally. [[13193 旁白 neutral]]
Her hand... was trembling. [[13194 苏桃 sad]]
Even when she gripped it tightly with her other hand, it still trembled. [[13195 旁白 neutral]]
She glanced at the television. [[13196 旁白 neutral]]
The off-screen LCD was like a mirror, clearly reflecting her haggard, deathly pale face. [[13197 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't slept well for two days. [[13198 旁白 neutral]]
Her nerves were tense every moment. [[13199 旁白 neutral]]
Even when she slept, the nightmares almost made her break down in her dreams. [[13200 旁白 sad]]
"Is there... really still a chance?" [[13201 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng's yandere nature, and Xiaocheng's heavy love... [[13202 苏桃 sad]]
Just then, Chi Xiaocheng's voice suddenly came from beside her, "Taotao, you're up so early today? How did you sleep last night?" [[13203 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng rubbed her sleepy eyes, moved closer to Su Tao, and stared at her face seriously. [[13204 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, you look so pale. Couldn't you sleep last night?" she asked with a surprised look. [[13205 池小橙 neutral]]
Those crimson vertical pupils just stared at her. [[13206 旁白 neutral]]
Their eyes met. [[13207 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a boundless fear rushing towards her. [[13208 旁白 sad]]
She blinked, and Chi Xiaocheng's cute face before her suddenly transformed into the slashed face from her dream. [[13209 旁白 sad]]
Smiling with a desperate smile. [[13210 旁白 sad]]
The last bit of courage she had mustered vanished completely. [[13211 旁白 sad]]
She seemed to hear Chi Xiaocheng's resentful voice in her ear, "Taotao... why didn't you save me? I love you, why didn't you save me!" [[13212 池小橙 sad]]
In an instant, the slashed face became normal again, but it was stained with bright red orange juice, and the smile on her lips was morbidly twisted. [[13213 旁白 sad]]
"Hey Taotao~ Everyone is sleeping quietly now. No one can disturb our world for two anymore. You're happy that we can be together forever like this, right?" [[13214 池小橙 happy]]
Although that cute face was so lovely, in Su Tao's eyes, it seemed as if the Xiaochengs from both dreams were occupying that face. [[13215 旁白 neutral]]
Until Chi Xiaocheng asked again, "Taotao, what are you spacing out for? How about a cup of hot water?" [[13216 池小橙 neutral]]
After speaking, Chi Xiaocheng headed for the kitchen. [[13217 旁白 neutral]]
But in Su Tao's ears, this sentence sounded completely different. [[13218 旁白 neutral]]
—What are you spacing out for? [[13219 旁白 neutral]]
—Do you not like me anymore? [[13220 旁白 neutral]]
Mentally exhausted and terrified, she was starting to have auditory hallucinations. [[13221 旁白 sad]]
Her pupils struggled as she looked at Chi Xiaocheng in disbelief and slowly asked, "Xiaocheng, how can you hurt yourself with such a calm face and say you like me? I told you before, right?" [[13222 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but turn her head, "Told me what?" [[13223 池小橙 neutral]]
The girl suddenly shouted, "I told you I can't accept your heavy and twisted love!" [[13224 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao, had snapped. [[13225 旁白 neutral]]
