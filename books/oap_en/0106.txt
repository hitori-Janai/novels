Chapter 106: Xiaocheng is Well-Behaved [[9184 旁白 neutral]]
The dependence Chi Xiaocheng had shown all this time was just a product of the pressure from her 'darkening,' aided by her intermediate acting skills. [[9185 旁白 neutral]]
She had never wondered, if she stopped being a yandere, would Tao Tao still care for her as much as before? [[9186 池小橙 sad]]
Staying by her side. [[9187 池小橙 neutral]]
Living together, cuddling, working hard together, using this small house as a secret base for their relationship to grow, and then getting a kitten as a pet... wouldn't it all be so wonderful? [[9188 池小橙 happy]]
If only a wish like that could come true. [[9189 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought that maybe it was okay not to pressure Su Tao by acting like a yandere. [[9190 池小橙 neutral]]
She didn't need the process, but the result. [[9191 池小橙 neutral]]
So. [[9192 池小橙 neutral]]
I'll be good, I won't have an 'episode,' I won't bother Tao Tao often, I'll listen to you, and be like a little kitten for you to spoil. [[9193 池小橙 happy]]
As long as you don't leave my side, as long as you don't go to someone else. [[9194 池小橙 sad]]
Love can be so humble. [[9195 旁白 sad]]
But her possessiveness was not any less. [[9196 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps it was a contradiction, but Chi Xiaocheng eagerly awaited Su Tao's answer to her request. [[9197 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to be 'saved' this way, not by wearing the mask of a 'yandere'. [[9198 旁白 sad]]
"Of course, you can." [[9199 苏桃 happy]]
The words came from Su Tao's mouth, full of affection. [[9200 旁白 happy]]
It was like moonlight shining down on Chi Xiaocheng in the darkness. [[9201 旁白 happy]]
She stroked her head gently and slowly, "I've always liked the well-behaved Xiaocheng." [[9202 苏桃 happy]]
The petite girl nuzzled her head, slipped out of Su Tao's embrace, and lifted her beautiful red eyes. She carefully parted her pink lips, "Really?" [[9203 池小橙 happy]]
Her small face was so close. The sudden appearance of this cute girl made Su Tao pause for a moment. She smiled, "Really." [[9204 苏桃 happy]]
"Then, pinky promise." [[9205 池小橙 happy]]
She held out her little finger, her words as innocent as her appearance. [[9206 旁白 neutral]]
"Okay, pinky promise~" [[9207 苏桃 happy]]
Their two slender little fingers hooked together. [[9208 旁白 neutral]]
"Pinky promise, seal it with a kiss, a hundred years, no takebacks." [[9209 池小橙 happy]]
They looked at each other and both laughed happily. [[9210 旁白 happy]]
It's very childish, isn't it? [[9211 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao rather enjoyed this childishness; it always reminded her of the past. [[9212 旁白 happy]]
Having gotten a promise and affirmation, Chi Xiaocheng smiled happily, "Tao Tao, close your eyes." [[9213 池小橙 happy]]
"What is it?" [[9214 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't know why, but she still closed her eyes. [[9215 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng whispered in her ear, "It's a gift for me starting to be good and obedient~" [[9216 池小橙 happy]]
"Mwah~" [[9217 旁白 neutral]]
Like a dragonfly skimming the water, the touch was there and gone in an instant. [[9218 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng seemed to shyly dive back under the covers. [[9219 旁白 neutral]]
Leaving only a moist spot on the side of her cheek. [[9220 旁白 neutral]]
Even though they had tried more intense things, just a print on her cheek now gave Su Tao a completely different feeling. [[9221 旁白 happy]]
No, a kiss on the cheek. [[9222 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like this was the first time. [[9223 旁白 happy]]
A sweet feeling arose in her heart. Su Tao reached out, turned off the light, and said softly to the person in the covers, "Okay, it's very late. Let's sleep. You won't have nightmares with me here." [[9224 苏桃 happy]]
"Mmm~" [[9225 池小橙 happy]]
They fell asleep in each other's arms, sleeping soundly until morning. [[9226 旁白 happy]]
Because she had left in a hurry in the middle of the night, Su Tao didn't bring her scent pouch, but tonight she slept especially soundly. [[9227 旁白 happy]]
The scent of the pouch seemed to linger by her nose, bringing a sense of peace. [[9228 旁白 happy]]
When she woke up, Su Tao found that she was no longer holding a small body, but a big, fluffy brown bear. [[9229 旁白 neutral]]
"Has Xiaocheng already gotten up?" [[9230 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao sat up, rubbing her sleepy eyes, and patted the big brown bear, "You're really not as soft as Xiaocheng." [[9231 苏桃 happy]]
She sniffed the air lightly. [[9232 旁白 neutral]]
Besides the lingering fragrance of Chi Xiaocheng, there was also the faint smell of porridge. [[9233 旁白 neutral]]
"Is Xiaocheng making breakfast?" [[9234 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao remembered clearly that Chi Xiaocheng couldn't cook. [[9235 旁白 neutral]]
After several failed attempts at making rice and stir-fries, where she was defeated by the rice cooker and spatula, Su Tao had forbidden her from touching them. [[9236 旁白 neutral]]
She walked out of the room, and it was still warm. [[9237 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed the air conditioner in the living room had been on for a while. [[9238 旁白 neutral]]
The smell of porridge was coming from the kitchen. Chi Xiaocheng was indeed making porridge. [[9239 旁白 neutral]]
But what made Su Tao not know whether to laugh or cry was that there were several new takeout boxes in the trash can. [[9240 旁白 neutral]]
Peeking into the kitchen, she saw Chi Xiaocheng standing on a small stool, cooking porridge like she knew what she was doing. [[9241 旁白 neutral]]
As if sensing her, Chi Xiaocheng turned around and smiled, "Tao Tao, you're up! I made breakfast. Come and try my cooking!" [[9242 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao said meaningfully, "Really? But I saw takeout boxes outside." [[9243 苏桃 neutral]]
What 'making breakfast'. [[9244 旁白 neutral]]
It was clearly just reheating takeout in a pot. [[9245 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng blushed shyly, "I wanted to make it for you with my own hands, but I don't know how. Even though this is from takeout, it still passed through my hands, right?" [[9246 池小橙 happy]]
"You're unbelievable. Reheating it might just make it taste worse." [[9247 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao's voice was helpless, but she was very happy. [[9248 旁白 happy]]
This side of Chi Xiaocheng was very rare; she really liked this well-behaved version, separate from the yandere. [[9249 旁白 happy]]
And Chi Xiaocheng was playing the part of this well-behaved girl, just as Su Tao liked. [[9250 旁白 neutral]]
Growing up alone in her past life, how could she not know how to cook? It was just for her. [[9251 旁白 neutral]]
It was better to be obedient. [[9252 旁白 neutral]]
Because she likes me this way. [[9253 旁白 sad]]
Because this way, she won't leave me. [[9254 旁白 sad]]
But the moment Su Tao turned away, the smile on Chi Xiaocheng's face froze, and her pupils constricted. [[9255 旁白 angry]]
It was a look of extreme shock and fear. [[9256 旁白 angry]]
In her vision, a pitch-black 'Xiaocheng' appeared out of thin air, leaning against the kitchen wall. [[9257 旁白 angry]]
She spoke softly, "This obedient girl you're pretending to be isn't the real you at all. Is there any point in making her like this version of you?" [[9258 旁白 angry]]
Her deeply hidden insecurities were being dug up. [[9259 旁白 angry]]
It made her blood run cold. [[9260 旁白 angry]]
Just then, Su Tao suddenly turned back, "By the way, Xiaocheng, how about I teach you how to cook next time? Eating takeout all the time isn't good for you." [[9261 苏桃 happy]]
The pitch-black Xiaocheng that had been leaning against the wall vanished. [[9262 旁白 neutral]]
The voice in her ear also stopped abruptly. [[9263 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao seemed to sense that something was wrong with Chi Xiaocheng and asked with concern, "Xiaocheng?" [[9264 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng quickly came back to her senses, nodded, and smiled, "Okay." [[9265 池小橙 happy]]
Under the cover of her intermediate acting skills, everything seemed normal. [[9266 旁白 neutral]]
Only after Su Tao left did Chi Xiaocheng ask uneasily in her mind, "System, did you hear any voices just now?" [[9267 池小橙 sad]]
[Were there any other sounds besides the host's and the female lead Su Tao's?] [[9268 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened her mouth but didn't answer. [[9269 旁白 sad]]
Visual and auditory hallucinations? [[9270 旁白 sad]]
Was it her own inner demon, unconsciously affecting her? [[9271 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng shook her head, trying not to think about it, and walked out with the porridge. [[9272 旁白 neutral]]
After Su Tao finished washing up, the two sat down at the dining table together. [[9273 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked her eyes, "Tao Tao, how do you want to eat?" [[9274 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao took out a hair tie, pulled her gray-black hair into a ponytail, and chuckled, "How else do you eat porridge?" [[9275 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng gave her two options. [[9276 旁白 neutral]]
"One is, you eat it yourself." [[9277 池小橙 happy]]
"The other one is~" Chi Xiaocheng drew out her words, pressing a finger to her delicate pink lips, "I feed you." [[9278 池小橙 happy]]
As for how she would feed her, Chi Xiaocheng didn't need to say. [[9279 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao already knew. [[9280 旁白 neutral]]
During their time in the dark room, her only source of taste had been Chi Xiaocheng's 'feeding'. [[9281 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the obedient Chi Xiaocheng and couldn't help but think, the current Xiaocheng shows no signs of an episode, so it's okay to refuse, right? [[9282 旁白 neutral]]
She said as gently as possible, "Let's just eat normally." [[9283 苏桃 happy]]
"Okay~" [[9284 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded lightly, without any other reaction. [[9285 旁白 neutral]]
Still just one word. [[9286 旁白 neutral]]
Obedient. [[9287 旁白 neutral]]
As long as I'm good, Tao Tao won't leave. [[9288 池小橙 sad]]
She added in her heart. [[9289 旁白 sad]]
But then she noticed that the hallucination that had disappeared earlier, the Xiaocheng radiating a dark aura, had reappeared at some point. [[9290 旁白 angry]]
She was sitting on the edge of the sofa with her legs crossed and her chin in her hand, watching the scene with an amused expression. [[9291 旁白 angry]]
