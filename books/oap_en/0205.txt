Chapter 205: Xiaocheng's Resurrection Countdown [[17941 旁白 neutral]]
What a rational man, always pretending to be so deep in thought. [[17942 池小橙 angry]]
That old man should have given me Emotion Points long ago. [[17943 池小橙 angry]]
Late at night after being brought home by Su Tao, Chi Xiaocheng listened to the continuous system notifications in her mind. Her anxiety faded, and she felt much more relieved. [[17944 旁白 neutral]]
Although she had used a lot of Emotion Points on the illusion skill along the way, Chu Lingfeng had provided a good amount. [[17945 旁白 neutral]]
Adding the points from Si Chen, who couldn't sleep because of her note, Chi Xiaocheng now had 1,400 Emotion Points. [[17946 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng was a new character, and Si Chen didn't usually show much emotion, so he was practically brand new. [[17947 旁白 neutral]]
The amount of points they provided at the beginning was quite substantial. [[17948 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng felt that she could definitely save up 3,000 Emotion Points to exchange for a poison apple before she woke up. [[17949 旁白 neutral]]
Even as a scarecrow, she couldn't just stay at home doing nothing during the day when Su Tao went out. [[17950 旁白 neutral]]
She needed to go out, hide her condition, and get close to the named characters from the original novel to gain Emotion Points. [[17951 旁白 neutral]]
But before that, she needed a mode of transportation. [[17952 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng searched through the System's shop and quickly found what she was looking for. [[17953 旁白 neutral]]
[Animal Communication Pill: A box with two pills. The host eats one, and gives the other to an animal. Then they can talk to each other, and both sides will understand. But please be cautious about giving it to animals with very low intelligence, as they might not be able to communicate properly even after eating it.] [[17954 系统 neutral]]
[Price: 2000 Emotion Points] [[17955 系统 neutral]]
"So expensive!" [[17956 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was shocked, but considering it was a permanent item that would bind them together forever, the high price made some sense. [[17957 旁白 neutral]]
But buying this was clearly not an option. [[17958 旁白 neutral]]
First, it was too expensive; she didn't have that many Emotion Points. [[17959 旁白 neutral]]
Second, Da Wang was a stupid cat, clearly not very intelligent. The description specifically warned against giving it to animals with low intelligence. [[17960 旁白 neutral]]
Third, she was a scarecrow and couldn't take pills. [[17961 旁白 neutral]]
So, she had to settle for second best. [[17962 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng quickly found a substitute. [[17963 旁白 neutral]]
A Virtual Perception Pill for 400 Emotion Points. It had a similar effect, but the master was fixed as her, the host. After Da Wang ate it, they would be directly linked, but the effect would be weaker. [[17964 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng still wouldn't be able to understand what Da Wang was saying, but Da Wang would be able to intuitively understand the meaning of her words. [[17965 旁白 neutral]]
That's right, it wouldn't understand her words directly. [[17966 旁白 neutral]]
But rather, perceive their meaning. [[17967 旁白 neutral]]
It would be like a well-trained pet, but much more intuitive and clever. [[17968 旁白 neutral]]
The next day, while Su Tao was out working at the cafe, Chi Xiaocheng exchanged for the small pill. [[17969 旁白 neutral]]
Then, after a great battle with Da Wang, she finally managed to feed the pill into its mouth. [[17970 旁白 neutral]]
After eating the pill, Da Wang still wanted to carry Chi Xiaocheng around and run wildly. [[17971 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng wanted to test the pill's ability, so she pretended to be angry. "You stupid cat, if you keep carrying me around, believe it or not, I'll eat cat meat next time!" [[17972 池小橙 angry]]
"Meow?!" [[17973 大王 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng had said things like this before. [[17974 旁白 neutral]]
And every time, Da Wang would just carry her around as usual. [[17975 旁白 neutral]]
This time, however, Da Wang's eyes widened, and it showed a clear look of surprise. [[17976 旁白 neutral]]
Then it became obedient, brought its head close to Chi Xiaocheng's face, and rubbed its cheek against her ragdoll head. [[17977 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's current body was only the size of an adult's palm, so Da Wang was a giant to her. [[17978 旁白 neutral]]
But it was clear that Da Wang had understood her! [[17979 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng continued to test it, saying, "Sit." [[17980 池小橙 neutral]]
Da Wang obediently sat down. [[17981 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said again, "Turn left three times, then turn right once." [[17982 池小橙 neutral]]
Da Wang quickly completed the command. [[17983 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Do a backflip." [[17984 池小橙 neutral]]
This command seemed a bit difficult. After pausing for two or three seconds, Da Wang attempted a backflip, and its flexible body easily performed the action. [[17985 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Turn into a catgirl." [[17986 池小橙 neutral]]
Da Wang: "?" [[17987 大王 neutral]]
... [[17988 旁白 neutral]]
After a few tests, Chi Xiaocheng roughly understood that Da Wang could understand simple commands, but needed time to think about more complex ones. [[17989 旁白 neutral]]
When it couldn't do something, it would just stare blankly at her. It seemed this pill didn't just allow Da Wang to understand her words. [[17990 旁白 neutral]]
It had also slightly increased Da Wang's own intelligence. [[17991 旁白 neutral]]
The training was a success. Now, when Su Tao wasn't home, she wouldn't have to be so afraid of being discovered when she went out. [[17992 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng climbed onto Da Wang's back, "Let's go, it's time to head out!" [[17993 池小橙 happy]]
The mount training was complete. For the next few days, Chi Xiaocheng relied on Da Wang to familiarize herself with the surrounding areas. [[17994 旁白 neutral]]
Her main focus was the Si family residence, where Chu Lingfeng was. Besides Chu Lingfeng, there were others inside. [[17995 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen's younger brother, Si Lai; the clan elder, Si Zhenliu; and a butler over 40 years old were all named supporting characters in the original novel. [[17996 旁白 neutral]]
Taking Chen Qian as an example, her actual appearance in the original novel from beginning to end was only about ten chapters. [[17997 旁白 neutral]]
If someone like her could provide a small amount of Emotion Points, then any character with a higher weight than Chen Qian could also provide them. [[17998 旁白 neutral]]
Like Xiao Wei, who was only known as a sleepy roommate in the original story, without even a clear name. [[17999 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, she couldn't provide any Emotion Points. [[18000 旁白 neutral]]
But the three people in the Si family residence had significant roles in Si Chen's storyline. [[18001 旁白 neutral]]
Si Lai was a classic, brainless cannon fodder. In the original novel, he fell in love with Su Tao at first sight, was used as a pawn by his older brother Si Chen, and died early. [[18002 旁白 neutral]]
Si Zhenliu was an even bigger minor boss. In the original novel, he had also come into contact with Chu Lingfeng. It's unclear how he was cured, but he caused a lot of trouble for Su Tao and Si Chen. [[18003 旁白 neutral]]
The butler was a classic messenger, but he had a side quest to save his family, after which he would join Su Tao's side. [[18004 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng spent several days getting to know the residence, and then began her nightly operations. [[18005 旁白 neutral]]
She used her illusion skill to create a "haunting" panic. [[18006 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng knew it was Chi Xiaocheng coming for him again and began to provide a small amount of Emotion Points, but not as much as their first encounter. [[18007 旁白 neutral]]
The butler was annoyed by the haunting, and since his character weight wasn't high, he didn't provide many Emotion Points either. [[18008 旁白 neutral]]
The younger brother, Si Lai, provided the most Emotion Points. He got so scared he wet his pants and kept calling his brother Si Chen, saying he was afraid. [[18009 旁白 neutral]]
The emotion even transferred to Si Chen, and she gained a lot of Emotion Points from him as well. [[18010 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, she not only earned back the 400 Emotion Points for the pill but also made a profit of a full 2,000 Emotion Points! [[18011 旁白 happy]]
However, the character with the highest weight here, Si Zhenliu, was nowhere to be seen, making it difficult for Chi Xiaocheng to make a move. [[18012 旁白 neutral]]
With eight days left until her resurrection, Chi Xiaocheng found her chance and rode Da Wang to the Si residence. [[18013 旁白 neutral]]
Today was Si Zhenliu's treatment day. Chu Lingfeng would once again use the Taiyi Thirteen Needles to extend the clan elder's life. [[18014 旁白 neutral]]
But during the day, Si Zhenliu suddenly fainted. His condition dropped sharply, and his face was as pale as if he had just walked through the gates of hell. [[18015 旁白 neutral]]
Families from all over Jiuzhou City came to witness the miraculous doctor's skills. [[18016 旁白 neutral]]
Even Si Chen and Dongfang Yang were present to see just how skilled this doctor was. [[18017 旁白 neutral]]
However, no one was allowed to disturb the Taiyi Thirteen Needles procedure. [[18018 旁白 neutral]]
So, Chu Lingfeng separated everyone and found a private room to extend the clan elder's life. [[18019 旁白 neutral]]
Because of this, Chi Xiaocheng, riding Da Wang, came to the window of that room and witnessed an extremely shocking scene. [[18020 旁白 neutral]]
