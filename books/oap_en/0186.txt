Chapter 186: The Legend of the Ferris Wheel [[16237 旁白 neutral]]
After walking through the snack street near the school, visiting the Yangyang Cat Cafe, and exploring the area around the commercial city, the short day that began with the rising sun came to a close as the sunset painted the sky red. [[16238 旁白 neutral]]
It was the first time Su Tao had let her mind go blank, simply holding that small hand and letting her lead the way. [[16239 旁白 neutral]]
There was no need for intimate actions, sweet words, or spending money on unnecessary things. [[16240 旁白 neutral]]
She completely cleared her mind to enjoy this beautiful day. [[16241 旁白 happy]]
Enjoying her smile, her voice, the warmth of her hand, and the way she always met her gaze whenever she looked at her. [[16242 旁白 happy]]
This warmth and ease were the complete opposite of reality. [[16243 旁白 neutral]]
It made her feel as if... [[16244 旁白 neutral]]
A dream? [[16245 苏桃 neutral]]
No, this was probably reality. [[16246 苏桃 neutral]]
All the depressing and painful things before were just one nightmare after another. How could someone as cute and well-behaved as Xiaocheng have died? [[16247 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao walked behind Chi Xiaocheng. The little girl with light brown hair was looking down at her phone, mumbling softly, "The amusement park should be this way... Why is this map so unreliable? It's making me take a detour again!" [[16248 池小橙 angry]]
As she spoke, Chi Xiaocheng held her phone up high, turned east, and then immediately turned back to the west. [[16249 旁白 neutral]]
It looked as if she was trying to orient herself using the small triangle icon on the map. [[16250 旁白 neutral]]
She looked a little silly. [[16251 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao smiled lightly, walked over, and leaned down close to Chi Xiaocheng's face. "Let me see. There's only one amusement park around here, right? The sun is almost down, are we still going?" [[16252 苏桃 neutral]]
"But the Ferris wheel is best at night!" Chi Xiaocheng turned her head and showed the phone to Su Tao. [[16253 池小橙 happy]]
However, her gaze lingered on the profile so close to her. [[16254 旁白 neutral]]
The long eyelashes and beautiful eyes were so clear in Chi Xiaocheng's view. [[16255 旁白 neutral]]
Her skin looked so soft you could almost squeeze water from it. [[16256 旁白 neutral]]
However, Su Tao didn't notice Chi Xiaocheng's gaze and was instead looking at the map seriously. "This is the right way. Go straight, then turn, and then keep walking. Besides, it's just one road, how could you get it wrong, Xiaocheng?" [[16257 苏桃 neutral]]
"Of course, it's because..." [[16258 池小橙 happy]]
A sweet voice whispered close to Su Tao's ear. [[16259 旁白 neutral]]
She only said half of her sentence. [[16260 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a strand of hair brush against her cheek. [[16261 旁白 neutral]]
"Mwah~" [[16262 旁白 happy]]
A gentle touch on the cheek, and then it was gone. Chi Xiaocheng hugged her phone and ran ahead as if she were afraid Su Tao would get angry and chase her, turning back with a loud laugh. [[16263 旁白 happy]]
"Hahahaha, Taotao, I tricked you! Of course I know the way." [[16264 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao touched the spot on her cheek where she had been secretly kissed and smiled helplessly. [[16265 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's unfinished sentence instantly completed itself in her mind. [[16266 旁白 neutral]]
*I didn't misread the map, I just wanted a closer look at you.* [[16267 苏桃 neutral]]
*I couldn't help it because I like you, so I stole a little kiss.* [[16268 苏桃 happy]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng "fleeing in panic," Su Tao pretended to be angry and rolled up her sleeves. "Oh, so you dare to ambush me! You'll be in trouble if I catch you!" [[16269 苏桃 happy]]
"Nyah nyah, you can't catch me!" [[16270 池小橙 happy]]
Playing and teasing are a natural part of emotional exchange. [[16271 旁白 neutral]]
The amusement park wasn't far. By the time they jogged there, the already weak Chi Xiaocheng was bent over, hands on her knees, panting for breath. [[16272 旁白 neutral]]
She waved her hands in surrender. "I can't, I can't... I can't run anymore. Taotao, you exercise all the time, I can't compare to you at all!" [[16273 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao looked at her fondly. "Who told you to keep running? Can you still walk? You'll need energy to have fun at the park, you know." [[16274 苏桃 happy]]
"Then you can carry me." [[16275 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng simply opened her arms and smiled. "Or you can give me a piggyback ride. That way I won't have to walk." [[16276 池小橙 happy]]
"A princess carry, then?" [[16277 苏桃 happy]]
"Huh?!" [[16278 池小橙 happy]]
Before Chi Xiaocheng could even react, Su Tao bent down, adjusted her position, and easily scooped her up. [[16279 旁白 happy]]
"You're as light as a feather. Xiaocheng, you're too thin. You need to eat more, okay?" [[16280 苏桃 happy]]
She even bounced her lightly a couple of times, which left Chi Xiaocheng completely stunned. [[16281 旁白 neutral]]
The Taotao in this dream was so forward! [[16282 池小橙 happy]]
The gazes of passersby suddenly fell on them. Besides the occasional "wow," Chi Xiaocheng even saw the flash of a camera. [[16283 旁白 neutral]]
When she looked over, she noticed two girls covering their mouths and giving her and Su Tao a meaningful look. [[16284 旁白 neutral]]
When their eyes met, the two girls even waved a little hello. [[16285 旁白 neutral]]
With so many people watching, she had wanted to tease Su Tao and make her blush, but now she was the one feeling a bit embarrassed. [[16286 池小橙 sad]]
Hiss—this was the first time she'd been held like this with so many people watching. [[16287 池小橙 sad]]
Her ears felt a little hot. [[16288 池小橙 sad]]
Really, doesn't this girl Taotao ever feel shy? [[16289 池小橙 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng snuck a peek at Su Tao and saw that her face was also a little flustered and embarrassed. Chi Xiaocheng knew that Su Tao had to gather all her courage to be so bold. [[16290 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but let out a "pfft" of laughter. "Taotao, if you feel awkward, you don't have to. I can get down and walk slowly." [[16291 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao shook her head, her lips pressed together. "Xiaocheng is already tired. Besides, it's just a few people looking, it's nothing. This... this is also a way of showing how much I like Xiaocheng." [[16292 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed softly and struggled out of Su Tao's arms. [[16293 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out her small hand and took the girl's hand again. [[16294 旁白 happy]]
"I'm already very happy that you think that way, Taotao, but..." [[16295 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled at Su Tao, gently fiddling with her fingers. [[16296 旁白 happy]]
"Forcing yourself like this isn't what liking someone is about, you silly girl~" [[16297 池小橙 happy]]
Her fingertips gently twisted, and their hand-holding turned into intertwined fingers. [[16298 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng started walking towards the amusement park. "Let's go, the sun is almost down, we're running out of time. Let's ride the Ferris wheel and then go home!" [[16299 池小橙 happy]]
Their palms pressed together, sending an indescribable warmth through her whole body. [[16300 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao smiled brightly and nodded firmly. "Okay!" [[16301 苏桃 happy]]
Strolling hand in hand, Chi Xiaocheng unwrapped a lollipop and popped it into her mouth, mumbling, "Taotao, do you know the legend of the Ferris wheel?" [[16302 池小橙 neutral]]
Beside her, Su Tao shook her head gently. "I remember seeing it somewhere before. Something about what happens when you reach the very top?" [[16303 苏桃 neutral]]
"Hehe," Chi Xiaocheng said excitedly, holding the lollipop stick. "Legend says that if you kiss at the very top of the Ferris wheel, you will find eternal love and a happy future." [[16304 池小橙 happy]]
"And each cabin is seen as a vessel of happiness. Looking up at the Ferris wheel is like looking up at happiness within reach, and when we ride it, we'll receive the blessings of everyone below." [[16305 池小橙 happy]]
"Happiness..." [[16306 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao whispered the word and looked up at the Ferris wheel. [[16307 旁白 neutral]]
The cabins climbed higher and higher, growing smaller in her vision, with the one at the top looking as if it might disappear into the clouds. [[16308 旁白 neutral]]
The yellow glow of the setting sun shone on the clouds, showering down blessings and eternity. [[16309 旁白 happy]]
