Chapter 5: Sorry, But I Like You [[387 池小橙 neutral]]
As for Chi Xiaocheng, the person everyone was worried about, she collapsed on the entryway rug the moment she got home. [[388 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind was dizzy, and her breathing was rapid. [[389 旁白 neutral]]
This body was too weak. [[390 旁白 neutral]]
She was already a malnourished and sickly girl, and now she had just been chased. [[391 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the adrenaline faded, Chi Xiaocheng felt a suffocating discomfort. [[392 旁白 neutral]]
She was dizzy and lightheaded, relying on a thread of reason to keep herself from collapsing. [[393 旁白 neutral]]
"System, how many Emotion Points do I have now?" [[394 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng forced herself up, her small body leaning against the shoe cabinet, her legs spread out straight in an ungraceful pose that made her skirt ride up. [[395 旁白 neutral]]
Even though it was an unflattering pose, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't care less. [[396 旁白 neutral]]
The System in her mind responded. [[397 旁白 neutral]]
[Replying to Host, you have 68 points.] [[398 系统 neutral]]
"That's quite a lot." [[399 池小橙 happy]]
She thought buying the beginner's gift pack had used up all her Emotion Points. [[400 旁白 neutral]]
[Ye Liang also had an emotional reaction to you because of Su Tao's words.] [[401 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng checked the log; Ye Liang had only provided 30 Emotion Points. [[402 旁白 neutral]]
If someone wanted to kill another person, [[403 旁白 neutral]]
they would never provide so few Emotion Points. [[404 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed Su Tao had talked him out of it. [[405 旁白 neutral]]
As expected of Tao Tao. [[406 池小橙 happy]]
She saved my life. [[407 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng showed a happy smile, but with her slightly chapped lips, the smile looked a bit enchanting. [[408 旁白 neutral]]
"System, filter the items for me. I need medicine I can afford that will heal my body immediately." [[409 池小橙 neutral]]
[Recommended purchase: System-brand Vitamin C pills. Effective in one dose.] [[410 系统 neutral]]
"Buy, buy, buy!" [[411 池小橙 happy]]
[50 Emotion Points have been spent.] [[412 系统 neutral]]
With a flash of white light, a pill appeared in Chi Xiaocheng's hand, and the System thoughtfully provided a glass of water in her other hand. [[413 旁白 neutral]]
She swallowed it immediately. [[414 旁白 neutral]]
A moment later, she felt a comfortable warmth spreading through her body. [[415 旁白 neutral]]
Her lower abdomen felt warm. [[416 旁白 neutral]]
The ringing in her ears gradually faded, and some strength returned to her body. [[417 旁白 neutral]]
After resting for about ten minutes, Chi Xiaocheng slowly got up. [[418 旁白 neutral]]
"It works fast, but it's too expensive." [[419 池小橙 sad]]
50 Emotion Points! I risked my life for that! [[420 池小橙 sad]]
Now that she was out of danger, Chi Xiaocheng finally had a chance to reflect on her character's situation. [[421 旁白 neutral]]
Without a doubt, she was the villainess side character meant to be sacrificed. [[422 旁白 neutral]]
And a foolish one at that, who didn't know how to assess situations or use her advantages. [[423 旁白 neutral]]
The female lead was very good to her, and besides the male leads, there were plenty of other supporting male characters pursuing the female lead. [[424 旁白 neutral]]
If she had just used the female lead and the supporting characters around her, played the innocent "white lotus" to drive a wedge between the female lead and the other male characters, she could have lived a good life. With some luck, she might have even won over one of the male leads. [[425 旁白 neutral]]
But it was as if she were cursed. [[426 旁白 neutral]]
She relentlessly targeted the female lead who cherished her, and the male leads who originally had a decent impression of her. [[427 旁白 neutral]]
If Su Tao's affection for Chi Xiaocheng was at 80 points two years ago, [[428 旁白 neutral]]
then now, more than half of it was probably gone. [[429 旁白 neutral]]
"What a waste of this body and its advantageous relationships." [[430 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed and took a sip of water, "Maybe this is the fate of a side character. Life or death depends entirely on what the author writes." [[431 池小橙 sad]]
It wouldn't be easy to change this deadly ending. [[432 旁白 neutral]]
But. [[433 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't completely hopeless. [[434 旁白 neutral]]
As long as the female lead, Su Tao, didn't give up on her, she could rely on the "protagonist's halo" to stay alive for now. [[435 旁白 neutral]]
Shaking her head, Chi Xiaocheng temporarily pushed those thoughts aside. [[436 旁白 neutral]]
After spending so long in the basement, having a close interaction with Su Tao, and then being chased, Chi Xiaocheng felt dirty all over. [[437 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't wait to take a shower. [[438 旁白 neutral]]
Before she even took off her clothes, she went to the sink outside the bathroom and was startled when she saw her reflection. [[439 旁白 neutral]]
"What is this?" [[440 池小橙 angry]]
In the mirror, her slightly round face was covered in terrible foundation, and her makeup was smudged in many places from sweating. [[441 旁白 neutral]]
The eyeliner was poorly drawn, the blush was applied carelessly—it was clearly very low-quality makeup. [[442 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how pretty a girl is, ruining her looks like this wouldn't score her any points, right? [[443 旁白 neutral]]
It was only then that Chi Xiaocheng remembered. The original owner had been influenced by her friends to believe that college students should wear beautiful makeup. How it was applied didn't matter; what mattered was the confidence it gave. [[444 旁白 neutral]]
Every time she put on this clownish makeup, her so-called friends would praise her, saying, "You look great, girl, shining with confidence!" When she posted photos online, she would get a stream of comments like, "You're so pretty," and "You have great features." The simple-minded original owner actually believed them. [[445 旁白 neutral]]
She wore a clown face every day. [[446 旁白 neutral]]
"No wonder the male leads' affection for her is so low. This is a society that judges by looks!" [[447 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng was incredibly thankful that she hadn't looked up and shown her face to the helpful stranger earlier. [[448 旁白 happy]]
Otherwise, the outcome would have been very different. [[449 旁白 neutral]]
"It's so messy, even I can't stand looking at it." [[450 池小橙 sad]]
She tried to wipe it off with water, but then remembered, "I should use makeup remover for this. Let me see where it is..." [[451 池小橙 neutral]]
In her past life, she had barely touched makeup. Now... well, she was fitting nicely into the role of a delicate girl like the original owner. [[452 旁白 neutral]]
After some effort, the cheap makeup was finally removed. [[453 旁白 neutral]]
Her bare face, dotted with water droplets, appeared in the mirror. [[454 旁白 neutral]]
She had a small, delicate nose and exquisite features. Although her face was a bit pale, her naturally frail expression added a touch of pitiable weakness. [[455 旁白 neutral]]
Her long, tea-colored hair was down. Chi Xiaocheng touched it, her big eyes shining. [[456 旁白 happy]]
The hair quality was excellent; it didn't look like she was malnourished. [[457 旁白 neutral]]
And most importantly, her bare face was so cute! [[458 旁白 happy]]
With a slight pout of her chubby cheeks, her cuteness was enough to be a critical hit for any fan of cute girls. [[459 旁白 neutral]]
Her skin was also as white as fine jade. [[460 旁白 neutral]]
"What was the original owner thinking? Her natural face could outshine so many girls her age. That clownish makeup lowered her attractiveness by several levels!" [[461 池小橙 angry]]
"At the very least, she could have worn black-rimmed glasses and an ugly, thick coat to look weaker. Just with this pitiful face, she could cosplay as Shen Youchu." [[462 池小橙 neutral]]
"Ah—" [[463 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened her mouth and took another look. [[464 旁白 neutral]]
Her tongue was pink, her teeth small and even. A small, sharp canine tooth stuck out slightly, but it didn't ruin the overall look. For some people, it was even a cute feature. [[465 旁白 neutral]]
"With these looks, so cute... if I had transmigrated back when she was a child, the male leads wouldn't have stood a chance." [[466 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng could have easily won over Su Tao. [[467 旁白 neutral]]
She stepped into the bathroom to shower. [[468 旁白 neutral]]
Size isn't everything; shape and fullness are what matter. [[469 旁白 neutral]]
Her own assets were already perfect enough. [[470 旁白 neutral]]
Although she was a bit thin, for her height of 152cm, she wasn't underdeveloped. [[471 旁白 neutral]]
If her body weren't so weak right now, Chi Xiaocheng would have really liked to... experience it. [[472 旁白 neutral]]
She dried the water droplets from her body. [[473 旁白 neutral]]
Then she went into her room and opened the closet. [[474 旁白 neutral]]
After getting dressed, she frowned at the room's decor. [[475 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike her cute but frail appearance, the room was filled with ominous things. [[476 旁白 neutral]]
On the wall were photos of Su Tao with the male leads. A notebook on the desk was filled with the name "Su Tao," along with the names of the male leads, which were all crossed out in thick, red ink. Even the faces in the photos on the wall had been scratched out. [[477 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed and got to work. [[478 旁白 neutral]]
She packed up all these old things and threw them away, only stopping to wipe the sweat from her brow when the room was simple and plain. [[479 旁白 neutral]]
She took out her phone again. [[480 旁白 neutral]]
After thinking it over, she pointed her camera at her bare face, used a cool light to make her skin look paler, and squeezed out a couple of tears. [[481 旁白 neutral]]
*Click—* [[482 旁白 neutral]]
The photo was taken. [[483 旁白 neutral]]
"A true natural beauty, no filter or editing needed. So cute." [[484 池小橙 happy]]
She added a caption and posted it. [[485 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry." — Visible to everyone. [[486 池小橙 sad]]
"Like you like you like you like you like you like you like you." — Visible only to Su Tao. [[487 池小橙 happy]]
Xiaocheng [[488 池小橙 neutral]]
