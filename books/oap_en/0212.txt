Chapter 212: Love Isn't Obedience, It's Taking the Initiative [[18482 旁白 sad]]
For over a month, Su Tao had almost completely shut herself off, hesitating between the past and her memories. [[18483 旁白 sad]]
Of course, she had thought about many things. [[18484 旁白 neutral]]
This included ideas like Chi Xiaocheng not being dead, that she was still alive and would wake up, that she herself had died instead, or even accepting the yandere version of her from the start. [[18485 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, she had many choices, like playing a lighthearted galgame. [[18486 旁白 neutral]]
She could have closed her eyes, picked randomly, or skipped ahead, and as long as she aimed to win over the female lead, Xiaocheng, she would have reached the perfect ending. [[18487 旁白 neutral]]
But in reality, faced with countless choices, she picked the wrong one every time. [[18488 旁白 sad]]
And then she entered a Bad End that very few people trigger. [[18489 旁白 sad]]
If Xiaocheng came back to life, what would she want to do? [[18490 旁白 neutral]]
She dreamed of Chi Xiaocheng coming back to life, and with everyone's advice and scolding, she gradually understood what she had to do if she really woke up. [[18491 旁白 neutral]]
Confess to her! [[18492 旁白 neutral]]
Be with her! [[18493 旁白 neutral]]
This was what she wanted most before she died, her last wish. Only by doing this could she prevent her from becoming a yandere. [[18494 旁白 neutral]]
But what about after the confession? [[18495 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hadn't thought that far ahead. [[18496 旁白 neutral]]
For her, Chi Xiaocheng coming back to life was already the best possible news, so she didn't have the luxury of thinking about anything better. [[18497 旁白 neutral]]
But Cheng Cheng had just thrown the idea she was subconsciously avoiding right onto the table. [[18498 旁白 neutral]]
Those dark eyes staring at her were incredibly deep, and for a moment, Su Tao even imagined them as Chi Xiaocheng's pair of red pupils. [[18499 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Su Tao lower her head in silence, Cheng Cheng asked lightly, "Have you still not figured it out and don't know what to do?" [[18500 程程 neutral]]
Hearing her words, Su Tao took a deep breath. "No!" [[18501 苏桃 neutral]]
Her eyes became determined, and she clenched her fists. "No matter what, I will stand by Xiaocheng. If she becomes a yandere, then I will accept her yandere side and love her!" [[18502 苏桃 neutral]]
This declaration surprised Cheng Cheng a little. "Such a high level of awareness?" [[18503 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao let out a breath. "I've already made enough mistakes because of my hesitation and avoidance. I don't want to repeat them. Even if the road ahead is difficult, I'll force myself to adapt and get used to it." [[18504 苏桃 sad]]
She didn't want to disappoint her again. [[18505 旁白 sad]]
Cheng Cheng took a light sip of water, her gaze shifting to Su Tao's thighs, which were covered by cotton pants. [[18506 旁白 neutral]]
Her two clenched fists resting on them were trembling slightly. [[18507 旁白 neutral]]
It was clear that she had summoned all her courage to say this and had mentally prepared herself in a short amount of time. [[18508 旁白 neutral]]
If Chi Xiaocheng really became incredibly twisted after that. [[18509 旁白 neutral]]
Then she would accept her twisted nature. [[18510 旁白 neutral]]
After speaking, Su Tao turned to her friend beside her. "Cheng Cheng, you've also researched yandere. If you were Xiaocheng..." [[18511 苏桃 neutral]]
As she said this, Su Tao didn't notice that Cheng Cheng's hand holding the cup trembled as if she had been burned. [[18512 旁白 neutral]]
She continued, "If you put yourself in her shoes, how would you react to an answer like mine?" [[18513 苏桃 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng thought for a moment, taking a tactical sip of water. "I'd be a little relieved, but I wouldn't be too happy or pleased." [[18514 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned. "Why?" [[18515 苏桃 sad]]
Cheng Cheng said, "First, I'm not Xiaochengzi, so I don't know what she's thinking." [[18516 程程 neutral]]
"Second, from my personal perspective, I'm relieved because you were always running away before, and now you finally dare to face it, even if you're doing it by pressuring yourself." [[18517 程程 neutral]]
"But I wouldn't be too happy, because your love, your confession, and your acceptance of her yandere side don't truly come from you." [[18518 程程 neutral]]
"Instead, they come from some external pressure, or because it's something you feel you have to do." [[18519 程程 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng put down the water and looked at Su Tao. "You want to confess after Xiaochengzi wakes up because her last wish was to be with you, right? You mentioned you argued about this before she died." [[18520 程程 neutral]]
"And accepting her yandere side is a reluctant choice because you don't know what else to do and you can't go against her." [[18521 程程 neutral]]
"It's not that you've realized the key point: 'Her yandere side is also for my sake, so I will love that part of her too.'" [[18522 程程 neutral]]
"Taozi, you need to put yourself in her shoes. In your future together, you can't just blindly obey her, understand?" [[18523 程程 neutral]]
Hearing her words, Su Tao lowered her head and bit her lip slightly. [[18524 苏桃 sad]]
If she were to be completely honest with herself. [[18525 旁白 neutral]]
She did like Chi Xiaocheng a little, that was definitely true. [[18526 旁白 neutral]]
It was different from the complicated sisterly affection she once felt; it even transcended gender. She enjoyed the feeling of being by Chi Xiaocheng's side, loved it when she would stick close to her and affectionately call her "Tao Tao." [[18527 旁白 happy]]
After Chi Xiaocheng died and she had those dreams, she became even more certain that this was what she understood as love. [[18528 旁白 neutral]]
But it was undeniable that Chi Xiaocheng had also put a lot of pressure on her. [[18529 旁白 sad]]
Compared to her other emotions and thoughts, this feeling of love was just 'a little.' [[18530 旁白 neutral]]
Just as the status glasses showed, her favorability score for Chi Xiaocheng was only around 65. [[18531 旁白 neutral]]
Even with her confession after she woke up, love would only be part of it. A larger part was likely because Chi Xiaocheng 'expected' her to do it. [[18532 旁白 sad]]
The words were a wake-up call. [[18533 旁白 neutral]]
But after waking up, Su Tao didn't know how to change. [[18534 苏桃 sad]]
Just then, Cheng Cheng glanced over and asked, "Your silence means I was right, doesn't it?" [[18535 程程 neutral]]
There was no one else around, so Su Tao nodded dejectedly. "Mostly... you were right about a lot of it." [[18536 苏桃 sad]]
Cheng Cheng said, "You see, you've never truly lost her, that's why you're caught in this conflict." [[18537 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao pouted. "I've already lost her twice." [[18538 苏桃 sad]]
Cheng Cheng said, "You know that's not the kind of loss I'm talking about." [[18539 程程 neutral]]
After she spoke, Su Tao fell silent. [[18540 旁白 neutral]]
It was unclear what she was thinking about. [[18541 旁白 neutral]]
It's difficult to figure things out on your own. [[18542 旁白 neutral]]
You can't teach a person a lesson with words, but they'll learn it from one experience. [[18543 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, it all came down to one thing. [[18544 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng just wanted Su Tao to love her more. [[18545 旁白 neutral]]
For her to pay more attention and care more, to fill that missing sense of security. [[18546 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, Cheng Cheng glanced at the time on the wall clock. Seeing that Su Tao couldn't figure it out, she stood up and said, "Think about it yourself. I'm going to go." [[18547 程程 neutral]]
"Eh?" [[18548 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao stood up as well. "You're leaving so soon? I was planning to treat you to lunch." [[18549 苏桃 neutral]]
Cheng Cheng shrugged. "Looking at your current state, you don't seem to be in the mood for a good lunch, do you?" [[18550 程程 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Actually, I'm waiting for a friend. A really good friend from a while ago. We haven't seen each other in some time, and I wanted to introduce you. I have a feeling you two would get along." [[18551 苏桃 happy]]
Hearing this, Cheng Cheng narrowed her eyes. "A really good friend?" [[18552 程程 neutral]]
"Yeah, a friend from junior high. She helped me out at the last birthday banquet, so I wanted to treat her to a meal to thank her properly." [[18553 苏桃 happy]]
Cheng Cheng glanced at the time on the wall again. There was still an hour and a half before she had to go home for the holidays. [[18554 旁白 neutral]]
So she sat back down calmly. "Now that you say that, I'm not in such a hurry anymore. You know I love making new friends." [[18555 程程 happy]]
