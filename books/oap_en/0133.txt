Chapter 133: Intermediate Acting is So Useful [[11691 旁白 neutral]]
Sincere and determined words can always touch a person's heart. As Su Tao spoke, Chi Xiaocheng had already turned her head. [[11692 旁白 neutral]]
She stared intently into her eyes, [[11693 旁白 neutral]]
unsure if she was checking for lies, [[11694 旁白 neutral]]
or preparing to confess her own feelings. [[11695 旁白 neutral]]
As their eyes met, Su Tao suddenly grew tense. [[11696 旁白 neutral]]
Her hands were already holding Chi Xiaocheng's, and she subconsciously squeezed them tighter. [[11697 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could clearly feel such a small movement. [[11698 旁白 neutral]]
If she confessed again, she would really say yes. [[11699 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could feel Su Tao's firm resolve. [[11700 旁白 neutral]]
But it was only resolve, not love. [[11701 旁白 neutral]]
She waited for a long time, until Su Tao was so nervous her palms were about to sweat, then Chi Xiaocheng abruptly turned her head away. "No." [[11702 池小橙 neutral]]
"Eh?" [[11703 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao hadn't expected Chi Xiaocheng to say that. [[11704 旁白 neutral]]
"I don't like Taotao anymore, so I won't say things like that." [[11705 池小橙 neutral]]
Besides, saying it again wouldn't win your affection. [[11706 旁白 neutral]]
Next time, you'll have to be the one to confess to me. [[11707 旁白 neutral]]
You'll even have to beg me to do it! [[11708 旁白 happy]]
Since Su Tao feels guilty now, I might as well tease her a little more. [[11709 旁白 happy]]
It's the same old story: people don't cherish what they get too easily. [[11710 旁白 neutral]]
I have to be like a little cat, keeping my distance, playing hot and cold, and stringing her along for a bit. [[11711 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng had a perfect plan, and she truly knew how to get a read on Su Tao's thoughts. [[11712 旁白 neutral]]
But she underestimated Su Tao's resolve. [[11713 旁白 neutral]]
I can't keep getting rejected like this. If I don't take the initiative, nothing will ever happen. [[11714 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, I need to soothe Xiaocheng's emotions and get her to cooperate with her treatment. [[11715 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao closed her eyes. [[11716 旁白 neutral]]
She recalled Professor Su's words. [[11717 旁白 neutral]]
Force yourself to fall in love with her. [[11718 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe in the future, I'll look back and see that I had more options, but right now, there's no other choice, is there? [[11719 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao opened her eyes again and let out a gentle sigh. [[11720 旁白 neutral]]
Her expression suddenly grew much firmer. Su Tao reached out and forced Chi Xiaocheng to continue meeting her gaze. [[11721 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao asked very seriously, "Xiaocheng, do you really not like me anymore?" [[11722 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng tried to turn her head away but wasn't strong enough. She could only huff, "I don't!" [[11723 池小橙 angry]]
You don't like me? [[11724 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's lips curved into a smile. She tilted her head and suddenly leaned closer. [[11725 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao: "How about now? Do you like me now?" [[11726 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "I don't... Mmph!!!" [[11727 池小橙 neutral]]
You say you like me every day, but now you're afraid to admit it? [[11728 旁白 happy]]
"How about now?" [[11729 苏桃 happy]]
"Ugh~" [[11730 池小橙 sad]]
Tears welled up in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. "You're cheating!" [[11731 池小橙 angry]]
Su Tao wiped the side of her cheek and pressed her index finger between Chi Xiaocheng's eyebrows. "Now, I'll give you one last chance. Do you like me or not?" [[11732 苏桃 neutral]]
Since they were so close, their hanging hair was almost tangled together. [[11733 旁白 neutral]]
The tips of Su Tao's ears were a little red, but she remained forceful. [[11734 旁白 neutral]]
As for Chi Xiaocheng, it wasn't clear if it was her intermediate acting skill or real shyness, but a blush appeared on her cute cheeks, and she didn't react as expected. [[11735 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she shyly closed her eyes. "If I... if I say I like you, can we continue?" [[11736 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao froze, her heart feeling like it had been scratched by a kitten. [[11737 旁白 neutral]]
A while later, looking at Chi Xiaocheng hiding her face with a pillow, too shy to be seen, Su Tao touched her finger to her lips. [[11738 旁白 happy]]
This isn't so bad, actually. [[11739 旁白 happy]]
She smoothed Chi Xiaocheng's hair and said slowly, "I'm going back to my room to take my medicine. Xiaocheng, remember to listen to the doctor and take yours too, okay?" [[11740 苏桃 neutral]]
"I... I know." [[11741 池小橙 neutral]]
Good, at least she's communicating and being obedient again. [[11742 旁白 happy]]
Doctor Cheng's method really works! [[11743 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao took out her phone, thinking of messaging Doctor Cheng, but decided against it. [[11744 旁白 neutral]]
This is the first step in forcing myself to like Xiaocheng, right? [[11745 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Su Tao started to get up, Chi Xiaocheng poked her head out again and asked timidly, "Taotao, do you like me?" [[11746 池小橙 neutral]]
"Didn't I already say so?" Su Tao smiled helplessly. "Of course, I like you." [[11747 苏桃 happy]]
"Will you only like me?" [[11748 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded again. "Of course." [[11749 苏桃 neutral]]
"But... sometimes I'm a little abnormal..." [[11750 池小橙 sad]]
As if feeling insecure, Chi Xiaocheng exposed her weakness. [[11751 旁白 neutral]]
This was also something written in the suicide note. [[11752 旁白 neutral]]
She had already noticed her own abnormality. [[11753 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's heart sank, but she kept a smile on her face, patting Chi Xiaocheng's head. "In my eyes, Xiaocheng is Xiaocheng. No matter what, I will always like you." [[11754 苏桃 neutral]]
After she spoke, Chi Xiaocheng looked up again, and her red eyes showed a hint of turning into vertical pupils. [[11755 旁白 neutral]]
This was a sign of her yandere side emerging! [[11756 旁白 neutral]]
Even her smile held a slightly abnormal expectation. "What if... I want to lock Taotao up again?" [[11757 池小橙 neutral]]
Just like last time, to possess you completely! [[11758 旁白 neutral]]
But the difference is, I don't want to force you anymore. [[11759 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe, you need to force yourself a little to accept my yandere side, hehe~ [[11760 旁白 happy]]
This was the first time she had made such a direct request. [[11761 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the yandere head-on! [[11762 旁白 neutral]]
There was no escape. [[11763 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's expression gradually froze, and her hand paused on Chi Xiaocheng's head. [[11764 旁白 neutral]]
Locked up? Does she mean like last time, stuck in a room, not even knowing the time? [[11765 旁白 sad]]
She felt a little scared and instinctively wanted to step back, but reason overcame her fear. If she refused now, how would it be any different from before? [[11766 旁白 neutral]]
But if she didn't refuse... [[11767 旁白 neutral]]
Meeting that expectant gaze, Su Tao forced a smile. "If... if it's just in the room, and we don't do anything special, then... it's okay." [[11768 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's just that, I'm usually quite busy, so... two days at most, okay?" [[11769 苏桃 neutral]]
If you can't refuse, then take a step back. [[11770 旁白 neutral]]
Right now, Xiaocheng hasn't fully turned yandere, so the terms are negotiable. [[11771 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew what Su Tao was thinking and squinted her eyes happily. "I won't do anything to Taotao, I just want to be alone with you and play some games~" [[11772 池小橙 happy]]
What? It's just about playing games? [[11773 旁白 neutral]]
That makes sense. Xiaocheng is feeling insecure, and her yandere instincts make her possessive. [[11774 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe Xiaocheng just wants me to spend more time with her. [[11775 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao knew that since Chi Xiaocheng hadn't turned fully yandere, it might be different from last time, so she agreed. [[11776 旁白 neutral]]
Naturally, Chi Xiaocheng was incredibly well-behaved. [[11777 旁白 neutral]]
But this time was different. [[11778 旁白 neutral]]
Being difficult, having a little temper, acting all cute and submissive. [[11779 旁白 happy]]
Isn't this the version of me that you like, Taotao? [[11780 旁白 happy]]
This way, I can slowly lower Taotao's guard, and then when I get out of the hospital... [[11781 旁白 happy]]
Intermediate acting is so useful. [[11782 旁白 happy]]
A red light flashed in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes, and her smile revealed her small canine teeth, making her look even cuter. [[11783 旁白 happy]]
