Chapter 119: Taotao, Goodnight [[10505 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's eyes gradually became determined. [[10506 旁白 neutral]]
She had figured it out. [[10507 旁白 neutral]]
Just as the dark Xiaocheng had said, as a cannon fodder side character, if she didn't keep Su Tao firmly in her grasp, Su Tao would inevitably trigger various plot points and cause all sorts of trouble. [[10508 池小橙 neutral]]
And under the correction of the world's will, she would return to the original novel's final ending. [[10509 池小橙 neutral]]
As for her, the cannon fodder, she would gradually be forgotten by Su Tao. [[10510 池小橙 sad]]
Just like what happened in the past half-month. [[10511 池小橙 sad]]
She thought that by being well-behaved, she could make Su Tao like her forever. [[10512 池小橙 sad]]
But she never expected that when Su Tao saw how well-behaved she was, she went off to handle other things instead. [[10513 池小橙 sad]]
In that case, she would tie Su Tao firmly to her side! [[10514 池小橙 angry]]
The normal me can't make you like me. [[10515 池小橙 sad]]
So, you must prefer the pathological me, right? [[10516 池小橙 neutral]]
Just like when I acted as a yandere, that love belonged only to you. [[10517 池小橙 neutral]]
"So, between me and your fiancé, who would you choose?" [[10518 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't act immediately; instead, she first arranged her "final affairs." [[10519 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian, Fang Ning, and even her "Dr. Cheng" alias needed to go into seclusion for a while. [[10520 旁白 neutral]]
When Si Chen received Chi Xiaocheng's message, he was completely stunned. "You're saying you plan to fake your own death?" [[10521 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "Yes, is there a problem?" [[10522 池小橙 neutral]]
Si Chen: "How do you plan to fake your death?" [[10523 司辰 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at her wrist and slowly typed out two words. [[10524 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing this, Si Chen gasped several times, contributing to global warming while feeling his blood run cold. [[10525 旁白 neutral]]
"Sis... I'm calling you Sis, alright?" [[10526 司辰 sad]]
"Are you sure that's faking death?" [[10527 司辰 angry]]
"The chance of you actually dying is higher than faking it!" [[10528 司辰 angry]]
He did want Chi Xiaocheng to be a bit crazier, so she could win over Su Tao faster and better. Then, when her War God father returned, she could immediately help him reclaim his position as the Si family heir. [[10529 旁白 neutral]]
But he never expected Chi Xiaocheng to be so ruthless! [[10530 旁白 neutral]]
While he was still stunned, another file was sent over. [[10531 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng: "This is some information related to Ye Liang. With your methods, you can definitely handle it, right?" [[10532 池小橙 neutral]]
This was something she learned from the original novel's plot and had prepared to send to Si Chen long ago. [[10533 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen opened the file with a puzzled expression, which quickly turned to shock. [[10534 旁白 neutral]]
It was all about the loopholes in Ye Liang's businesses! [[10535 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang's businesses were widespread and had many loopholes. Si Chen himself had a plan to slowly chip away at them. Now that Ye Liang was hospitalized, these loopholes would only grow larger. [[10536 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng... could she be arranging her own funeral? [[10537 司辰 sad]]
If she really died, was this file his compensation? [[10538 司辰 sad]]
Si Chen originally thought that investing in Chi Xiaocheng was a risky move, and he would have to rely on her mood for any returns. He never expected this. [[10539 旁白 neutral]]
"I really misunderstood Chi Xiaocheng." Si Chen sat in his office, lit a cigarette, and felt incredibly moved. [[10540 司辰 neutral]]
His confidant, who was also looking at the chat log on the computer, said, "Young master, should we change our plans soon?" [[10541 心腹 neutral]]
Si Chen rubbed his chin thoughtfully, "Indeed. Do you think I could get the words on my back gilded?" [[10542 司辰 neutral]]
If you want the horse to run, you have to feed it grass. [[10543 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew her partnership with Si Chen was purely transactional. This file was the grass she was feeding him. [[10544 旁白 neutral]]
Originally, Chi Xiaocheng's best plan for faking her death was to get a fake body from the System. If she really died, she would escape to Lizhi City. [[10545 旁白 neutral]]
Then she would use the System to help Chi Song and Long Ge build their influence. [[10546 旁白 neutral]]
But that wasn't necessary anymore. [[10547 旁白 neutral]]
"Only when she almost loses me will Taotao cherish me and hold on to me tightly." [[10548 池小橙 neutral]]
"Just like on the rooftop." [[10549 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng always believed that of all the times she pretended to be a yandere, the rooftop incident left the deepest impression on Su Tao. [[10550 旁白 neutral]]
Since you don't cherish me, and you don't like me, then I'll just leave. [[10551 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng took out another piece of paper and gently wrote three large words on it—To Taotao. [[10552 旁白 neutral]]
This was a... suicide note! [[10553 旁白 neutral]]
After making a mess in the living room, Chi Xiaocheng locked Da Wang in a room. [[10554 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly walked towards the bathroom alone. [[10555 旁白 neutral]]
She filled the bathtub with water and slowly lay down in it. [[10556 旁白 neutral]]
"System, you're not even going to try and stop me?" [[10557 池小橙 neutral]]
With everything ready, Chi Xiaocheng asked curiously in her mind. [[10558 旁白 neutral]]
The System was silent for a long time before slowly replying. [[10559 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, I am just a system. I cannot be your companion.] [[10560 系统 neutral]]
[No matter what happens, I will always be on your side.] [[10561 系统 neutral]]
"Thank you." [[10562 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng lay in the bathtub, slowly closing her crimson, vertical pupils. [[10563 旁白 neutral]]
A strange smile appeared on her lips. [[10564 旁白 neutral]]
"Well then, Taotao, goodnight~" [[10565 池小橙 happy]]
*Sizzle—* [[10566 旁白 neutral]]
The water in the bathtub gradually turned red. [[10567 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, Su Tao, who was arriving at the "Sky Loft" hotel with Dongfang Yang, suddenly felt a pang in her heart. [[10568 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly turned her head, looking frantically in the direction of Chi Xiaocheng's apartment complex. [[10569 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang asked from the side, "What's wrong?" [[10570 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lip, "It's nothing, my heart just feels heavy." [[10571 苏桃 sad]]
She took out her phone and looked at a message from half an hour ago: "Taotao, when are you coming back?" [[10572 旁白 neutral]]
The moment she saw it, Su Tao imagined the terrifying scene from the rooftop. [[10573 旁白 neutral]]
Back then, Chi Xiaocheng had also sent a long series of similar messages. [[10574 旁白 neutral]]
She had been tied up with Ye Liang at the time and hesitated for a long while. [[10575 旁白 neutral]]
And it almost led to a tragedy. [[10576 旁白 neutral]]
If Xiaocheng had gathered her courage and really jumped then, everything would have been different. [[10577 旁白 neutral]]
Because of that, she had replied quickly half an hour ago. [[10578 旁白 neutral]]
She would be back in about an hour. [[10579 旁白 neutral]]
After what happened today, there was no way she wouldn't go back to comfort her. [[10580 旁白 neutral]]
She should have gone back with her right after leaving the police station, but she didn't expect Xiao Ming to find her again. [[10581 旁白 neutral]]
The jade pendant. [[10582 旁白 neutral]]
Father. [[10583 旁白 neutral]]
The marriage certificate. [[10584 旁白 neutral]]
And Xiaocheng. [[10585 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's heart felt heavy. [[10586 旁白 neutral]]
The only thing she was thankful for was that Chi Xiaocheng's message was just a simple question, not a creepy, repetitive line like last time. [[10587 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng hadn't replied to her message. She was probably asleep, right? [[10588 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang watched Su Tao's expression change and said helplessly, "If you're so worried about her, then hurry up and finish your business here so you can go back. You two just had a little fight, are you really afraid she'll do something foolish?" [[10589 东方阳 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang didn't expect Su Tao to nod directly this time. "Do you remember what happened on the rooftop?" [[10590 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang frowned. [[10591 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, he remembered. Chi Xiaocheng had shown self-harm tendencies before. [[10592 旁白 neutral]]
Later analysis suggested that people around her were causing it. [[10593 旁白 neutral]]
But after the psychological report came out, he realized that Chi Xiaocheng was not normal to begin with. With her mild personality split, it wouldn't be strange for her to do anything. [[10594 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao stared blankly at the unanswered message. "It was the same at Ye Liang's banquet. Xiaocheng sent me a lot of messages, and when I got back to school, she was on the rooftop, and almost jumped off because of me." [[10595 苏桃 sad]]
Hearing this, Dongfang Yang clicked his tongue. "You're becoming less and less like the Su Tao I knew. So indecisive, I don't even know what you're thinking all the time." [[10596 东方阳 angry]]
With that, he flung his trench coat and strode into the hotel first, his expression grim. "Let's go. I want to see what this Xiao Ming is all about, daring to present a marriage certificate like this!" [[10597 东方阳 angry]]
