Chapter 191: Miracle [[16673 旁白 neutral]]
As the scenery flashed by, Su Tao sat in the sports car, unable to figure out what surprise Dongfang Yang was talking about. [[16674 旁白 neutral]]
First, she ruled out the possibility of Xiaocheng coming back to life; it was just too unrealistic. [[16675 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be that Xiao Ming and Lin Fangya had been found? [[16676 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe something about Brother Chi Song? [[16677 旁白 neutral]]
It could also be related to her father! [[16678 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of that last point, Su Tao's heart sank a little. She originally had some hope for this father she had never met. [[16679 旁白 sad]]
But the marriage contract, and Xiao Ming's repulsive blond hair, had made much of that hope disappear. [[16680 旁白 sad]]
It was just as Dongfang Yang had said. [[16681 旁白 neutral]]
"If he cared about me, why didn't he come back sooner?" [[16682 苏桃 sad]]
"A person I've never even met comes back with a marriage contract. What does that even mean?" [[16683 苏桃 angry]]
She had some contact with the upper-class circles, and her belated realization was that her father wanted to use her to tie down Xiao Ming. [[16684 旁白 neutral]]
After all, according to Dongfang Yang, this guy was some kind of "Dragon King." [[16685 旁白 neutral]]
While she was lost in thought, the car stopped. "What are you thinking about? We're here." [[16686 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment, then quickly recovered and said, "Nothing... I was wondering how Fang Ning was last night." [[16687 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang put his hands in the pockets of his red coat and walked helplessly towards the door. "That little one is emotionally stable, but she doesn't seem to have much will to live. There's nothing physically wrong with her, but staying in the hospital is too depressing." [[16688 东方阳 neutral]]
"I arranged for a doctor to look after her and then left her at a cat cafe. As long as she doesn't hate cats and dogs, the small animals might be able to help her heal." [[16689 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao: "I'm always troubling you, I'm sor... Thank you." [[16690 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Su Tao in surprise. "I thought you were going to apologize again. That 'thank you' sounds much better." [[16691 东方阳 happy]]
"Xiaocheng taught me," Su Tao said, quickly changing the subject. "By the way, what was the surprise you mentioned earlier?" [[16692 苏桃 neutral]]
"First, come with me to see Professor Su." [[16693 东方阳 neutral]]
Going straight to the fifth floor, Su Tao found that Professor Su happened to be in Chi Xiaocheng's hospital room. [[16694 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the familiar face appeared before her, Su Tao's once-firm gaze instantly softened with guilt. [[16695 旁白 sad]]
Ever since she stepped into the hospital, she had been mentally preparing herself. [[16696 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll just take one more look at Xiaocheng, that's all." [[16697 苏桃 sad]]
"I saw her in my dream last night." [[16698 苏桃 sad]]
But as her gaze fell upon the person on the hospital bed, tears welled up in her eyes. [[16699 旁白 sad]]
In that moment of distraction, Su Tao didn't even notice the sophisticated instruments connected to Chi Xiaocheng. [[16700 旁白 sad]]
Professor Su stood aside, waiting for Su Tao to calm down, and gave Dongfang Yang a puzzled look. [[16701 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she were asking why he had brought Su Tao here. [[16702 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang just shrugged helplessly. [[16703 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't brought her here; Su Tao had asked to come herself. [[16704 旁白 neutral]]
Neither of them spoke, not wanting to disturb Su Tao. [[16705 旁白 neutral]]
After sitting by the bed for a full three minutes, the young woman wiped her eyes and said firmly, "Dongfang Yang, Professor Su, thank you for preserving Xiaocheng's body for so long, but I think we should cremate her as soon as possible." [[16706 苏桃 sad]]
Hearing this, Professor Su, who was drinking water, almost choked. [[16707 旁白 neutral]]
She coughed a few times and said to Su Tao, "Miss Su, please don't get emotional. Please take a closer look at Miss Chi's condition." [[16708 苏教授 neutral]]
"Condition?" [[16709 苏桃 neutral]]
She tilted her head and instinctively looked at the heart monitor first. [[16710 旁白 neutral]]
It was still a flat line. But... [[16711 旁白 neutral]]
Neither her skin nor her complexion looked like someone who had been dead for over half a month. [[16712 旁白 neutral]]
Even her light brown hair was incredibly shiny. [[16713 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao reached out to hold Chi Xiaocheng's hand and was surprised to feel a hint of warmth! [[16714 旁白 happy]]
She quickly looked at Professor Su. "What's happening with Xiaocheng? Is she alive?!" [[16715 苏桃 happy]]
Professor Su said slowly, "I'm not entirely sure myself. Half a month ago, we were certain that Miss Chi was dead. We intended to preserve the body temporarily, but we later discovered that even though her heart had stopped beating." [[16716 苏教授 neutral]]
"Her cells are still active!" [[16717 苏教授 happy]]
"Not just active, they are automatically repairing her body!" [[16718 苏教授 happy]]
The more Professor Su spoke, the more excited she became. "Something like this has never happened in our country... no, in the entire world. It's nothing short of a miracle!" [[16719 苏教授 happy]]
She took a deep breath to calm herself. "The cells are still repairing her body, and you can feel that her body temperature, which was gone, has started to return." [[16720 苏教授 happy]]
Su Tao's eyes widened, and her breath caught in her throat. "So, does that mean Xiaocheng really has a chance to live?!" [[16721 苏桃 happy]]
"We can't be certain about that." Professor Su shook her head. "No breathing, no heartbeat—those are the facts right in front of us." [[16722 苏教授 sad]]
Su Tao's expression dimmed. [[16723 旁白 sad]]
But then she heard Professor Su continue, "However, we have a theory. If her cells are continuously repairing her body and her temperature is gradually returning, while her skin remains active, could it be possible..." [[16724 苏教授 neutral]]
"...that her heart, which has stopped, might one day start beating again?" [[16725 苏教授 happy]]
Su Tao: "That's..." [[16726 苏桃 happy]]
"Doesn't it sound unbelievable?" Professor Su answered her own question. "I think so too, even if the probability is very, very small!" [[16727 苏教授 happy]]
Dongfang Yang was a bit more rational than Professor Su. They had already discussed this, and he said, [[16728 旁白 neutral]]
"According to the analysis of several of my expert professors, Chi Xiaocheng's current condition might be a form of suspended animation never before seen in medical history. It's different from common shock-induced suspended animation. When she was first admitted to the hospital, we learned that her cellular activity was unusually high." [[16729 东方阳 neutral]]
"It might be this very point that we overlooked, which has caused her body to undergo changes we've never seen before." [[16730 东方阳 neutral]]
"But this is a far-fetched explanation, with no scientific evidence, but..." [[16731 东方阳 neutral]]
But there was no other explanation. [[16732 旁白 neutral]]
Coming back from the dead was a bit terrifying. [[16733 旁白 neutral]]
Attributing it to a never-before-seen case of suspended animation was clearly more reasonable. [[16734 旁白 neutral]]
More importantly, Dongfang Yang didn't dare publicize this matter. [[16735 旁白 neutral]]
Except for Professor Su, the other professors who had seen Chi Xiaocheng were all his people. He wouldn't have let anyone else know if he didn't trust them completely. [[16736 旁白 neutral]]
Even Chi Xiaocheng's death had not been made public! [[16737 旁白 neutral]]
If such a miraculous event were discovered by the outside world, Chi Xiaocheng's "body" would never be allowed to remain in this hospital. [[16738 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Su Tao, who was on the verge of tears of joy, and smiled faintly. "Although it's a long shot, at least we have a glimmer of hope, just like we always said, right?" [[16739 东方阳 happy]]
Su Tao still held that small hand, feeling the warmth in it. [[16740 旁白 happy]]
Tears streamed down her face, one after another. [[16741 旁白 happy]]
The words "thank you" were muffled by her sobs. [[16742 旁白 happy]]
Professor Su patted Dongfang Yang's shoulder and gestured toward the door. [[16743 旁白 neutral]]
"You brought her here too early. We aren't even sure what Miss Chi's condition is. What if this is just giving her false hope..." [[16744 苏教授 sad]]
"Don't worry." Dongfang Yang closed the door, taking one last look at the two girls in the room. "The last time Si Chen was here, he detected a momentary change in her electrocardiogram. Maybe the machine wasn't broken after all." [[16745 东方阳 happy]]
"It's because of miracles like these that our lives are so full of color, isn't it?" [[16746 东方阳 happy]]
