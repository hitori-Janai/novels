Chapter 252: The Unusually Acting Tao-zi [[21454 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao wanted to ask, but she didn't dare, fearing it would cause unnecessary misunderstandings. [[21455 苏桃 neutral]]
In the past, before Ye Liang died and before she made up with Xiaocheng. [[21456 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, and Ye Liang had made an agreement to pursue her openly and honorably, without resorting to any dirty tricks. [[21457 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, she was a little flattered, but mostly felt helpless. [[21458 旁白 neutral]]
Her personality, coupled with some absurd thoughts that she inexplicably had at the time, made her unable to refuse their agreement. [[21459 旁白 neutral]]
For a long time, Su Tao believed that Dongfang Yang liked her. [[21460 旁白 neutral]]
Helping her so much was, in fact, his way of pursuing her. [[21461 旁白 neutral]]
But recently, she gradually sensed that Dongfang Yang's feelings were more like those of a brother towards his sister. [[21462 旁白 neutral]]
Very pure, very bright. [[21463 旁白 neutral]]
When someone is attracted to another person, with "carnal" intentions, it's obvious in their eyes. [[21464 旁白 neutral]]
The face, the body, the legs... these are just external things. The tone of voice and attitude would also be different. Having those thoughts would unconsciously drive all sorts of small actions. [[21465 旁白 neutral]]
But from Dongfang Yang, Su Tao only felt one thing—purity. [[21466 旁白 neutral]]
Just like his personality, what you see is what you get. [[21467 旁白 neutral]]
His gaze towards her, aside from a little doting, was one of admiration. [[21468 旁白 neutral]]
She gradually came to think that Dongfang Yang knew about her relationship with Xiaocheng, so he gave up on pursuing her and started treating her like a sister. [[21469 旁白 neutral]]
But now, it seemed that wasn't the case? [[21470 旁白 neutral]]
Could his feelings for her have changed because her rejection of him was actually quite obvious, and after shifting her focus to Xiaocheng, she had started treating him completely as a brother? [[21471 旁白 neutral]]
Knowing that she didn't like him anymore, he was gentlemanly enough not to insist, and instead... [[21472 旁白 neutral]]
He fell for Xiaocheng! [[21473 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao found it unlikely. She thought the possibility of Dongfang Yang seeing Chi Xiaocheng as a sister was infinitely large. [[21474 旁白 neutral]]
It was fine before she started thinking about it. [[21475 旁白 neutral]]
Now that the idea had sprouted in her mind, it grew uncontrollably. [[21476 旁白 neutral]]
He always called Xiaocheng a little idiot, a shorty. From another perspective, isn't that how a tsundere like Dongfang Yang would talk about someone he likes? [[21477 旁白 neutral]]
He clearly likes her a lot, yet he pretends to be awkward about it. [[21478 旁白 neutral]]
He was also very concerned about Xiaocheng, giving without asking for anything in return. When she once wanted to give up on Xiaocheng and cremate her, Dongfang Yang was even more insistent than she was! [[21479 旁白 neutral]]
Did he want Xiaocheng to be revived even more than she did? [[21480 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao wasn't sure. She vaguely felt that it was wrong for her to think this way. [[21481 旁白 neutral]]
But she couldn't help it, because the objective fact was right in front of her—his bank card's password was Xiaocheng's birthday. [[21482 旁白 neutral]]
This was irrefutable proof. [[21483 旁白 neutral]]
Phone passwords, lock screen wallpapers, bank card PINs... if it wasn't love, why would someone use another person's birthday? [[21484 旁白 neutral]]
A sense of crisis gradually welled up in Su Tao's heart. [[21485 旁白 neutral]]
Until Dongfang Yang called out to her, "Su Tao, what are you spacing out for?" [[21486 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly came back to her senses and said with a smile, "We don't need this money, Dongfang Yang. You should take it back." [[21487 苏桃 neutral]]
"How can I do that? This is specially for Chi Xiaocheng..." [[21488 东方阳 neutral]]
Before he could finish, Su Tao stuffed the bank card back into his hand and interrupted, "You've already helped us so much. If you also help us with money directly, Xiaocheng and I would be... really embarrassed." [[21489 苏桃 neutral]]
In the end, she couldn't find a better word to describe it. [[21490 旁白 neutral]]
But Dongfang Yang understood what Su Tao meant. [[21491 旁白 neutral]]
Many things change their nature when money gets involved. [[21492 旁白 neutral]]
And she, Su Tao, had never been interested in other people's money. It was precisely this "white moonlight" personality that had attracted him, Si Chen, and the others in the first place. [[21493 旁白 neutral]]
Right, a compensatory gift shouldn't be money. [[21494 旁白 neutral]]
He had been a bit rash, thinking that letting Chi Xiaocheng buy things herself was the simplest way. [[21495 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang reluctantly took back the bank card. "Alright then. But the things on these two streets nearby are quite expensive. If there's anything you want but can't afford, just let me know." [[21496 东方阳 neutral]]
"Okay!" [[21497 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao nodded, breathing a sigh of relief. [[21498 旁白 neutral]]
The next second, Chi Xiaocheng walked out of the dressing room and asked curiously, "What are you two talking about?" [[21499 池小橙 neutral]]
"Nothing." Su Tao immediately put on a smile, hiding their previous conversation. "I was just telling Dongfang Yang that we don't have to go to the banquet later, so Xiaocheng, I... we..." [[21500 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao pursed her lips and gathered her courage, "Should we go shopping together?" [[21501 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked and gave a cute smile, "Sure, but if I get tired, Sister Su Tao, you have to carry me." [[21502 池小橙 happy]]
With that smile, her cute little snaggletooth became slightly visible. [[21503 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, who knew Chi Xiaocheng well, knew that her little snaggletooth only became noticeable with her smile when she was genuinely happy. [[21504 旁白 neutral]]
Her resentment towards her had really disappeared. [[21505 旁白 neutral]]
Their relationship had also gotten better. [[21506 旁白 neutral]]
I'll just keep what happened with Dongfang Yang a secret from Xiaocheng. [[21507 旁白 neutral]]
I really don't want Xiaocheng to know that Dongfang Yang might like her. [[21508 旁白 neutral]]
This way, won't Xiaocheng belong only to me? [[21509 旁白 neutral]]
After a few more words of advice, Dongfang Yang left the room, leaving the two girls alone. [[21510 旁白 neutral]]
It was only then that Su Tao truly noticed Chi Xiaocheng's outfit. [[21511 旁白 neutral]]
A somewhat thick orange down jacket, paired with warm cotton pants and short boots, and a pink scarf. [[21512 旁白 neutral]]
Two ribbons tied her light brown hair into soft pigtails with a bit of a braided look. [[21513 旁白 neutral]]
She was already quite petite, and the thick down jacket made her look chubby and cute. [[21514 旁白 neutral]]
Something seems to be missing... [[21515 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's gaze fell on Chi Xiaocheng's bangs, and she realized that the orange hairpin she always used to wear was still at her house. [[21516 旁白 neutral]]
Saved as a "memento." [[21517 旁白 neutral]]
Such an accessory was like a personal trademark, and it was a gift from her to Xiaocheng. Su Tao really hoped Chi Xiaocheng would wear it forever. [[21518 旁白 neutral]]
As if she had put her personal mark on her. [[21519 旁白 neutral]]
Proving who she belonged to. [[21520 旁白 neutral]]
However, that hairpin was associated with bad memories. [[21521 旁白 neutral]]
Speeding in a car, being chased, jumping over a broken bridge, almost dying there. [[21522 旁白 neutral]]
Surviving a disaster should have been a wonderful thing, but at that moment, she had rejected Xiaocheng's confession. [[21523 旁白 neutral]]
The hairpin brought back fond memories for Su Tao. [[21524 旁白 neutral]]
But for Chi Xiaocheng, such memories might not be so beautiful. [[21525 旁白 neutral]]
Just like the question of whether to awaken her memories, the conflict still existed. [[21526 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, Xiaocheng was still cute! [[21527 旁白 neutral]]
Now that their relationship was better, her calling her "Sister Su Tao" still represented their closeness! [[21528 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao pushed aside her extra thoughts and asked Chi Xiaocheng, "Shall we go out for a walk now?" [[21529 苏桃 neutral]]
"Sure!" [[21530 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng came to Su Tao's side, and Su Tao felt the cold wind around her dissipate in that moment. [[21531 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze shifted to the slightly open window. The wind blew on Chi Xiaocheng, rustling her light brown hair. [[21532 旁白 neutral]]
Today, the wind was blowing from the right. [[21533 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's go." [[21534 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao opened the door for Chi Xiaocheng, and after Chi Xiaocheng stepped out of the room, she quickly moved to her right side. [[21535 旁白 neutral]]
They walked out of the house and into the courtyard. [[21536 旁白 neutral]]
She walked side by side with Chi Xiaocheng. [[21537 旁白 neutral]]
The cold wind lifted her brisk high ponytail. [[21538 旁白 neutral]]
