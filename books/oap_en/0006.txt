Chapter 6: Make Her Regret It for Life [[490 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, since your life is no longer in danger, why do you still maintain the yandere persona? You're not really a yandere." [[491 系统 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng post on her Moments, the System voiced its confusion. [[492 旁白 neutral]]
"This body might be a bit sickly and delicate, but I'm not really a yandere," Chi Xiaocheng said calmly. "However, the original owner angered most of the male leads. I need to strengthen that impression with Su Tao, so that no matter who we face, we won't be at a disadvantage as long as she's here." [[493 池小橙 neutral]]
"Besides, I've already left a deep impression on Su Tao. I need a good explanation for my actions these past few months to clear my name." [[494 池小橙 neutral]]
"Being paranoid, unhinged, and a yandere is a great excuse." [[495 池小橙 neutral]]
"For self-preservation?" [[496 系统 neutral]]
"Of course." [[497 池小橙 neutral]]
"But since we're safe now, why don't we just drop out of school and move to another city, or even fly abroad?" [[498 系统 neutral]]
After hearing the System's words, Chi Xiaocheng was stunned. [[499 旁白 neutral]]
"System, I thought you were a dummy, but I guess you're actually a genius." [[500 池小橙 happy]]
"However," Chi Xiaocheng tapped her chin, "I'm still not going to run. Maybe I just like seeking excitement." [[501 池小橙 neutral]]
A faintly charming smile appeared on her face, which even she didn't notice. [[502 旁白 neutral]]
In his previous life, just before being struck by a truck, he had just gone through a crisis. [[503 旁白 neutral]]
Two drug dealers, chased by undercover police, ran into the cafe he was in. With nowhere to go, one held a knife and the other a gun, taking everyone inside hostage. [[504 旁白 neutral]]
The dark barrel of the gun made everyone there tremble with fear. [[505 旁白 neutral]]
Only he felt a strange sense of thrill. [[506 旁白 neutral]]
He found a chance to get behind the gunman. Just as the man was about to harm a little girl, he seized the opportunity. [[507 旁白 neutral]]
He immediately tackled him, trying to snatch the gun and turn the tables. [[508 旁白 neutral]]
But to his surprise, the gun was a fake! [[509 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, the other criminal rushed towards him. [[510 旁白 neutral]]
The threat turned into a fight. He was just a college student who hadn't trained much; how could he be a match for the two of them? [[511 旁白 neutral]]
Before long, he was stabbed in the chest. [[512 旁白 sad]]
The burning pain didn't scare him; instead, it awoke his fierce side. [[513 旁白 neutral]]
He knew at that moment that he probably didn't desire a calm and boring life. [[514 旁白 neutral]]
Later, after leaving the hospital, he was walking along the road in a daze. He thought he saw a truck driver waving at him. [[515 旁白 neutral]]
And then, there was nothing after that. [[516 旁白 sad]]
The driver's score went up by one. [[517 旁白 neutral]]
"System, do you know how many types of yandere there are?" [[518 池小橙 neutral]]
"Aren't they all the same? Harming people, threatening others, just like what you just did, Host." [[519 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng shook her head gently with a faint smile. "A lot of people who don't get it think the same way you do. They think being a yandere is all about violence and wanting to be 'together forever,' but there are actually many types." [[520 池小橙 neutral]]
"Dependent, Possessive, Exclusionary, Aggressive, Stalker, Harmless, Worship, Delusional, and Isolation-Inducing." [[521 池小橙 neutral]]
In her past life, Chi Xiaocheng was a part-time novelist and had researched the topic extensively for her stories. [[522 旁白 neutral]]
She continued, "What I showed Su Tao before was the Possessive type, the kind that wants to make someone their property and trap them. But actually, the Dependent type will be more effective on Su Tao." [[523 池小橙 neutral]]
"I'll act like I depend on her for many things, like I can't live without her. With her 'pure-as-an-angel' personality, she would never stand by and watch me die." [[524 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's smile slowly turned wicked. "To win this game, I have to get a firm grip on Su Tao. I'll use this yandere personality as a start and then act more impulsive around her." [[525 池小橙 neutral]]
"I will unconditionally like her, support her, depend on her, protect her, and love her." [[526 池小橙 neutral]]
"Then I'll use the main and supporting characters to stage a few scenes, the kind where I get hurt in different ways while protecting her." [[527 池小橙 neutral]]
"It would be best if I could take a few stabs for her, end up in the hospital for a few months, and become partially disabled. Do you know what Su Tao would think then?" [[528 池小橙 neutral]]
"Wh-what?" [[529 系统 sad]]
The System's voice was trembling. [[530 旁白 neutral]]
"Guilt!" Chi Xiaocheng covered half her face, her eyes filled with anticipation. "I got hurt countless times for her, all because I liked her. And the reason I liked her is that she gave me hope I shouldn't have had!" [[531 池小橙 happy]]
"In other words, she's the reason I changed from a normal person into what I am today!" [[532 池小橙 happy]]
"As long as I make her realize this more and more, she'll feel endless guilt whenever I get hurt. Once it starts, she'll only sink deeper." [[533 池小橙 happy]]
"And if one day I die in front of her while protecting her, she will cry for three days and three nights and regret it for the rest of her life!" [[534 池小橙 happy]]
"It's a perfect script!" [[535 池小橙 happy]]
Of course, this was just a theoretical script. [[536 旁白 neutral]]
For now, she was still just a minor character who could be threatened by the male leads. [[537 旁白 neutral]]
But the System was still shocked by Chi Xiaocheng's idea. [[538 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, you were born to be a villain." [[539 系统 sad]]
"This is just what I have to do." [[540 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's expression returned to normal as she said flatly, "But this yandere personality is still a bit hard to manage. For now, I'll just take it one step at a time." [[541 池小橙 neutral]]
Actually, Chi Xiaocheng would rather play the Isolation-Inducing yandere. [[542 旁白 neutral]]
This type of yandere was the most terrifying of all! [[543 旁白 neutral]]
A girl with this yandere type has extremely strong love and possessiveness. [[544 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, she won't actively show her affection like other types. Instead, she spreads rumors around the person she likes, secretly driving a wedge between her beloved and their friends and family. [[545 旁白 neutral]]
When the person starts to think that everyone in the world has abandoned, doesn't care about, doesn't love, and dislikes them, the Isolation-Inducing yandere makes her move. [[546 旁白 neutral]]
She appears with the perfect image of a gentle and harmless angel. [[547 旁白 neutral]]
She is the only one who supports, loves, and embraces him, making him emotionally dependent on her. Over time, he comes to rely on her completely and falls deeply in love with her. [[548 旁白 neutral]]
This type of yandere is very good at hiding herself. [[549 旁白 neutral]]
By the time you realize what's happening, you're already in her arms with no way to escape. [[550 旁白 neutral]]
But in her current situation, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't play such a role. [[551 旁白 neutral]]
If she had arrived a few years earlier, she was confident she could have isolated Su Tao into a "girl hated by the world" with only her as a friend. [[552 旁白 neutral]]
And as Chi Xiaocheng's thoughts wandered, her phone buzzed with notifications. [[553 旁白 neutral]]
Someone had replied to the Moments post she had just made. [[554 旁白 neutral]]
