Chapter 181: The Feeling of Liking Someone is Happiness and Enjoyment [[15805 旁白 neutral]]
A familiar story, but with a completely unfamiliar person. [[15806 旁白 neutral]]
A possessiveness that made it hard to breathe, a desire for control so strong it was impossible to ignore, never satisfied even when they were together, and a crazy, heavy love given to the other person. [[15807 旁白 neutral]]
Could this boy's girlfriend really be happy with such a twisted kind of love? [[15808 苏桃 neutral]]
It might have been fine when he was just pursuing her, before they were together. [[15809 苏桃 neutral]]
But after they got together, she constantly had to deal with his confessions and declarations of love. He cared so much that she had no personal space. He wanted to be with her every free moment, believing she was the only one in his life. [[15810 苏桃 sad]]
He even wanted you to only love him. [[15811 苏桃 sad]]
It was like seeing another version of Xiaocheng and herself. [[15812 苏桃 sad]]
However, Wei Feng was just an ordinary person who was a little bit paranoid. [[15813 苏桃 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng was a complete yandere. [[15814 苏桃 neutral]]
But as the ones being confessed to, loved, and pressured, both she and his girlfriend had the same reaction. [[15815 苏桃 sad]]
They felt confused, found it hard to accept, and even felt scared and burdened. [[15816 苏桃 sad]]
So, I'm not the only one who feels this way, right? [[15817 苏桃 sad]]
Xiaocheng was the same. Her love was so heavy it was hard to breathe. [[15818 苏桃 sad]]
"I think..." [[15819 韦峰 sad]]
Wei Feng's words brought Su Tao's attention back. "I think she must have liked me at some point, right?" [[15820 韦峰 sad]]
Su Tao opened her mouth slightly. "But you said she broke up with you because she couldn't stand your pushy way of loving her. So how could she have liked you?" [[15821 苏桃 neutral]]
Wei Feng laughed. "What you said is a bit hard to hear, but since I'm about to die, I won't get angry with you." [[15822 韦峰 neutral]]
"Well, this is what I think." [[15823 韦峰 neutral]]
A light breeze blew through his hair and rustled the young man's clothes. [[15824 旁白 neutral]]
"When she was with me, she had a very happy and joyful smile. Isn't that proof that she liked me?" [[15825 韦峰 sad]]
Su Tao looked a bit dazed. "Liking someone... is it like that?" [[15826 苏桃 neutral]]
"I think so. If she didn't like me, why would she want to be by my side, why would she dream about me when she slept, and why would she smile?" [[15827 韦峰 sad]]
"It's just that she never told me about my flaws. After we argued, she would only reflect on herself and never point out my shortcomings." [[15828 韦峰 sad]]
"Gradually, I pushed her more and more, and then..." [[15829 韦峰 sad]]
"Snap!" [[15830 旁白 neutral]]
Wei Feng clapped his hands, making a sharp sound. "A balloon can't hold that much air, so it popped." [[15831 韦峰 sad]]
"But actually, if she had told me my flaws, I would have changed. I would have become the person she wanted me to be, because I loved her." [[15832 韦峰 sad]]
"It's a shame. You only think of these things after it's too late and you're full of regret. If I had been a little more mature, she wouldn't have left me." [[15833 韦峰 sad]]
Wei Feng gave a bitter, self-mocking laugh and turned to Su Tao. "What about you, miss? Why do you want to jump into the river?" [[15834 韦峰 sad]]
"I..." [[15835 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao opened her mouth, her mind still echoing with what Wei Feng had just said. [[15836 旁白 neutral]]
When they were together, there were happy smiles, enjoyment, and comfort. That was their love. [[15837 苏桃 neutral]]
If she had pointed out his flaws, he would have changed. [[15838 苏桃 neutral]]
Because he loved her. [[15839 苏桃 neutral]]
Thinking about it carefully, was Xiaocheng like that too? [[15840 苏桃 sad]]
Once, she had wished for Xiaocheng to be a bit more "good." For half a month, she didn't show any yandere tendencies and was like a little kitten at home. [[15841 苏桃 sad]]
She would soothe her fatigue at the end of each day and listen to her complain about work or school. [[15842 苏桃 sad]]
Whenever she looked over, the perceptive Xiaocheng would sense her gaze and turn to give her a smile. [[15843 苏桃 happy]]
When their eyes met, her smile would naturally heal her and fill her with joy. [[15844 苏桃 happy]]
But back then, she didn't know how to cherish it. She thought Xiaocheng was getting back to normal, so she could focus on other things. [[15845 苏桃 sad]]
Wasn't this her own fault? [[15846 苏桃 sad]]
When they broke up, was it the boy's fault? Was it his immaturity? [[15847 苏桃 sad]]
She had never dared to talk to Xiaocheng about her yandere side. [[15848 苏桃 sad]]
If she had realized she wasn't normal earlier, would she have cooperated with treatment? [[15849 苏桃 sad]]
Then she wouldn't have to hide from her. Even with her yandere tendencies, she could have stayed by her side, and she would have been happy and not acted out. [[15850 苏桃 sad]]
After all, she loved her so much. [[15851 苏桃 sad]]
After all, she always listened to her. [[15852 苏桃 sad]]
It was never Xiaocheng's fault, it was mine... [[15853 苏桃 sad]]
Ever since their argument during summer break, she had never had an honest talk with Xiaocheng. [[15854 苏桃 sad]]
The only time was the day she died protecting her. [[15855 苏桃 sad]]
At the very end of everything, she... argued with her. [[15856 苏桃 sad]]
Argued with her! [[15857 苏桃 angry]]
She couldn't even hear her confession! [[15858 苏桃 sad]]
Even as she was dying, as she was leaving. [[15859 苏桃 sad]]
At the very farewell. [[15860 苏桃 sad]]
The very, very end. [[15861 苏桃 sad]]
She left her forever with regrets, her wish unfulfilled. [[15862 苏桃 sad]]
The memory was covered by the vast snow. Wei Feng, seeing Su Tao silent for a long time, called out in surprise, "Miss?" [[15863 韦峰 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly came back to her senses and forced a smile. "I'm fine, I was just thinking about her." [[15864 苏桃 sad]]
"Heartbroken, just like me?" [[15865 韦峰 sad]]
Su Tao nodded. [[15866 苏桃 sad]]
The young man sighed. "I never thought I'd meet a kindred spirit about to jump into the river. You can say what's on your mind. It's better to have someone to listen, and I'll take your words to the grave. No one will know." [[15867 韦峰 sad]]
Perhaps she really had been holding it in for too long, or maybe she was looking for an answer. [[15868 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao turned her head. Darkness and snow were in front of her, and she couldn't see the young man's face clearly, but she still asked, "Do you know what a yandere is?" [[15869 苏桃 neutral]]
"I do." Wei Feng was also a fan of anime. "Did you fall in love with a yandere, or did a yandere fall in love with you?" [[15870 韦峰 neutral]]
"The second one." [[15871 苏桃 neutral]]
"The second one, huh? A yandere's heavy love isn't something most people can handle, but I'm actually a bit envious of you." [[15872 韦峰 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at him with surprise. "Envious?" [[15873 苏桃 neutral]]
"Yeah." Wei Feng leaned against the railing. "A love like that is completely loyal." [[15874 韦峰 neutral]]
"But isn't it a lot of pressure?" [[15875 苏桃 sad]]
Wei Feng tilted his head. "Why would you feel pressured?" [[15876 韦峰 neutral]]
"I..." Su Tao's voice was low. "I think... it's terrifying that she often hurts herself and hurts others over small things." [[15877 苏桃 sad]]
"Just like your girlfriend felt that your need for control and possession was too strong, which is why she broke up with you, right?" [[15878 苏桃 sad]]
Wei Feng: "That's because she was just playing around with me, but I wanted to spend my whole life with her. We wanted different things, so we couldn't connect." [[15879 韦峰 sad]]
"But it's undeniable that for a while, she was very happy by my side." [[15880 韦峰 happy]]
"Don't just think about the stressful and scary things. If you're already planning to jump, why think about the bad stuff?" [[15881 韦峰 neutral]]
"A walk down memory lane is for remembering the beautiful things, the things you cherish." [[15882 韦峰 neutral]]
Wei Feng's voice drifted to Su Tao's ears through the wind and snow. "Clear your mind. When she was by your side, did you not feel any happiness or enjoyment at all?" [[15883 韦峰 neutral]]
"Yanderes aren't scary. They seem scary because they're insecure, so they do extreme things. But no matter how extreme her actions are, they're all for you, because she loves you." [[15884 韦峰 neutral]]
"Just like how I was insecure, so I subconsciously pressured my ex-girlfriend." [[15885 韦峰 sad]]
"But when you hold her hand, and your eyes are only for her." [[15886 韦峰 neutral]]
"As a yandere, she is very obedient and very cute." [[15887 韦峰 happy]]
His words came with a gust of wind that blew her long, dark hair. [[15888 旁白 neutral]]
It also carried away the glistening tears from the corners of the young woman's eyes. [[15889 旁白 neutral]]
