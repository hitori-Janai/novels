Chapter 198: The Scarecrow Incident [[17332 旁白 neutral]]
"A ghost... there's a ghost!" [[17333 陌生男1 sad]]
The guy who had been hitting on her looked terrified. He scrambled backward on his hands, and his loud shout drew everyone's attention. [[17334 旁白 neutral]]
Before some of the Si family members could get angry, Chu Lingfeng had already strode over. [[17335 旁白 neutral]]
He grabbed the guy and demanded loudly, "What nonsense are you talking about? Today is Old Master Si's 73rd birthday. Even the Grim Reaper would have to offer a cigarette if he showed up!" [[17336 楚凌风 angry]]
The guy noticed the guests looking at him and lowered his head in shame. [[17337 旁白 neutral]]
He was just about to apologize. [[17338 旁白 neutral]]
When he happened to glance over at Chi Xiaocheng. [[17339 旁白 neutral]]
The scarecrow's expression had changed again. Its mouth was slightly open, and its body swayed in the wind, making the doll seem to float in mid-air. [[17340 旁白 neutral]]
But no matter how it was blown about, its face, with its crimson vertical pupils, remained fixed on the guy. [[17341 旁白 neutral]]
And, of course, on Chu Lingfeng. [[17342 旁白 neutral]]
The fear he had suppressed moments ago now overcame his shame. [[17343 旁白 neutral]]
The guy pointed at the scarecrow doll and screamed as if he were having a breakdown, "The ghost... the ghost is right there, look for yourselves!" [[17344 陌生男1 sad]]
All the guests looked toward the person he was pointing at. [[17345 旁白 neutral]]
They wouldn't notice the doll hanging from her waist like an ornament. [[17346 旁白 neutral]]
They only saw the person, Su Tao. [[17347 旁白 neutral]]
An invisible pressure came from all around, making Su Tao's heart tighten. She took a step back. [[17348 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng, who was looking for a chance to talk to Su Tao, immediately yelled at the guy, "Say that again and I'll have you thrown out! She's Young Master Dongfang's sister, and you're calling her a ghost?" [[17349 楚凌风 angry]]
He added, pointing emphatically, "Can a ghost be this beautiful?!" [[17350 楚凌风 angry]]
But the guy wasn't scared off. He kept shouting, "It's the scarecrow! Look at the scarecrow, that's the ghost!" [[17351 陌生男1 sad]]
"Nonsense!" [[17352 楚凌风 angry]]
Chu Lingfeng threw the guy to the ground. "Security! Get him out of here!" [[17353 楚凌风 angry]]
After that, he started to reassure the other guests. [[17354 旁白 neutral]]
Acting just like the man of the house. [[17355 旁白 neutral]]
After doing all this, he turned to Su Tao. His first instinct was to look at the little doll on her waist. [[17356 旁白 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[17357 楚凌风 neutral]]
Where's the doll? [[17358 楚凌风 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng was surprised to find that the doll had disappeared from Su Tao, and only the ribbon that had tied it to her was still hanging from her waist. [[17359 旁白 neutral]]
Did it get blown away by the wind? [[17360 楚凌风 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng didn't think much of it and decided to ask a guest next to him, "Hey brother, he kept talking about a doll. Did you see where it went?" [[17361 楚凌风 neutral]]
The guest asked back, confused, "What are you talking about? Did that beautiful lady have a doll on her?" [[17362 陌生人 neutral]]
"Huh?" [[17363 楚凌风 neutral]]
Watching the guest leave, Chu Lingfeng couldn't help but feel a little puzzled. [[17364 旁白 neutral]]
Could I have really been mistaken? [[17365 楚凌风 neutral]]
But I definitely saw it when we were at the villa's entrance. [[17366 楚凌风 neutral]]
How strange. [[17367 楚凌风 neutral]]
He looked at Su Tao again and decided not to bother with such a small detail. [[17368 旁白 neutral]]
He wanted to win over Su Tao while Dongfang Yang, Si Chen, and that annoying Qian Qing were not around. [[17369 旁白 neutral]]
At the very least, he had to get her contact information. [[17370 旁白 neutral]]
He adjusted his collar, put on a confident smile, and walked over. "Miss Su Tao, are you alright? I'm very sorry about that madman bothering you." [[17371 楚凌风 happy]]
Su Tao came back to her senses and gave a polite smile, "I'm fine, thank you for your concern, Divine Doctor Chu." [[17372 苏桃 happy]]
Her voice was like a spring breeze, and Chu Lingfeng enjoyed it. Before he could speak, he heard Su Tao ask another question, "Divine Doctor Chu, that thing you do... the thirty needles... can it really bring people back from the dead?" [[17373 苏桃 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng coughed awkwardly. "It's the Taiyi Thirteen Needles." [[17374 楚凌风 neutral]]
"Oh, sorry, I didn't remember the name." [[17375 苏桃 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng waved his hand dismissively and started to brag, "Miss Su Tao, you don't know how powerful my thirteen needles are. Just before..." [[17376 楚凌风 happy]]
He glanced around cautiously and lowered his voice, "Si Zhenliu had one foot in the grave, but I still managed to save him." [[17377 楚凌风 happy]]
"And this is the power of Chu Lingfeng!" [[17378 楚凌风 happy]]
Su Tao heard this and got a little excited, "So it can bring people back from the dead, right?" [[17379 苏桃 happy]]
"Well..." Chu Lingfeng didn't dare to make such a bold claim. "If they aren't completely dead, I can give it a try. But if they're really dead, I can't do it." [[17380 楚凌风 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao couldn't help but think of Chi Xiaocheng's condition. [[17381 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng's condition... she shouldn't be considered completely dead, right? [[17382 苏桃 neutral]]
After all, both Dongfang Yang and Professor Su said there was hope for her to wake up. [[17383 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she was about to speak, she noticed Chu Lingfeng looking around and asked, "What's... what's wrong?" [[17384 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's nothing." Chu Lingfeng looked down again, but couldn't resist asking, "Miss Su Tao, do you feel a bit of a chill on your neck? The windows don't seem to be open, and the air conditioning is on heat." [[17385 楚凌风 neutral]]
"Well..." [[17386 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't understand what Chu Lingfeng was doing. "I don't feel anything like that." [[17387 苏桃 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng shook his head forcefully, as if trying to shake off the feeling. [[17388 旁白 neutral]]
But just as he opened his mouth to continue talking to Su Tao. [[17389 旁白 neutral]]
The feeling became stronger. [[17390 旁白 neutral]]
He sucked in a cold breath, suddenly terrified. [[17391 旁白 neutral]]
He stood up without caring about his image, subconsciously covering his Adam's apple with his finger. Only then did he realize the hairs on his arms were standing on end. [[17392 旁白 neutral]]
He had studied martial arts, though he wasn't as skilled as those monstrous ancient martial artists. [[17393 旁白 neutral]]
But he was much stronger than an ordinary person. [[17394 旁白 neutral]]
His perception of his surroundings was even sharper. [[17395 旁白 neutral]]
This feeling of being watched was undoubtedly some kind of killing intent! [[17396 旁白 neutral]]
I haven't made any enemies in the last two months. [[17397 楚凌风 neutral]]
Could it be that someone is jealous of my current power and status? [[17398 楚凌风 neutral]]
Or perhaps, other families want to assassinate me! [[17399 楚凌风 neutral]]
He looked around warily and suddenly noticed a flash of red light in a corner. [[17400 旁白 neutral]]
His heart leaped, and he instantly locked onto that direction. [[17401 旁白 neutral]]
That feeling of fear was coming from there. [[17402 旁白 neutral]]
What was that just now? [[17403 楚凌风 neutral]]
Something like an infrared light? [[17404 楚凌风 neutral]]
Just then, Chu Lingfeng suddenly heard Su Tao ask in confusion, "Huh? Where's my little doll? It's gone. When did it fall off?" [[17405 苏桃 neutral]]
"Doll... red light..." [[17406 楚凌风 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng's heart skipped a beat. He immediately remembered the strange scarecrow doll at the villa entrance that had left a deep impression on him. [[17407 旁白 neutral]]
And also the guy who seemed to have gone mad just now. [[17408 旁白 neutral]]
He swallowed, feeling inexplicably guilty. [[17409 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be... that ghosts really exist in this world? [[17410 楚凌风 sad]]
Haha, it must be my imagination. How could there be ghosts? [[17411 楚凌风 happy]]
But the more he thought like this, the deeper he fell into the trap, and his denial slowly turned into self-reassurance. [[17412 旁白 neutral]]
Until, in a corner of the banquet, the guy who had been staring at Su Tao with a lecherous gaze let out a scream. [[17413 旁白 neutral]]
"Ghost—!!!" [[17414 陌生男2 sad]]
When one person thinks there's a ghost, some people just think he's crazy. [[17415 旁白 neutral]]
But what about two people, three people, or even many people? [[17416 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng felt his hands and feet turn cold, and the feeling of being watched grew stronger. [[17417 旁白 neutral]]
He suddenly turned his head to look in a specific direction. [[17418 旁白 neutral]]
A small doll was sitting far away, watching him. [[17419 旁白 neutral]]
However, it was as if a voice echoed in his ear. [[17420 旁白 neutral]]
"Are you looking for me?" [[17421 池小橙 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng quickly turned around, as if he saw a little girl in a hood and holding a knife float by. [[17422 旁白 neutral]]
Hooded Xiaocheng (AI) [[17423 旁白 neutral]]
