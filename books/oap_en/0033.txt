Chapter 33: Stepping on a Landmine [[2798 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia leaned against the wall, watching Chi Xiaocheng with a teasing look. She played with her phone while kicking the companion squatting beside her. [[2799 旁白 neutral]]
The follower, wearing black-rimmed glasses with her hair down, froze. With a gloomy expression, she quickly put her phone away. [[2800 旁白 neutral]]
She stood up, head bowed, and stared blankly at Chi Xiaocheng. [[2801 旁白 neutral]]
Her sinister gaze made people even more afraid of Liu Guijia, the one in charge. [[2802 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng composed herself and pulled her hoodie down, covering the top half of her face. Her red eyes glowed faintly in the shadow of the hood. [[2803 旁白 neutral]]
When facing bullies like them, the weaker you act, the more they take advantage. [[2804 旁白 neutral]]
Knowing this, Chi Xiaocheng timidly walked toward Liu Guijia. [[2805 旁白 neutral]]
With her head lowered and a strand of hair peeking out from her hood, she held out a small hand and said nervously, "Money... give me my money back..." [[2806 池小橙 sad]]
Liu Guijia chuckled. [[2807 旁白 neutral]]
She was about to snap back with a sarcastic comment but was quickly pulled back by her follower. [[2808 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia turned her head, annoyed. "What are you doing?" [[2809 刘桂嘉 angry]]
The follower pointed to a corner of the hallway where a red light was glowing. [[2810 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia's pupils narrowed, and her tense shoulders relaxed. She pointed to the door and said, "Since you're here, why not invite us in? It's freezing outside. The snow is late this year, and it will be snowing in a few days. Isn't it too cold?" [[2811 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
As she spoke, both she and her follower stepped away from the door. [[2812 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at a camera in the hallway. It was installed by the property management, and every floor had a few to prevent any incidents. [[2813 旁白 neutral]]
It would have been perfect if they had started something right there. [[2814 旁白 neutral]]
But it didn't matter. Chu San would come find her because of the handkerchief anyway. [[2815 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng opened the door and walked in. After Liu Guijia and her follower were inside, she pushed the door almost closed, leaving a small crack. [[2816 旁白 neutral]]
Once inside, Liu Guijia carelessly opened the refrigerator, grabbed a bottle of Coke, and plopped down on the sofa as if she owned the place. [[2817 旁白 neutral]]
She crossed her legs and remarked, "It's incredible. We both come from poor backgrounds, so why do you have such a nice house in such a great location?" [[2818 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said nothing, simply watching her open the Coke and take a drink. [[2819 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she slowly walked in front of her, lifted her head, and asked, "Can you return my money now?" [[2820 池小橙 neutral]]
"Heh." Liu Guijia turned to look down at Chi Xiaocheng. "Sure, how much do you want me to pay back?" [[2821 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng bit her lip, and her timid expression was reflected in Liu Guijia's eyes. "Three... three years. Not counting middle school... you... you just need to give me back seven thousand!" [[2822 池小橙 sad]]
Liu Guijia sighed. "Seven thousand, huh? I didn't even realize I had taken that much from you." [[2823 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
Even she found it hard to believe. [[2824 旁白 neutral]]
After all, Chi Xiaocheng was just as poor as her. Her family couldn't even afford her tuition, and she only knew that her brother, who was out making a living, was the one giving her money. [[2825 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at Chi Xiaocheng with a sneer. "Pay you back?" [[2826 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked shocked and took a step back in fear. "What... what do you mean? Are you not going to pay me back? You said you would!" [[2827 池小橙 sad]]
"Ha!" Liu Guijia covered her mouth with her thumb and forefinger, trying to hold back her laughter. [[2828 旁白 neutral]]
Then she put her hand on her forehead, pushed up her bangs, and burst out laughing. "Hahahaha, you're actually asking me for money?!" [[2829 刘桂嘉 happy]]
"Hahahaha, are you trying to kill me with laughter?" She raised her head and a fist, asking rhetorically, "When did you get the guts to defy me? Who gave you the courage?" [[2830 刘桂嘉 happy]]
"Was it Liang Jingru?" [[2831 刘桂嘉 happy]]
A sharp cry rang out. [[2832 旁白 neutral]]
"Bang—!" [[2833 旁白 neutral]]
A heavy punch landed on Chi Xiaocheng's face. [[2834 旁白 neutral]]
The force of the blow sent a gust of wind that blew back Chi Xiaocheng's hood. She fell to the ground, tumbling twice before hitting a chair. [[2835 旁白 neutral]]
The blow was heavy, and her face hurt a lot. [[2836 旁白 neutral]]
Even with reduced pain sensitivity, Chi Xiaocheng's face burned. The pain was no less than the self-inflicted injuries from her plan. [[2837 旁白 neutral]]
But... it was bearable. [[2838 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't let anger cloud her mind; the pain made her more rational. [[2839 旁白 neutral]]
All she had to do was wait for Chu San to bring the handkerchief. The harder Liu Guijia hit her, the more credible her reason for "becoming a yandere due to bullying and self-harm" would be. [[2840 旁白 neutral]]
This punch was also part of the plan, so there was no need to be angry. [[2841 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was very clear-headed. The moment she looked up, her calm eyes became nervous, fearful, and delicate, her lips trembling uncontrollably. "You... how could you do this!" [[2842 池小橙 sad]]
She held her cheek and tasted something salty in her mouth. [[2843 旁白 neutral]]
The punch had made her mouth bleed. [[2844 旁白 neutral]]
This taste was really unpleasant. [[2845 旁白 neutral]]
A demonic glint flashed in her eyes. Seeing Liu Guijia stand up, Chi Xiaocheng's body began to tremble slightly. [[2846 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if her past fears were flooding back. [[2847 旁白 neutral]]
The girl flicked her yellow hair and walked toward Chi Xiaocheng. "Honestly, I never thought you'd dare ask for your money back. This is perfect." [[2848 刘桂嘉 angry]]
She crouched down in front of Chi Xiaocheng. [[2849 旁白 neutral]]
She grabbed a handful of her brown hair. [[2850 旁白 neutral]]
Yanking her head up, she said, "You've been hiding from me for half a month. It's time to remind you who's the boss." [[2851 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Slap—!" [[2852 旁白 neutral]]
Another slap landed on Chi Xiaocheng's face. The soft feeling and crisp sound on her palm made Liu Guijia frown. [[2853 旁白 neutral]]
At this point, Chi Xiaocheng should be crying and begging her to stop. [[2854 旁白 neutral]]
What's with this calm reaction? [[2855 旁白 neutral]]
Is she looking down on me? [[2856 旁白 neutral]]
And this face... [[2857 旁白 neutral]]
"Tsk!" [[2858 旁白 neutral]]
She slapped her again. "Always this face, always this face! Why do you get to be so beautiful and have a delicate look that everyone likes, why!" [[2859 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Zing—" [[2860 旁白 neutral]]
She pulled a small knife from her lower back, held it to Chi Xiaocheng's face, and sneered, "Chi Xiaocheng, what do you think would happen if I scarred your face?" [[2861 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's pupils shrank, fear showing on her face, and she shook her head, trying to struggle. [[2862 池小橙 sad]]
Seeing this, Liu Guijia's face finally showed a satisfied expression. She said to the follower behind her, "You, go check if the windows are closed. It would be bad if she screamed." [[2863 刘桂嘉 neutral]]
The follower was squatting on the floor, leaning against the sofa, knees bent, arms wrapped around herself, trembling as if she were experiencing the same abuse as Chi Xiaocheng. [[2864 旁白 neutral]]
Noticing no movement behind her, Liu Guijia frowned with displeasure and said sharply, "What, didn't you hear me?" [[2865 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Ye... yes!" [[2866 陌生女1 sad]]
The follower nodded and hurried to the large open window on the balcony. [[2867 旁白 neutral]]
Liu Guijia watched with satisfaction, then turned back to Chi Xiaocheng. "See that? You should be just like her, not daring to glare at me." [[2868 刘桂嘉 angry]]
She didn't notice the calmness hidden in Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. The cold back of the blade slid across her cheek as Liu Guijia delivered her victor's speech, "I'm also curious. After training you for three years, how have you not become a dog? Who gave you hope?" [[2869 刘桂嘉 angry]]
Her eyes shifted, thinking. [[2870 旁白 neutral]]
They finally landed on a photo of two people under the TV. [[2871 旁白 neutral]]
She sneered, "Was it that bitch, Su Tao?" [[2872 刘桂嘉 angry]]
"Bang—!" [[2873 旁白 neutral]]
A small hand tightly gripped Liu Guijia's wrist. A pair of red pupils contracted, like a cat protecting its food. [[2874 旁白 neutral]]
"Say that again and see what happens." [[2875 池小橙 angry]]
