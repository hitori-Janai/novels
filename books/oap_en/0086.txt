Chapter 86: Taotao, You're So Innocent [[7498 旁白 neutral]]
A game? [[7499 池小橙 neutral]]
What kind of game? A new one? [[7500 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew this was Su Tao's subtle way of distracting her. [[7501 旁白 neutral]]
In reality, Su Tao didn't usually play games, so she wasn't talking about anything on a computer. [[7502 旁白 neutral]]
But she still put on a happy smile, her eyes filled with the joyful and possessive desire of seeing a new toy. [[7503 旁白 neutral]]
"What game do you want to play, Taotao? Rock-paper-scissors?" [[7504 池小橙 happy]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng's cute smile, Su Tao couldn't help but swallow nervously, feeling a bit scared. [[7505 旁白 neutral]]
Behind that sweet smile was a terrifying yandere. [[7506 旁白 neutral]]
Suppressing her panic, Su Tao said cautiously, "It's not rock-paper-scissors. I'm going to talk about certain things and people, and you have to promise me you won't get angry." [[7507 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay!" [[7508 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded eagerly, swaying her body slightly as if she were very happy. [[7509 旁白 happy]]
Then she sat down obediently. "Go ahead, Taotao." [[7510 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao took a deep breath, her expression turning serious, and then said, "Actually... Si Chen has been secretly messaging me, wanting to ask me out." [[7511 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's smile vanished, and her pupils turned a deep red. "Oh? So Si Chen likes Taotao that much. I'll go have a little chat with him." [[7512 池小橙 angry]]
The sudden change made Su Tao break out in a cold sweat. "Wait, Xiaocheng! Didn't I tell you? You have to listen to me, or I'll be upset." [[7513 苏桃 sad]]
"I see..." Chi Xiaocheng's eyes seemed to grow vacant, and her voice turned flat. "So Taotao cares more about Si Chen. You'd get upset with me for him..." [[7514 池小橙 sad]]
"No... that's not it!" Su Tao grabbed Chi Xiaocheng's hand and leaned in anxiously. "I meant, it's just a game! I was just saying that. It doesn't mean Si Chen really contacted me. Actually, Si Chen kind of likes you, so he asked me to see if you like him!" [[7515 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's mind was racing, and her words were becoming a bit incoherent, but Chi Xiaocheng showed no signs of returning to normal. [[7516 旁白 neutral]]
How could she have such a strong reaction to just one sentence! [[7517 苏桃 neutral]]
How does Xiaocheng slip into this yandere state so easily? There was no warning at all! [[7518 苏桃 neutral]]
Right... Dr. Cheng mentioned a way to handle this. [[7519 苏桃 neutral]]
She had asked, "If Xiaocheng is about to enter that strange yandere state, how can I stop her?" [[7520 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "If she enters that state, something must have triggered her. It could be a word, an action, or even a look. When she's in what you call a yandere state, it's like she's sealed off her heart, and it's very hard to snap her out of it." [[7521 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "At that moment, as the person she likes, you should shower her with praise. Make her feel your affection, and her emotions will change, preventing her from entering that dark state." [[7522 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao: "What... what if that doesn't work?" [[7523 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Don't worry about 'what ifs.' If all else fails, just tickle her. She can't turn dark if she's laughing too hard to move." [[7524 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Is... is that a real therapy method?" [[7525 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "What do you know? This is a therapy method straight out of the 2D world!" [[7526 成医生 neutral]]
Considering the 2D world, that actually sounded somewhat logical. [[7527 旁白 neutral]]
But at the time, Su Tao hadn't taken it seriously. [[7528 旁白 neutral]]
Now... it seemed like this was her only option, right? [[7529 旁白 neutral]]
After their interaction, Chi Xiaocheng was no longer in that dark, yandere state. [[7530 旁白 neutral]]
Her slightly narrowed eyes held a hint of a smile. [[7531 旁白 neutral]]
--Haha, Taotao is so innocent. Just by pretending to be a yandere, she became so proactive. [[7532 池小橙 happy]]
Su Tao, on the other hand, felt a mix of enjoyment and conflict, constantly apologizing to suppress certain feelings. [[7533 旁白 neutral]]
--Sob, Xiaocheng, I'm sorry. I'm only pretending to like you, yet I'm still doing things like this. [[7534 苏桃 sad]]
Both had their own thoughts, but what they had in common was that they were both enjoying each other's company. [[7535 旁白 neutral]]
After a long while, Su Tao brushed her hair back and turned her head to the side. [[7536 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't dare to meet Chi Xiaocheng's eyes. "Sorry, Xiaocheng, I... I..." [[7537 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's heart was in turmoil. [[7538 旁白 neutral]]
How could she explain that she was trying to stop Xiaocheng from going dark? [[7539 旁白 neutral]]
In her panic, Su Tao blurted out, "I... I wasn't paying attention." [[7540 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at her with a smile. "If you weren't paying attention, then... maybe you should pay more attention?" [[7541 池小橙 happy]]
Her crimson eyes had lost their demonic look from before she went dark and were now as gentle as water. [[7542 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao froze for a moment, at a loss for what to do. [[7543 旁白 neutral]]
She instinctively turned her head towards the door to escape, only to find a nurse standing there. [[7544 旁白 neutral]]
The nurse wore a mask, but her slightly narrowed eyes made it almost certain she was smiling like a doting aunt. [[7545 旁白 neutral]]
Meeting Su Tao's gaze, the nurse waved her hand. "I'm just passing by, you two continue. The regular rooms don't have cameras, so don't worry~" [[7546 护士小姐 happy]]
The nurse said with a smile in her eyes and kindly closed the door for them. [[7547 旁白 neutral]]
Before leaving, she even hung a "Resting, Do Not Disturb" sign on the door. [[7548 旁白 neutral]]
This whole series of actions left Su Tao feeling both embarrassed and shy. [[7549 旁白 neutral]]
She had been nervously trying to handle Chi Xiaocheng. [[7550 旁白 neutral]]
Now, the tips of her ears turned red. She covered her face, not even daring to look back at Chi Xiaocheng. [[7551 旁白 neutral]]
As the one who had started the yandere act, Chi Xiaocheng naturally looked calm and composed. [[7552 旁白 neutral]]
After spending so much time with Su Tao, this was the first time Chi Xiaocheng had seen her so shy. [[7553 旁白 happy]]
So cute. [[7554 池小橙 happy]]
Shyness is good. Shyness means her heart is moved, and if her heart is moved, can love be far behind? [[7555 池小橙 happy]]
Half a month ago, Su Tao probably wouldn't have developed any feelings of affection no matter what. [[7556 旁白 neutral]]
Taotao, love happens without you even realizing it. [[7557 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't rush to speak, but quietly waited for Su Tao to calm down. [[7558 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was strong-willed; otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to handle the constant pressure. It took her about 30 seconds to compose herself. [[7559 旁白 neutral]]
Although her pretty face was still slightly flushed, her voice had calmed down. "Xiaocheng, let's get back to our earlier topic. You... you have to listen to me, okay?" [[7560 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay~" [[7561 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat obediently. [[7562 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that her "flower kiss therapy" was working and that Chi Xiaocheng was not only obedient but also listening, Su Tao breathed a sigh of relief. [[7563 旁白 happy]]
She continued slowly, "Actually... it wasn't that dramatic. Si Chen asked me out to discuss some school matters." [[7564 苏桃 neutral]]
Her goal was only to control the extent of Chi Xiaocheng's yandere state. [[7565 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng blinked and nodded without much reaction. [[7566 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was pleased and continued, "Also, Dongfang Yang also asked me out and... and wanted to give me a gift." [[7567 苏桃 neutral]]
She glanced at Chi Xiaocheng, who seemed a little unhappy, so Su Tao immediately reached out and took her small hand. [[7568 旁白 neutral]]
It was small and soft, with a texture like a fine gummy candy that made it hard to let go. [[7569 旁白 neutral]]
After another round of sweet talk, Chi Xiaocheng shyly returned to normal, her cute expression making Su Tao even more excited. [[7570 旁白 happy]]
Great, the yandere state is controllable, as long as I don't provoke Xiaocheng too much at the beginning! [[7571 苏桃 happy]]
As she felt happy, being so close to that cute face made Su Tao's heart race for some reason. [[7572 旁白 neutral]]
Her breathing grew heavier without her realizing it. [[7573 旁白 neutral]]
She looked up at Chi Xiaocheng nervously. "Um..." [[7574 苏桃 neutral]]
"You can." [[7575 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled. "I've been so good, I want a little reward from Taotao too~" [[7576 池小橙 happy]]
So this counts as a reward? [[7577 苏桃 neutral]]
Inhale. [[7578 旁白 neutral]]
Exhale. [[7579 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao slowly reached out her hands as well. [[7580 旁白 neutral]]
She understood her own motive for being so proactive. [[7581 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't to express her love for Xiaocheng, but to restrain her. [[7582 旁白 neutral]]
This is necessary for treatment, this is necessary for treatment, this is necessary for treatment, this is necessary for treatment. [[7583 苏桃 neutral]]
Constantly giving herself this psychological suggestion, Su Tao hid the trace of affection in her heart. [[7584 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly closed her eyes. [[7585 旁白 neutral]]
