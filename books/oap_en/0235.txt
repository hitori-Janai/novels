Chapter 235: The Moonlight is Bright, but it Shines on the Roadside [[20173 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that the snack stall was about to close, and that Chi Xiaocheng might be getting ready for bed, Su Tao quickened her pace, running towards the entrance without making a sound so as not to disturb the other patients. [[20174 旁白 neutral]]
The elevator was slow, so she took the stairs instead. [[20175 旁白 neutral]]
Once outside the hospital, she broke into a sprint. [[20176 旁白 neutral]]
"W-wait a minute!" [[20177 苏桃 neutral]]
Panting as she yelled, she managed to stop the woman who had already packed up her stall and was about to leave. [[20178 旁白 neutral]]
"W-wait, I... I want to buy something!" [[20179 苏桃 neutral]]
The woman got off her cart again, waited for Su Tao, and smiled gently. "Don't rush, young lady. Catch your breath first. What would you like to buy? I don't have much left, though." [[20180 阿姨 happy]]
As she spoke, she was about to take out some things she had packed away, but Su Tao quickly shook her head. "No need for the trouble. A tanghulu is fine." [[20181 苏桃 neutral]]
"Alright." The woman patted the back of her tricycle. "Xiaoxia, bring that tanghulu down." [[20182 阿姨 neutral]]
A little girl popped her head out from the cart. "Big sister, are you buying the tanghulu for someone you like?" [[20183 小夏 neutral]]
She took down the tanghulu, and her innocent smile under the streetlight made Su Tao pause. [[20184 旁白 neutral]]
She forced a cute smile. "Yes, I had a fight with the person I like, so I'm buying this to make her happy." [[20185 苏桃 happy]]
"That's so nice!" The little girl looked at Su Tao with admiration. "My mom says I can't eat tanghulu because I'll lose my teeth." [[20186 小夏 happy]]
When she smiled, she opened her small mouth, revealing a gap where her front teeth used to be. [[20187 旁白 neutral]]
The woman added, "This girl is just greedy. You can have this tanghulu for free. I'd just eat it at home if it doesn't sell." [[20188 阿姨 happy]]
"I can't do that!" Su Tao quickly took out her phone to pay. [[20189 苏桃 neutral]]
But the woman stopped her. "You must care about that person a lot, running out of the hospital like that. It reminds me of my husband. When I was sick in the hospital, he bought me a tanghulu late at night to cheer me up." [[20190 阿姨 sad]]
"True love is priceless, and you shouldn't wait when you like someone. Just take it as a blessing from me." [[20191 阿姨 happy]]
The little girl nodded. "I'm so jealous of the person you like! When I grow up, I want to find a pretty girl like you to be my girlfriend!" [[20192 小夏 happy]]
Then, she added, "And she must be willing to buy me tanghulu, just like you!" [[20193 小夏 happy]]
Su Tao smiled, thinking it was just the innocent words of a child. [[20194 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't notice the woman's expression growing stiff. [[20195 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that Su Tao was in a hurry, the woman didn't keep her with more small talk. After giving her blessing, she left with the little girl. [[20196 旁白 neutral]]
As Su Tao turned, she overheard things like, "thinking about a partner at such a young age," "and a girl," and "did your brother teach you that? I'll break his legs when we get home," which made her blush. [[20197 旁白 neutral]]
Did I give that little girl the wrong idea? [[20198 苏桃 neutral]]
She tightened her grip on the tanghulu stick, remembering the little girl's innocent words. [[20199 苏桃 neutral]]
"Am I jealous of the person I like?" [[20200 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked up at the sky. The moon was bright and not hidden by the clouds. [[20201 旁白 neutral]]
The bright moonlight gently lit the way for pedestrians, and their faint shadows eased their loneliness. [[20202 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked down and saw her own shadow, but the ground was lit by the dim yellow of the streetlights. [[20203 旁白 neutral]]
She walked a few steps toward the hospital, and as she left the range of the streetlight, a car's headlights suddenly shone on her. [[20204 旁白 neutral]]
They were high beams, making the road bright but also making it hard for her to open her eyes and see the path ahead. [[20205 旁白 neutral]]
"If being liked by me is a good thing, would you still feel pain?" [[20206 苏桃 sad]]
Or rather, am I worthy of being liked by someone like you? [[20207 苏桃 sad]]
Without realizing it, Su Tao quickened her pace back to the hospital, took the elevator to the eighth floor, and hoped that Chi Xiaocheng hadn't gone to sleep yet. [[20208 苏桃 neutral]]
With every step, her heart was filled with mixed emotions. [[20209 旁白 neutral]]
Does she still hate me? What if she hates me even more after I apologize? [[20210 苏桃 sad]]
Should I find an excuse in case the apology fails, so I won't be so embarrassed? [[20211 苏桃 neutral]]
Standing in front of the hospital room, Su Tao took a deep breath, her hesitation turning into determination. [[20212 旁白 neutral]]
If I'm afraid of being embarrassed when I apologize, how can I prove that I like Xiaocheng! [[20213 苏桃 neutral]]
The curtains were drawn, and the door was closed, but she could see a faint light from under the door. [[20214 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao knocked on the door, first lightly, then a little harder. [[20215 旁白 neutral]]
She thought she would have to wait, but she immediately heard a calm voice from inside. "Come in." [[20216 池小橙 neutral]]
With a nervous heart, Su Tao pushed the door open, entered, and gently closed it behind her, not daring to look at Chi Xiaocheng. [[20217 旁白 neutral]]
"You took too long. I was about to fall asleep." [[20218 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing those soft but slightly dismissive words, Su Tao looked up in surprise. She saw Chi Xiaocheng looking at her. "X-Xiaocheng, you knew I was coming?" [[20219 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng pouted with a bit of disdain. "Your 'I want to see Xiaocheng' was probably heard by the whole hospital. What do you think?" [[20220 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao blushed and scratched her head in embarrassment. "I'm sorry..." [[20221 苏桃 sad]]
"Don't say you're sorry." Chi Xiaocheng interrupted her. "What do you want? Didn't I say I didn't want to see you?" [[20222 池小橙 angry]]
At these words, Su Tao bit her lower lip, and her heart sank. [[20223 旁白 sad]]
Was all that worrying for nothing? [[20224 苏桃 sad]]
Her heart was heavy and in turmoil, so she didn't notice that Chi Xiaocheng's tone had softened compared to before. [[20225 旁白 neutral]]
Now, she looked more like a shy person who didn't know what to say after being distant for a long time, pretending to be angry and telling the other person to comfort her. [[20226 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, Chi Xiaocheng's ultimate acting wouldn't be seen through. She wouldn't hate Su Tao forever. [[20227 旁白 neutral]]
She just needed to give her a sense of urgency. [[20228 旁白 neutral]]
With her memories now confused, Dongfang Yang had told her that Ye Liang was dead, and she had been counseled to believe she had "misunderstood" Taotao. So, of course, her affection level had to be raised. [[20229 旁白 neutral]]
The stick and carrot approach is a very useful tactic anywhere. [[20230 旁白 neutral]]
Unfortunately, Su Tao was too straightforward and emotionally slow. [[20231 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was already starting to act a little tsundere, but Su Tao was still looking down, hesitating about what to say. [[20232 旁白 neutral]]
Just make a move! If you make a move, I'll forgive you! [[20233 池小橙 neutral]]
Yes, Chi Xiaocheng was also a little anxious. [[20234 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to keep some distance to train Su Tao according to her plan. [[20235 旁白 neutral]]
But she also wanted to be close to her. [[20236 旁白 neutral]]
Speaking of which, it's been a long time since I've hugged Taotao. [[20237 旁白 happy]]
