Chapter 60 Having Both Sickness and Cuteness is True Yandere [[5282 旁白 neutral]]
Less than three days?! [[5283 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao even thought a week had passed. [[5284 旁白 neutral]]
Her hand, holding the phone, trembled continuously, as if her strength hadn't recovered. [[5285 旁白 neutral]]
Her slender index and middle fingers, in disbelief, covered her lips. [[5286 旁白 neutral]]
Three days, meaning excluding the first day when she almost gave up. [[5287 旁白 neutral]]
Only two days later, she actually thought a week had passed! [[5288 旁白 neutral]]
Every time Xiaocheng said it was a certain time, she always felt that time passed too quickly. [[5289 旁白 neutral]]
She felt it especially clearly when she took a bath. Xiaocheng would say half an hour, but she felt like only ten minutes had passed before Xiaocheng came in. [[5290 旁白 neutral]]
The oppressive environment made her feel terrified, and her confusion about the outside world made her uneasy, coupled with the dark cuisine. [[5291 旁白 neutral]]
And the only comfort was Chi Xiaocheng herself. [[5292 旁白 neutral]]
She had both a pathological, terrifying side; and then she would turn around and become so cute. [[5293 旁白 neutral]]
This made Su Tao feel even more that it wasn't how wonderful Xiaocheng was when she wasn't yandere. [[5294 旁白 neutral]]
But could such a yandere really be cured? [[5295 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao mechanically turned to look at Chi Xiaocheng. The small figure was tinkering with something by the sofa. [[5296 旁白 neutral]]
Only by liking her could she leave the room. [[5297 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, if she didn't go to that extent, how could she pretend to like her? [[5298 旁白 neutral]]
This was unavoidable. [[5299 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao composed herself and clicked into WeChat, finding many messages that had been replied to one by one. The reasons were bizarre, but she had already taken leave before she left, and no one suspected her disappearance for these three days. [[5300 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng handled it very carefully. [[5301 旁白 neutral]]
Besides restricting her, she didn't affect her life in any way. [[5302 旁白 neutral]]
Everything happened. [[5303 旁白 neutral]]
And yet, nothing seemed to have happened. [[5304 旁白 neutral]]
A secret is a secret because it is hidden deep in the heart, unseen by others, yet constantly oppressing the soul. Once revealed, it is like a flood bursting its banks. [[5305 旁白 neutral]]
"Tao Tao." [[5306 池小橙 neutral]]
Amidst her chaotic thoughts, Chi Xiaocheng's voice sounded. [[5307 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked over. The small loli had already turned around, holding a sachet embroidered with an orange pattern, "This is for you." [[5308 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao took the sachet and found it had a very pleasant and familiar scent. [[5309 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng explained, "This sachet helps soothe the mind, reduce fatigue, and aids sleep." [[5310 池小橙 neutral]]
The moment she saw the sachet, Su Tao couldn't help but think of the incense burner, and her hand holding the sachet trembled slightly. [[5311 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng understood Su Tao's thoughts and smiled faintly, "Don't worry, I didn't tamper with this. Tao Tao has been very tired these three days, and probably hasn't slept well, right?" [[5312 池小橙 neutral]]
"I'm sorry~" [[5313 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head, as obedient as a child who had done something wrong. [[5314 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao held the sachet. Whether it was psychological or not, she did feel some relief from her fatigue. [[5315 旁白 neutral]]
And she also liked the scent of the sachet. [[5316 旁白 neutral]]
It made her feel at ease. [[5317 旁白 neutral]]
"I believe you." [[5318 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao clutched the sachet and reached out to stroke Chi Xiaocheng's head, "I'm also at fault for what happened these past few days. I'm sorry, Xiaocheng." [[5319 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng lowered her head, seemingly trembling slightly from the comfort of being stroked. [[5320 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hesitated for a long time, then seriously said to Chi Xiaocheng, "So, for what happened these past few days, let's... let's pretend it never happened, okay?" [[5321 苏桃 neutral]]
"Mm~" [[5322 池小橙 neutral]]
A mosquito-like response sounded, and Su Tao showed a relaxed smile, "Then Xiaocheng, I'll go back now, okay?" [[5323 苏桃 neutral]]
"Sachet... remember to keep it with you." [[5324 池小橙 neutral]]
"Okay." [[5325 苏桃 neutral]]
The complex emotions at play made Su Tao involuntarily quicken her steps towards the door. Even as she squatted down to put on her shoes in the entryway, she felt too guilty to look back at Chi Xiaocheng. [[5326 旁白 neutral]]
She was afraid that if she looked back, she would be caught in this dark room again. [[5327 旁白 neutral]]
And precisely because she didn't look back, she didn't see Chi Xiaocheng's flushed, excited face and possessive eyes. [[5328 旁白 neutral]]
"System, I was the one who kept her at home and did such excessive things to her, yet she still voluntarily took all the responsibility and was so gentle with me." [[5329 池小橙 neutral]]
"This is the white moonlight~!" [[5330 池小橙 happy]]
"She's truly likable." [[5331 池小橙 happy]]
Looking at Su Tao's back as she put on her shoes, Chi Xiaocheng's eyes couldn't help but show reluctance. [[5332 旁白 neutral]]
An inexplicable urge arose in her heart. [[5333 旁白 neutral]]
To keep Su Tao in her home like this, and for it to last forever. [[5334 旁白 neutral]]
Shoes on, clothes draped, Su Tao opened the door. The coldness, different from the room's warmth, rushed in. [[5335 旁白 neutral]]
Along with the fresh air, this coldness made her feel refreshed. [[5336 旁白 neutral]]
"Finally, I can leave." [[5337 苏桃 neutral]]
At this moment, would Xiaocheng be reluctant? [[5338 旁白 neutral]]
An emotion rose in Su Tao's heart. As she turned to close the door after stepping out, she subconsciously glanced at Chi Xiaocheng. [[5339 旁白 neutral]]
What kind of eyes were those? [[5340 旁白 neutral]]
Within the crimson, reluctance, affection, longing, and loss were intertwined. [[5341 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao strangely felt Chi Xiaocheng's emotions. [[5342 旁白 neutral]]
Her affection for her was not just an act. [[5343 旁白 neutral]]
"Click—" [[5344 旁白 neutral]]
The door closed. [[5345 旁白 neutral]]
The pretty figure disappeared at the end of the hallway. Chi Xiaocheng let out a long sigh and sat on the sofa, "It's a pity three days is still too short. How great would it be if I had a week." [[5346 池小橙 sad]]
[Host, you collected a total of 2185 emotion points from the female lead Su Tao these three days. After deducting the 1000 emotion points required for the mental sachet, plus the remaining emotion points from before, you now have 1215 points. Do you want to draw cards?] [[5347 系统 neutral]]
"Not yet, save them for later." [[5348 池小橙 neutral]]
1200 points, it seems like a lot, but it can be used up quickly. [[5349 旁白 neutral]]
These days, she had already spent hundreds of emotion points just from the shop. [[5350 旁白 neutral]]
The incense burner that made Su Tao weak, the yandere light novel she secretly took, and all the various items used to decorate the room were all purchased from the system. [[5351 旁白 neutral]]
[But Host, this sachet doesn't seem very necessary, it's so expensive.] [[5352 系统 neutral]]
"Of course it's necessary. Before, every time I saw Su Tao, her face was more or less tired. She had to study, work part-time, and would be bothered by those male leads with various things. It's probably normal for her not to sleep well." [[5353 池小橙 neutral]]
"Her complexion has become even more haggard these past three days." [[5354 池小橙 neutral]]
"Even so, she still forced herself to talk to me with a smile." [[5355 池小橙 neutral]]
"My heart aches!" [[5356 池小橙 sad]]
"If this continues, even if I don't do anything to her, she'll collapse sooner or later. What's more, because I changed the plot, she doesn't seem to have met that divine doctor male lead yet. How long can she last without anyone helping her regulate her body?" [[5357 池小橙 neutral]]
Giving gifts was just a side note, caring was the real intention. [[5358 旁白 neutral]]
"Moreover, this can better establish my yandere persona." Chi Xiaocheng walked towards the balcony, seeing Su Tao's back as she walked towards the community gate from the high-rise building. [[5359 池小橙 neutral]]
It was as if she was talking to the system, and also to herself, "Yandere, yandere. Only sickness without cuteness cannot attract people." [[5360 池小橙 neutral]]
"Killing people, stabbing people, locking them in dark rooms, even eating people, using love and affection as excuses to vent dark psychology. This isn't yandere, it's insanity. The yandere formula isn't kill, kill, kill and eat, eat, eat." [[5361 池小橙 neutral]]
"Sickness makes people conflicted, cuteness makes people likeable. Having both sickness and cuteness is true yandere." [[5362 池小橙 neutral]]
"If I only put pressure on Su Tao and show my terrifying side, even if I can retain her with the affection she has for the original owner, what will be the final outcome?" [[5363 池小橙 neutral]]
"She will collapse, she will not be able to bear it, she will think I am crazy, and finally go crazy, or be broken by me. There are countless side branches, but the one I like will never be reached." [[5364 池小橙 neutral]]
"This is not what I want." [[5365 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao's back, her eyes growing colder, "So, another step to make her like me is to eliminate all the people around her who are in the way, one by one!" [[5366 池小橙 angry]]
From afar, a man was talking to Su Tao at the community security booth. [[5367 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang! [[5368 旁白 neutral]]
This guy actually came directly to her neighborhood! [[5369 旁白 neutral]]
