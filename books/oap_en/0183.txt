Chapter 183: Her White Moonlight [[15990 旁白 neutral]]
When it came to love, Su Tao had been telling herself, even hypnotizing herself, for a long time. [[15991 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm just pretending to like Xiaocheng." [[15992 苏桃 neutral]]
She did this to go along with and manage her yandere tendencies. [[15993 旁白 neutral]]
Before, she thought it would calm Xiaocheng down and help treat her illness. [[15994 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until now, after Chi Xiaocheng was gone, that she understood. The girl with long, tea-colored hair had always wanted to remove the "pretending" from her affection. [[15995 旁白 sad]]
If she had just given her that, perhaps her yandere nature could have been cured. [[15996 旁白 sad]]
Just as Wei Feng said, if her need for security had been fulfilled, only the normal and obedient parts of her would have remained. [[15997 旁白 neutral]]
Why didn't I think of that before? [[15998 苏桃 sad]]
Was it because there was too much pressure? [[15999 苏桃 sad]]
Or was it because the idea of a same-sex relationship was hard to accept? [[16000 苏桃 sad]]
"Huu~" [[16001 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed and shook her head, trying to clear her chaotic thoughts. [[16002 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know what real love was, but when she was with Xiaocheng and she wasn't being a yandere, she really liked and enjoyed that time. [[16003 旁白 neutral]]
For now, she decided to consider that feeling as love. [[16004 旁白 neutral]]
Even though this love came too late, it was better than doing nothing at all. [[16005 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps in a dream, or after she died, she could see Xiaocheng again and tell her that she had loved her too. [[16006 旁白 sad]]
She pushed down the painful, confusing, and heavy feelings, and instead recalled the beautiful and relaxing memories. [[16007 旁白 neutral]]
As her thoughts cleared, Su Tao felt a sense of relief. [[16008 旁白 neutral]]
Her body was still extremely tired, as if she could collapse at any moment. [[16009 旁白 neutral]]
But the cold wind on her face and her improved mental state made her expression less numb. [[16010 旁白 neutral]]
She looked up at Wei Feng again. The young man had, at some point, crouched down and was drawing circles in the snow with a beer bottle. [[16011 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't even noticed that his clothes and hair were covered in white frost. [[16012 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao touched her face, embarrassed. "Um, this is the first time we've met, so we can't be together, right? You're a good person, so I think even after this breakup, you'll definitely find someone better." [[16013 苏桃 neutral]]
Wei Feng stood up and looked at Su Tao with a wronged expression. "Even if you're rejecting me, please don't give me the 'good person' card, okay?" [[16014 韦峰 sad]]
"So... don't jump into the river, okay?" [[16015 苏桃 neutral]]
"You've completely ruined the mood for me to jump!" [[16016 韦峰 angry]]
"So you're not jumping?" [[16017 苏桃 neutral]]
"I'm not jumping!" [[16018 韦峰 angry]]
Wei Feng grabbed the beer bottle, wanting to throw it into the river to vent, but then he thought that littering wasn't right and held back. [[16019 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at Su Tao, wanting to say more, but bit his lip. "Do you think I can meet another girl like you?" [[16020 韦峰 sad]]
"Um... what part of me are you referring to?" [[16021 苏桃 neutral]]
"That feeling... like moonlight." [[16022 韦峰 neutral]]
Hearing this question, the image of Chi Xiaocheng flashed through Su Tao's mind, and she nodded gently. [[16023 旁白 neutral]]
Then she nodded more firmly. "Don't worry, you definitely will." [[16024 苏桃 happy]]
Someone might see her as their white moonlight. [[16025 旁白 neutral]]
But she had her own white moonlight too. [[16026 旁白 neutral]]
Every month, you might meet your own white moonlight. [[16027 旁白 neutral]]
Wei Feng let out a long breath, and a smile gradually appeared on his face in the darkness. [[16028 旁白 happy]]
It turned out there were many girls in the world who were more outstanding and beautiful than his ex-girlfriend. Maybe he really could find someone better. [[16029 旁白 happy]]
He put his hands on his hips and said cheerfully, "I'll do you a favor and not jump. But can you tell me your name?" [[16030 韦峰 happy]]
"Su Tao." [[16031 苏桃 neutral]]
The wind blew with a "whoosh," carrying her voice away as it tousled her hair. [[16032 旁白 neutral]]
"Also, please don't say you like me anymore. The person I like will get angry if they hear it." [[16033 苏桃 neutral]]
She waved her hand and, after confirming Wei Feng wouldn't jump, she turned and left. [[16034 旁白 neutral]]
Her slender figure, lit by the dim yellow streetlights, was gradually hidden by the wind and snow. Wei Feng stood where he was, digging his ear thoughtfully. [[16035 旁白 neutral]]
"Speaking of which, what was the name she just said? The wind was too strong, I didn't hear it clearly. Was it Su Tao? Su Tou? Xia Tao?" [[16036 韦峰 neutral]]
"Such a beautiful girl, and I didn't even catch her name... Wait, was she just calling me a loser!" [[16037 韦峰 angry]]
After parting with the suicidal boy she met on the road, Su Tao continued walking in the snow, but this time she was no longer lost. She walked firmly toward Chi Xiaocheng's home. [[16038 旁白 neutral]]
"I wonder if Ningning is still there. If she is, I should apologize to her." [[16039 苏桃 neutral]]
But Su Tao couldn't help but worry about her health, being out in the snow so late. [[16040 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't until she reached the entrance of the residential complex that she started to feel nervous again. [[16041 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind kept replaying what she should do if she had to face Fang Ning again. [[16042 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, Fang Ning was not waiting there. [[16043 旁白 neutral]]
She walked to the security booth, shook the water from her clothes, and took out her phone. [[16044 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello, is this Dongfang Yang?" [[16045 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's me. You sound like you're in better spirits." [[16046 东方阳 neutral]]
Hearing his concern, Su Tao was taken aback for a moment. "I've sorted out some things about Xiaocheng. I'm fine, but I might have to trouble you with something again." [[16047 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang said, "Just tell me. It's not like you guys haven't troubled me before. Just treat me to a meal when you've fully recovered." [[16048 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao agreed, "Okay, okay. It's about Fang Ning, do you remember her? The little girl who saw me off at my dorm." [[16049 苏桃 neutral]]
"I remember. What's wrong?" [[16050 东方阳 neutral]]
"She somehow found out that Xiaocheng died. She was saved by Xiaocheng in the past and has deep feelings for her. She came looking for me about half an hour ago." [[16051 苏桃 neutral]]
"We... we had a fight, and now she's left Xiaocheng's house. I don't know where she went. I might need your help to find her. I'm a little worried something might happen to her." [[16052 苏桃 sad]]
Even though Fang Ning was an adult, her small, malnourished frame made Su Tao subconsciously treat her like a child. [[16053 旁白 neutral]]
It was late at night, snowing heavily, and she had just learned about Chi Xiaocheng's death. [[16054 旁白 sad]]
Thinking about her own state in the days after Xiaocheng passed away, Su Tao couldn't help but feel anxious. [[16055 旁白 sad]]
Soon, Dongfang Yang's helpless yet trustworthy voice came through the phone. "She was near your place half an hour ago, right? Got it, I'll send people to look for her right away." [[16056 东方阳 neutral]]
"Okay, thank you for the trouble." [[16057 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao hung up the phone. She was about to go home, but the uneasiness and guilt in her heart wouldn't go away. [[16058 旁白 neutral]]
Without thinking, she turned and walked back into the heavy snow. [[16059 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, she had been searching in the snow for less than half an hour when Dongfang Yang called, saying he had seen Fang Ning at the hospital. [[16060 旁白 happy]]
The little one had gone to see Chi Xiaocheng's body again. [[16061 旁白 neutral]]
Completely relieved, Su Tao finally returned to the residential complex. [[16062 旁白 happy]]
As she took the elevator up to her apartment door, the pain and guilt that had briefly faded away returned. [[16063 旁白 sad]]
Before, she was just avoiding it, thinking that if she didn't think about it, everything would be fine. [[16064 旁白 neutral]]
But now that she had faced and remembered Chi Xiaocheng's cuteness, she could no longer escape the painful memories of her illness. [[16065 旁白 sad]]
Until the door opened. [[16066 旁白 neutral]]
Before Su Tao's pain could fully develop, she saw that the lights were on inside. A tabby cat was playing with a straw doll that she didn't recognize, swinging it back and forth. [[16067 旁白 neutral]]
The moment she looked at it, Su Tao had a feeling. [[16068 旁白 neutral]]
The straw doll seemed to be looking at her too. [[16069 旁白 neutral]]
