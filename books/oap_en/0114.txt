Chapter 114: Let Me Hold You One Last Time Before I Die [[9947 旁白 neutral]]
Several men were staring at them menacingly, and Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but feel nervous. [[9948 旁白 sad]]
Without her dark transformation, she couldn't even fight off a rooster. [[9949 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao, on the other hand, was racking her brain trying to figure out who sent these men. [[9950 旁白 neutral]]
They were well-built and disciplined, so it was definitely not a spur-of-the-moment kidnapping. [[9951 苏桃 neutral]]
She thought back to the scene from just now. [[9952 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao's heart clenched, and she gripped Chi Xiaocheng's hand tighter. [[9953 旁白 sad]]
Were they sent by Ye Liang? [[9954 苏桃 sad]]
Or Lin Fangya? [[9955 苏桃 sad]]
No matter who it was, their target was Xiaocheng! [[9956 苏桃 sad]]
"Run!" [[9957 苏桃 sad]]
She didn't know how many of them there were, but if they could just get back to the car, they could escape this attack! [[9958 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao grabbed Chi Xiaocheng's hand and immediately ran towards the stairs leading to the first floor. [[9959 旁白 sad]]
The men started moving at the same time. [[9960 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao didn't even need to shout for help; Chi Xiaocheng's earlier scream had already sent the shoppers into a panic. [[9961 旁白 sad]]
Word spread quickly, and the mall's security guards gathered. [[9962 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was running fast, but Chi Xiaocheng was struggling to keep up. [[9963 旁白 sad]]
She stumbled several times, on the verge of falling. [[9964 旁白 sad]]
Seeing this, Su Tao simply swept Chi Xiaocheng up in her arms. [[9965 旁白 neutral]]
A reassuring voice whispered in her ear, "Hold on tight, don't fall." [[9966 苏桃 neutral]]
The alert skill was still blaring, but Chi Xiaocheng's panicked heart gradually calmed down. [[9967 旁白 neutral]]
The vicious men began to close in, but there were many shoppers around, including some good Samaritans who helped the security guards subdue them. [[9968 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao rushed to the sports car without stopping. [[9969 旁白 sad]]
She tossed Chi Xiaocheng into the passenger seat and started the car immediately. [[9970 旁白 sad]]
"Xiaocheng, buckle up!" [[9971 苏桃 sad]]
Once in the car, however, Chi Xiaocheng's alert skill grew even louder. A certain direction gave her a feeling of no return, so she quickly said, "Taotao, don't... don't go towards home. That way... I felt like something was wrong the whole way here!" [[9972 池小橙 sad]]
Yes, she understood now. The alert skill wasn't triggered because of her dark transformation. [[9973 池小橙 neutral]]
It was because someone had been watching her all along! [[9974 池小橙 sad]]
"Then we'll go in the opposite direction. And call Dongfang Yang and Si Chen!" [[9975 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao had already started the car. Though she looked pale, she was still incredibly calm. [[9976 旁白 neutral]]
While Chi Xiaocheng was making the call, Su Tao saw three cars behind them, driving recklessly to chase them. [[9977 旁白 sad]]
This was a busy downtown area! [[9978 旁白 sad]]
The slightest carelessness could cost someone their life! [[9979 旁白 sad]]
Just then, a little girl stood at the edge of the road around the corner, about to pick up a teddy bear she had dropped. [[9980 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao slammed on the brakes and jerked the steering wheel. [[9981 旁白 sad]]
With a jolt, they narrowly avoided the little girl. [[9982 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng steadied herself and said quickly, "I can't reach Si Chen. Dongfang Yang said he's sending people over, and the police told us to head to the Binjiang Bridge. There are fewer people there, and a precinct is quickly deploying officers." [[9983 池小橙 sad]]
"Okay!" [[9984 苏桃 sad]]
With another turn of the wheel and a drift, Su Tao quickly changed routes. [[9985 旁白 neutral]]
The three pursuing cars clearly didn't expect a new driver like Su Tao to handle the car so well in a crisis. [[9986 旁白 neutral]]
Instead of driving straight, she was even drifting! [[9987 旁白 neutral]]
Visibility was low at night, and the road was covered in snow, making it very easy to skid! [[9988 旁白 neutral]]
In one of the black cars, a middle-aged man in a suit grinned menacingly, "Even old pros wouldn't dare to drive like this. Kid, I advise you not to be so cocky!" [[9989 陌生男1 angry]]
He stomped on the gas and yelled, "Hold on tight, everyone!" [[9990 陌生男1 happy]]
Then, he executed a perfect drift that was even more impressive than Su Tao's. [[9991 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, the expressions of the other men in the car went from admiration to composure, then to panic, followed by curses. [[9992 旁白 neutral]]
With a "boom," the car skidded and crashed into a streetlight. The front of the car burst into flames, followed by an explosion. [[9993 旁白 sad]]
The fire lit up the sky! [[9994 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng watched the exploding car in the rearview mirror and swallowed nervously. [[9995 旁白 sad]]
She had barely earned any Emotion Points in the last half month, and she had spent some for self-protection before. [[9996 旁白 sad]]
Now, she only had 300 Emotion Points! [[9997 旁白 sad]]
In a situation like this, she was completely useless. [[9998 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao seemed to notice Chi Xiaocheng's anxiety. She reached out a hand to pat her head and comforted her, "Don't worry, I'm here." [[9999 苏桃 neutral]]
Her slender figure suddenly seemed to grow taller. [[10000 旁白 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's gaze fixed on her determined and beautiful profile, and her heart pounded wildly. [[10001 旁白 happy]]
Just then, as their car crossed an intersection, an Audi shot out from their left rear, as if trying to ram them from the side. [[10002 旁白 sad]]
But they didn't expect Su Tao to be driving so fast. The sudden move caused it to crash into one of the cars behind them instead. [[10003 旁白 neutral]]
Another dazzling explosion followed. [[10004 旁白 sad]]
Like a firework, the reflection of the flames danced on Su Tao's beautiful face. [[10005 旁白 neutral]]
Her long, dark-gray hair was blown about by the wind from the slightly open window, but her face showed no panic. [[10006 旁白 neutral]]
No, perhaps there was panic. [[10007 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked down and saw that Su Tao's hands on the steering wheel and her feet on the pedals were trembling. [[10008 旁白 sad]]
The harsh environment, the dark night, and the people trying to kidnap her were like giant hands reaching out from the darkness, ready to grab her at any moment. [[10009 旁白 sad]]
But to keep Chi Xiaocheng calm and give her courage, Su Tao was trying hard to suppress her own anxiety. [[10010 旁白 neutral]]
After a turn, they finally left the normal road and got onto the elevated highway. Beyond this highway was the Binjiang Bridge. [[10011 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Su Tao breathed a sigh of relief. She gripped the steering wheel tightly, trying to keep her body from trembling too much. [[10012 旁白 sad]]
She looked at Chi Xiaocheng and smiled, "See? I told you everything would be fine. They can't keep up with us, and there isn't much traffic on the highway." [[10013 苏桃 happy]]
"Yeah, Taotao, you're amazing." [[10014 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded vigorously. [[10015 旁白 happy]]
"Xiaocheng, look over there, across the river." [[10016 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao tried to change the subject, not wanting her to dwell on the dangers of the night. [[10017 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng followed Su Tao's gaze out the left window. [[10018 旁白 neutral]]
Across the river, skyscrapers stood tall with twinkling lights. A reddish glow reflected on the not-yet-completely-frozen river, ripples swaying as light snow seemed to fall. [[10019 旁白 happy]]
The scene was as beautiful as a painting or a dream. [[10020 旁白 happy]]
But more beautiful than the scene was the person in the driver's seat. [[10021 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao looked out the window, her gaze cool and determined. Her long, dark-gray hair was tied into a low ponytail, with a few strands sticking to her slightly sweaty forehead. [[10022 旁白 happy]]
Her fair and beautiful profile made Chi Xiaocheng's quiet heart beat faster again. [[10023 旁白 happy]]
It wasn't fear or nervousness. [[10024 旁白 happy]]
This feeling was more like... falling in love. [[10025 旁白 happy]]
Being comforted by her, protected by her, treated gently by her, Chi Xiaocheng had never felt such a strong affection for Su Tao. [[10026 旁白 happy]]
In the past, she had always half-hypnotized herself into pursuing and holding onto a perfect girl like Su Tao, to avoid ending up like she did in her past life. [[10027 旁白 neutral]]
But now, Chi Xiaocheng clearly felt that she was attracted to this gentle and strong Su Tao. [[10028 旁白 happy]]
The moonlight shone through the window onto Chi Xiaocheng's face. [[10029 旁白 happy]]
At the same time, Su Tao turned to her with a smile and asked, "What do you think? It's beautiful, isn't it?" [[10030 苏桃 happy]]
A sweet feeling welled up in Chi Xiaocheng's heart, and she smiled brightly, "It's beautiful." [[10031 池小橙 happy]]
You're talking about the scenery. [[10032 池小橙 happy]]
I'm talking about you. [[10033 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng placed a hand over her heart, feeling it beat violently. She couldn't help but recall something someone once said. [[10034 旁白 happy]]
The tips of her ears turned slightly red. Mustering up her courage, she looked up at Su Tao and said, "Taotao, can you be my..." [[10035 池小橙 happy]]
Before she could finish her sentence. [[10036 旁白 sad]]
Another sound shattered the night's silence. [[10037 旁白 sad]]
"Bang!" [[10038 旁白 sad]]
A bullet grazed the car's window, creating a web of cracks and a deafening noise. [[10039 旁白 sad]]
"A gun?!" [[10040 池小橙 sad]]
The would-be confession was cut short, and both Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao's eyes widened in shock. [[10041 旁白 sad]]
They quickly looked in the rearview mirror and saw that two more black cars had appeared behind them, catching up after being left behind. [[10042 旁白 sad]]
In the dim streetlight, they could see two men leaning out of their car windows, holding something with dark, smoking barrels. [[10043 旁白 sad]]
"Damn it!" Su Tao cursed under her breath, her hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly her knuckles turned white. [[10044 苏桃 angry]]
Su Tao stomped on the gas and shouted, "Xiaocheng, hold on!" [[10045 苏桃 sad]]
With a roar, the sports car's engine echoed on the highway as it sped downhill, about to enter the bridge. [[10046 旁白 sad]]
But to Su Tao's surprise, the police had told them to come here. It had been a while, so the defenses should have been set up. Why was there no one to meet them? [[10047 苏桃 sad]]
Just then, Chi Xiaocheng's phone rang again. [[10048 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly answered it. It was Dongfang Yang's relieved voice, "Finally, I got through. Where are you now? Whatever you do, don't go onto the Binjiang Bridge!" [[10049 东方阳 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng shouted anxiously, "What do you mean? Didn't the police say they had set up a perimeter here?" [[10050 池小橙 sad]]
Dongfang Yang calmly and quickly explained the situation, "For the last half hour, both your and Su Tao's phones have been busy. I couldn't get through. The police call with you got cut off midway." [[10051 东方阳 sad]]
"You were supposed to be able to cross the Binjiang Bridge, but for some reason, the bridge started to collapse five minutes ago. Now there's a gap in the middle, and cars can't get across!" [[10052 东方阳 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng's pupils contracted, and a chill ran down her spine. [[10053 旁白 sad]]
"Taotao, can we change course?" [[10054 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao's face was pale, but she gritted her teeth and said, "I don't think so. There's only one straight path now. We should pray our tires don't get shot out." [[10055 苏桃 sad]]
The good news was that Dongfang Yang was probably paranoid, because the car's windows were bulletproof. [[10056 旁白 neutral]]
But if this continued, they would probably fall off the bridge. [[10057 旁白 sad]]
If the river was frozen, a fall from dozens of meters would be fatal. [[10058 旁白 sad]]
If the river wasn't frozen, how could they swim to shore in the sub-zero winter temperatures? [[10059 旁白 sad]]
The sound of gunfire echoed again, followed by the continuous pinging of bullets hitting the trunk. [[10060 旁白 sad]]
Dongfang Yang yelled into the phone, "Just try, try to hold on as long as you can! My helicopter is on the way!" [[10061 东方阳 sad]]
It was a matter of life and death! [[10062 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew that the world of a female-oriented novel was a dangerous place. [[10063 旁白 neutral]]
She had always lived cautiously, never causing trouble even with her hacking skills. [[10064 旁白 neutral]]
But now, she finally understood. [[10065 旁白 sad]]
"The will of the world is trying to erase me, isn't it?" [[10066 池小橙 sad]]
In her heart, Chi Xiaocheng asked the System this question. [[10067 旁白 sad]]
The voice in her head was also somber. [[10068 旁白 sad]]
[Yes, Host. This incident was likely initiated by Ye Liang or Lin Fangya to harm you and Su Tao. It should have been a simple kidnapping or threat, but the will of the world pushed the plot forward.] [[10069 系统 sad]]
And so, it turned into a Hollywood-style car chase. [[10070 旁白 neutral]]
Cars suddenly appearing from the darkness to block them, illegal firearms that shouldn't have appeared in the plot yet, and even a decades-old bridge collapsing. [[10071 旁白 neutral]]
This was an attempt to drive her to a dead end! [[10072 旁白 sad]]
At this moment, the roads on both sides of the Binjiang Bridge were blocked by accidents, leaving only a single straight path. [[10073 旁白 sad]]
With pursuers and guns behind them, the sports car had no choice but to drive onto the Binjiang Bridge. [[10074 旁白 sad]]
The Jiuzhou Binjiang Bridge was nearly 3 kilometers long. For a speeding sports car, three kilometers was just a short distance. [[10075 旁白 neutral]]
"System, give me three single draws." [[10076 池小橙 sad]]
She could only pin her hopes on these last three single draws. [[10077 旁白 sad]]
[Drawing...] [[10078 系统 neutral]]
[Host has obtained Nutrient Chocolate*2] [[10079 系统 neutral]]
[Host has obtained a Death-Substitution Scarecrow*1 (When the host suffers a fatal injury, the scarecrow will die in your place, leaving you with a sliver of life and putting you in a state of suspended animation for a random duration.)] [[10080 系统 neutral]]
The reward was drawn, but there was no trace of joy on Chi Xiaocheng's face. [[10081 旁白 sad]]
The pursuers behind them seemed to know that they had nowhere to run, and the gunfire gradually ceased. [[10082 旁白 neutral]]
Now, all Chi Xiaocheng could hear was the sound of the car. [[10083 旁白 neutral]]
She leaned back in the passenger seat, looked at Su Tao, and asked in her mind, "System, can this Death-Substitution Scarecrow be bound to Su Tao?" [[10084 池小橙 sad]]
She had a chance to survive, but what about Su Tao? [[10085 旁白 sad]]
If she could have drawn two of these, she could have given one to Su Tao, and maybe then Chi Xiaocheng would be happy. [[10086 旁白 sad]]
However, the System's answer was just as she expected. [[10087 旁白 neutral]]
[I'm sorry, Host. However, Su Tao is the female lead of this world. Her protagonist halo is very strong. The will of the world is using this incident to target you. Su Tao should survive due to some accident.] [[10088 系统 neutral]]
"But she'll get hurt." [[10089 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng murmured to herself, her clear eyes suddenly clouded with confusion. [[10090 旁白 sad]]
Just then, the car window suddenly opened. [[10091 旁白 neutral]]
It was Su Tao who had opened it. [[10092 旁白 neutral]]
The fierce wind from the high-speed car messed up Su Tao's hair. Her lips were pale, but she still forced a strained smile, "Xiaocheng, sorry, it's a bit cold with the window open, but I'm a little nervous. The wind helps calm me down." [[10093 苏桃 sad]]
The sound of the wind was louder than her voice. [[10094 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng could only barely hear what she was saying. [[10095 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao looked straight ahead, exhaled, and said apologetically, "I'm really sorry. I was planning to give you a surprise tonight, but I never expected something like this to happen on my first time driving. I've had some conflicts with Lin Fangya recently. This is probably her doing." [[10096 苏桃 sad]]
"She wants to get rid of me for Ye Liang." [[10097 苏桃 sad]]
"You got dragged into this, and you might even be in mortal danger. I..." [[10098 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao let go of the steering wheel with one hand and slapped her cheeks, "I can't say such depressing things. There's still a way out!" [[10099 苏桃 sad]]
Her tenacious spirit shone through at this moment. [[10100 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao leaned closer to Chi Xiaocheng, her voice rising above the howling wind, "Xiaocheng, listen carefully. According to the map, the broken part ahead is the only arched section of the Binjiang Bridge!" [[10101 苏桃 sad]]
"I'm going to floor it and try to fly to the other side of the bridge!" [[10102 苏桃 sad]]
"If... if I fail and we don't make it, you..." [[10103 苏桃 sad]]
She looked at the somewhat desperate Chi Xiaocheng, and the words on the tip of her tongue stopped. [[10104 旁白 neutral]]
Her hands stopped shaking, and her body no longer seemed to react with fear. For some reason, as soon as she thought about protecting the person in front of her, Su Tao felt an infinite source of strength. [[10105 旁白 happy]]
Her smile gradually softened, "If I fail and the car can't make the jump, we'll fall into the river together. When that happens, come into my arms." [[10106 苏桃 happy]]
"At the very end, let me hold you." [[10107 苏桃 happy]]
And I will hold you tight. [[10108 苏桃 happy]]
That way, at the moment we fall, I'll be underneath to protect you, and you'll definitely be okay. [[10109 苏桃 happy]]
Snowflakes began to fall from the sky as Su Tao stepped on the gas. [[10110 旁白 sad]]
The roar of the sports car grew louder. [[10111 旁白 sad]]
