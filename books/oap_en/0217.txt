Chapter 217: When Did I Ever Like You? [[18865 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao wasn't very sensitive; she was even a bit slow and straightforward. But the small change in how she was addressed still made her feel that something was a little off. [[18866 旁白 neutral]]
But the girl in front of her was awake and smiling at her just like before. Joy filled her heart, and Su Tao pushed the brief feeling of strangeness to the back of her mind. [[18867 旁白 neutral]]
She walked over to Chi Xiaocheng and took her right hand, her own hand trembling slightly. [[18868 旁白 neutral]]
She placed Chi Xiaocheng's fingertips in her palm and covered them with her other hand. [[18869 旁白 neutral]]
She held her hands gently, as if afraid she would run away again. [[18870 旁白 neutral]]
As the girl looked at her face, the many things she had wanted to say got stuck in her throat. [[18871 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, she didn't dare to meet Chi Xiaocheng's eyes, which were a little red but perfectly clear. [[18872 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, her gaze fell on the small hand, and she rubbed it gently. "Xiaocheng... how are you feeling?" [[18873 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng replied in a relaxed tone, "I think I'm fine. I can use a little bit of strength, but not much. My head also hurts a bit, and my chest feels tight and uncomfortable." [[18874 池小橙 neutral]]
"The doctor said I need to rest for at least two or three more days for a basic recovery. They also told me not to eat and to get nutrients through an IV for another day." [[18875 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao pressed, "Besides that, you don't feel any other problems?" [[18876 苏桃 neutral]]
"Um... I really don't feel like there's anything wrong." [[18877 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing her confident tone, Su Tao slowly breathed a sigh of relief. [[18878 旁白 neutral]]
What she was most worried about was the wound near Chi Xiaocheng's heart. [[18879 旁白 neutral]]
The bullet was lodged inside, creating a bloody hole. According to Professor Su, the impact of the bullet was only one millimeter away from her heart. [[18880 旁白 neutral]]
She pressed her lips together and subconsciously glanced at Chi Xiaocheng's chest. [[18881 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to ask about it but didn't know how to start. [[18882 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng noticed Su Tao's gaze and shrank back a little. "Is something wrong?" [[18883 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao quickly shook her head and smiled. "No, it's nothing. I'm just relieved to see you're okay." [[18884 苏桃 happy]]
After she spoke, the room fell into a brief silence again. [[18885 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng turned her head to look at the scenery outside the window, not at Su Tao. [[18886 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Su Tao lowered her head slightly, biting her lip in indecision. [[18887 旁白 neutral]]
Before coming here, she had thought of many things to say and imagined countless reunion scenarios. [[18888 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng would be reborn, crying out "Taotao," confessing her love while asking for hugs and even kisses. [[18889 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe after waking up, Xiaocheng would remember the pain of being shot and blame her for not saving her, her eyes filled with resentment and hatred. [[18890 旁白 neutral]]
She might even turn into a yandere right after waking up, confessing her love with a slightly hoarse voice that was both frightening and possessive, wanting to control her and keep her by her side. [[18891 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao was even prepared to be locked up in a small dark room again! [[18892 旁白 neutral]]
But now that she actually saw Chi Xiaocheng awake, Su Tao felt a growing sense of disharmony. [[18893 旁白 neutral]]
She was too calm. [[18894 旁白 neutral]]
Or maybe... obedient? [[18895 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she had just had a normal illness, taken a long nap, and felt no particular emotion upon seeing her. [[18896 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao even felt a faint sense of distance. [[18897 旁白 neutral]]
The small hand she was holding seemed to want to pull away. [[18898 旁白 neutral]]
So what should she say now? [[18899 旁白 neutral]]
Should she confess directly? [[18900 旁白 neutral]]
Tell Xiaocheng, I like you, I love you, I want to be your other half. [[18901 旁白 neutral]]
She had always hoped for this to happen. Maybe it would be more memorable in a more romantic and warm setting? [[18902 旁白 neutral]]
Like on a Ferris wheel? [[18903 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's mind was a bit of a mess; she couldn't quite figure out what Chi Xiaocheng was thinking right now. [[18904 旁白 neutral]]
While she was still thinking, she heard Chi Xiaocheng's voice. "Is there anything else? I'd like to rest." [[18905 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly looked up and said quickly, "I... I have one more thing to say!" [[18906 苏桃 neutral]]
The hands holding Chi Xiaocheng's were trembling slightly. [[18907 旁白 neutral]]
Maybe Xiaocheng was just really tired and needed to rest after waking up, which made her less emotional. [[18908 旁白 neutral]]
But. [[18909 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what, a confession was unavoidable, right? [[18910 旁白 neutral]]
It was something she had decided on long ago. [[18911 旁白 neutral]]
Something she no longer wanted to run away from. [[18912 旁白 neutral]]
To fulfill the wish that Xiaocheng had before she died, and surely still had now that she was alive again. [[18913 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took a deep breath and then looked at Chi Xiaocheng with a serious and affectionate expression. "Xiaocheng, I like you!" [[18914 苏桃 happy]]
The confession was out. [[18915 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng's reaction was not what she had expected. [[18916 旁白 neutral]]
Surprise, relief, happiness, satisfaction. [[18917 旁白 neutral]]
None of these emotions appeared. Instead, the girl in front of her looked like her brain had short-circuited from a long delay in processing. [[18918 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if she hadn't expected such a direct confession. [[18919 旁白 neutral]]
A slightly confused question came out. "Wait... what did you say?" [[18920 池小橙 neutral]]
Seeing her slightly dazed expression, Su Tao couldn't help but find it a little amusing. [[18921 旁白 neutral]]
She still remembered when Xiaocheng first confessed to her. [[18922 旁白 neutral]]
She had the same expression herself. [[18923 旁白 neutral]]
Sunlight streamed in from the window, making Su Tao's smile radiant. She said even more seriously, "Xiaocheng, I like you, I love you. Be my other half, and let's be together forever, okay?" [[18924 苏桃 happy]]
No hesitation, no repeating past mistakes. [[18925 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Xiaocheng became a yandere and uncontrollable in the future, their new life together had to begin! [[18926 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao held her breath, waiting for Chi Xiaocheng's nod and response. [[18927 旁白 neutral]]
She hoped for a scene where they would both cry and then embrace. [[18928 旁白 neutral]]
She was even a little nervous, wondering what would happen if a nurse or another patient walked by while she and Xiaocheng were kissing, since the door wasn't closed. [[18929 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, she shouldn't refuse, right? [[18930 旁白 neutral]]
But the greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment. [[18931 旁白 neutral]]
The sunlight that had been shining on her face gradually moved to a potted plant nearby as clouds and wind passed by. [[18932 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng did not look surprised or happy. [[18933 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she seemed a little scared and used her strength to move away to the other side of the bed. [[18934 旁白 neutral]]
The small hand that Su Tao had been holding. [[18935 旁白 neutral]]
Was forcefully pulled away. [[18936 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Su Tao, what are you talking about? I only think of you as a sister. Please don't say things that could be misunderstood, okay?" [[18937 池小橙 angry]]
The light words seemed to echo in the hospital room, ringing in Su Tao's ears. [[18938 旁白 neutral]]
This time, it was Su Tao's turn to stand there stunned, her pupils trembling in shock. "Xiao... Xiaocheng, what... what did you say?" [[18939 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng said coldly, "I said, please stop being unreasonable, Sister Su Tao. I can treat this as a joke this time, but please don't let there be a next time." [[18940 池小橙 angry]]
"Also, I need to rest. Please leave." [[18941 池小橙 angry]]
Her words were cold and rejecting, and Chi Xiaocheng turned her face away with a look of annoyance. [[18942 旁白 neutral]]
This reaction, so different from her fantasy, combined with Chi Xiaocheng's few light words, left Su Tao in a daze. [[18943 旁白 neutral]]
Was this a dream? [[18944 旁白 neutral]]
Or was Xiaocheng just joking? [[18945 旁白 neutral]]
And what's with "Sister Su Tao"? I'm your Taotao, haven't you always called me Taotao! [[18946 旁白 neutral]]
The immense shock left Su Tao's mind reeling. She watched as Chi Xiaocheng slowly turned to the other side, and she stood up in a panic. [[18947 旁白 neutral]]
She reached out and firmly gripped Chi Xiaocheng's shoulders. [[18948 旁白 neutral]]
Forcing Chi Xiaocheng to turn back to face her, she looked into her eyes, panicking as a terrible premonition welled up inside her. [[18949 旁白 neutral]]
She desperately wanted to deny the answer in her heart. [[18950 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao instinctively tightened her grip, shaking Chi Xiaocheng's body. "Xiaocheng, what are you talking about? Haven't you always liked me?" [[18951 苏桃 sad]]
But her advance was met with rejection. [[18952 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling the pain in her shoulders from the tight grip, Chi Xiaocheng used all her strength to push the panicked Su Tao away. [[18953 池小橙 angry]]
With a "thud," the girl fell to the floor, knocking over a chair. [[18954 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, her gaze never left Chi Xiaocheng. [[18955 旁白 neutral]]
The girl pushed aside her tea-colored hair that fell to her shoulders and gently rubbed her sore shoulder, her tone now clearly impatient. "What are you going crazy for? When did I ever like you!" [[18956 池小橙 angry]]
At that moment, the sun shining in from the window gradually dimmed. [[18957 旁白 neutral]]
