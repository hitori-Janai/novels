Chapter 200: Are You Looking for Me? [[17516 旁白 neutral]]
We can't escape. [[17517 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng hid in a bush near the pavilion. The scarecrow's legs rested on a branch, with only its head peeking out from the leaves, watching Chu Lingfeng approach from a distance. [[17518 旁白 neutral]]
She could tell he was deliberately toying with her and might have even called others to surround the area. [[17519 池小橙 neutral]]
It was a little dangerous. [[17520 池小橙 neutral]]
But this was also a chance to take care of Chu Lingfeng right here! [[17521 池小橙 neutral]]
I'll take the risk! [[17522 池小橙 neutral]]
Otherwise, with over ten days until her resurrection, she couldn't follow Su Tao all the time. What if Chu Lingfeng caused trouble under the influence of the world's will? [[17523 池小橙 sad]]
He was already trying to get close to Taotao! [[17524 池小橙 angry]]
Watching him approach the pavilion, Chi Xiaocheng hid and said in her mind, "System, you have to help me activate the 'darkening' skill. Don't be useless like with Ye Liang." [[17525 池小橙 neutral]]
[Umm...] [[17526 系统 neutral]]
The System hesitated. [[17527 旁白 neutral]]
[Don't worry, Host. I'll do my best this time!] [[17528 系统 happy]]
With the System's support, Chi Xiaocheng was full of confidence. [[17529 旁白 neutral]]
But before showing herself, she thought she could harvest some of this male lead's Emotion Points. [[17530 池小橙 neutral]]
As she prepared, Chu Lingfeng stepped into the pavilion, his fists clenched in a fighting stance. [[17531 旁白 neutral]]
"Come out, you pretender!" [[17532 楚凌风 angry]]
He shouted calmly. After mentally preparing himself on the way, he was relatively composed. [[17533 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at her low Emotion Points and stepped onto the bush. The cute yet strange scarecrow opened its dry lips, "Are... you looking for me?" [[17534 池小橙 neutral]]
She deliberately used a voice-changing skill to imitate the voice of Fiddlesticks from League of Legends. [[17535 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng looked toward the sound and saw the red eyes, his heart tightening. [[17536 旁白 neutral]]
The fear from the cat-like eyes was starting to affect him. [[17537 旁白 neutral]]
But Chu Lingfeng remained calm. "What, you only dare to talk through a puppet? We don't have any grudge against each other, do we?" [[17538 楚凌风 neutral]]
"Does a ghost need a reason to find someone?" [[17539 池小橙 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng scoffed, "A ghost? If you're a ghost, then come out!" [[17540 楚凌风 angry]]
He didn't believe that ghosts really existed in this world! [[17541 旁白 neutral]]
Despite saying that, his body instinctively went on the defensive. [[17542 旁白 neutral]]
However, the scary scene he imagined didn't happen. The scarecrow on the bush suddenly stopped moving, but its glowing red eyes kept staring at him. [[17543 旁白 neutral]]
The villa was brightly lit, and even this area had a faint light. [[17544 旁白 neutral]]
But the birthday party was about to start, and everyone was in the front hall. This place was empty. The cold winter wind blew, making the bushes rustle. [[17545 旁白 neutral]]
Besides that, there was the chirping of insects. [[17546 旁白 neutral]]
In horror movies, the environment is just as important as the music for creating fear. [[17547 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the System's notification sounded in Chi Xiaocheng's mind. [[17548 旁白 neutral]]
[Male lead Chu Lingfeng is feeling nervous because of the Host.] [[17549 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +34...] [[17550 系统 happy]]
A new character is a new character. After Su Tao's breakdowns, he only provided single-digit Emotion Points, no matter how much she pressured him. [[17551 池小橙 happy]]
This was just a normal emotion, and it gave her 34 points. [[17552 池小橙 happy]]
It made Chi Xiaocheng feel great for some reason. [[17553 旁白 happy]]
Besides the wind, nothing happened for a while, and the tense Chu Lingfeng subconsciously relaxed for a moment. [[17554 旁白 neutral]]
Could it be just a bluff? [[17555 楚凌风 neutral]]
Just as he thought that, his pupils suddenly shrank. [[17556 旁白 neutral]]
The motionless scarecrow on the bush suddenly grew larger, turning into a terrifying giant mouth that lunged at him! [[17557 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng's legs trembled, and he subconsciously dove to the side. [[17558 旁白 neutral]]
But the giant mouth disappeared the moment he moved. [[17559 旁白 neutral]]
The illusion skill used a lot of Emotion Points, so a brief scare was enough. [[17560 旁白 neutral]]
[Male lead Chu Lingfeng is feeling panicked because of the Host.] [[17561 系统 neutral]]
[Emotion Points +21...] [[17562 系统 happy]]
[Emotion Points +17...] [[17563 系统 happy]]
[Emotion Points +33...] [[17564 系统 happy]]
Unlike the one-time gain before, Chu Lingfeng was now in a state of continuous panic. [[17565 旁白 neutral]]
The constant notifications made Chi Xiaocheng feel incredibly satisfied. [[17566 旁白 happy]]
But the scare wasn't over. [[17567 旁白 neutral]]
Besides the giant mouth, various horror movie monsters appeared before him. Each time Chu Lingfeng felt fear, the monster would quickly disappear. [[17568 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Chu Lingfeng was slow, he understood the situation after being scared more than ten times. [[17569 旁白 neutral]]
These are all illusions. The things that suddenly appear are fake! [[17570 楚凌风 neutral]]
By the time he realized it, Chi Xiaocheng had already earned 300 Emotion Points. [[17571 旁白 happy]]
She sat on the bush, staring at Chu Lingfeng with a smirk. [[17572 池小橙 happy]]
Her demonic eyes looked so happy. [[17573 旁白 happy]]
However, the tricked male lead was not happy. With a dark expression, he rushed directly toward Chi Xiaocheng, reaching out to grab the doll! [[17574 旁白 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng was prepared. She leaped behind the bush and disappeared from Chu Lingfeng's sight. [[17575 旁白 neutral]]
The once-cool male lead was now covered in sweat, his face pale. [[17576 旁白 neutral]]
He stomped hard into the bush and shouted, "Come out!" [[17577 楚凌风 angry]]
Every time he shouted, he would hear a reply, "Are you looking for me?" [[17578 池小橙 neutral]]
Along with this reply, another illusion appeared. [[17579 旁白 neutral]]
This time, a man appeared out of nowhere in front of him, swinging a kitchen knife at him. [[17580 旁白 neutral]]
Even though he knew it was fake, Chu Lingfeng still felt a pang of fear. [[17581 旁白 sad]]
He breathed a sigh of relief only after the knife passed through his arm without causing any injury. [[17582 旁白 neutral]]
The repeated tricks made Chu Lingfeng mentally exhausted. [[17583 旁白 neutral]]
He became more and more numb to the illusions. [[17584 旁白 neutral]]
The Emotion Points spent on the skills could no longer be earned back from Chu Lingfeng. [[17585 旁白 neutral]]
500 points was a huge gain. [[17586 池小橙 happy]]
And the illusions Chi Xiaocheng created later were of real people trying to slash him with knives. [[17587 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, he couldn't even be bothered to dodge. [[17588 旁白 neutral]]
It was like the story of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." [[17589 旁白 neutral]]
Facing this male lead, Chi Xiaocheng became extremely serious. [[17590 旁白 neutral]]
As Chu Lingfeng leaned weakly against the pavilion, another voice reached his ears. [[17591 旁白 neutral]]
"Why did you stop looking for me?" [[17592 池小橙 neutral]]
It was no longer the hoarse, terrifying voice of Fiddlesticks, but a soft and almost cute voice. [[17593 旁白 neutral]]
Behind him, a little girl with a hood and twin ponytails had appeared at some point. [[17594 旁白 neutral]]
The little girl held a fruit knife, and her red eyes were identical to the scarecrow's. [[17595 旁白 neutral]]
She smiled a demonic yet cute smile, "If you don't come looking for me, I'll come looking for you~" [[17596 池小橙 happy]]
Darkening! [[17597 旁白 neutral]]
The precise scalpel skill activated! [[17598 旁白 neutral]]
The fruit knife instantly stabbed out, aiming straight for Chu Lingfeng's neck! [[17599 旁白 neutral]]
PS: Recommending a friend's book, "I'm a Magical Girl Who Only Uses Tentacle Magic," by author Shi Ye Xiao Luo. [[17600 旁白 neutral]]
Another magical girl book. The author is an experienced writer in this genre, with good writing and no "poisonous" elements. It's more traditional, unlike stories where the protagonist immediately becomes a girl. The main character has a gradual transformation, so it's a slow burn. If you're looking for something to read, you can check it out. [[17601 旁白 neutral]]
