Chapter 240: Ningning and Xiaocheng [[20563 旁白 neutral]]
She was eating the hospital's nutritional meal plan, and thanks to Dongfang Yang's connections, Chi Xiaocheng was given the very best. [[20564 旁白 neutral]]
Due to her digestive system issues, she started with porridge and soup, but now she was slowly beginning to eat rice. With someone's help, she could also get out of bed and walk a little. [[20565 旁白 neutral]]
Her recovery was quick. She might even have a chance to go home for the New Year. [[20566 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao couldn't feel happy about it. [[20567 旁白 neutral]]
She stood by the door, her eyes reflecting the scene of Fang Ning scooping up porridge with a spoon, blowing on it gently, and holding her other hand under the spoon to prevent any drips. [[20568 旁白 neutral]]
Then, she brought it to Chi Xiaocheng's lips. [[20569 旁白 neutral]]
The girl held her light brown hair back with her fingers and lowered her head slightly to eat. [[20570 旁白 neutral]]
"She looks much more relaxed than when I fed her yesterday..." [[20571 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao whispered to herself, her heart aching. A ridiculous thought even crossed her mind. [[20572 旁白 sad]]
—Maybe I shouldn't disturb them? [[20573 苏桃 sad]]
She felt she had let down Xiaocheng, and also Fang Ning. She could only visit Xiaocheng in her spare time, while Fang Ning could be with her much more. [[20574 旁白 sad]]
And perhaps, they were just friends. [[20575 旁白 neutral]]
She shouldn't take away even this little bit of time from them. [[20576 旁白 sad]]
Although her heart ached with confusion, Su Tao remained rational. She wouldn't get angry at Fang Ning over this. [[20577 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't do anything paranoid or extreme. [[20578 旁白 neutral]]
Her strong personality, along with months of stress training, allowed Su Tao to endure things most people couldn't. [[20579 旁白 neutral]]
But if she left just like this, would it mean she was willing to give Xiaocheng up? [[20580 苏桃 sad]]
Even though the two of them might not be in that kind of relationship. [[20581 旁白 neutral]]
While she hesitated, Chi Xiaocheng noticed her and beckoned her over. "You're here. Come in." [[20582 池小橙 neutral]]
She didn't call her Taotao, not even Sister Su Tao... [[20583 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao felt a mix of emotions, but she managed to force a smile. [[20584 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng said, "You two probably haven't met before. Let me introduce you." [[20585 池小橙 neutral]]
In her persona's memory, these two had never met. [[20586 旁白 neutral]]
"Ningning, this is the sister I've always told you about, Su Tao. You might have seen her at school." [[20587 池小橙 neutral]]
Then she turned to Su Tao and looked at Fang Ning. "And this is Ningning, whom I've mentioned to you before. She's my... good friend now." [[20588 池小橙 neutral]]
Fang Ning faced Su Tao, a bright smile appearing from under her long bangs. "Hello, Sister Su Tao. It's nice to meet you. I'm Fang Ning, you can also call me Xiao Ning." [[20589 方柠 happy]]
Su Tao had never seen such a bright smile from her before. [[20590 旁白 neutral]]
Usually, the girl looked withdrawn and was cold to everyone. [[20591 旁白 neutral]]
The words "nice to meet you" seemed to imply that she didn't want their past conflicts revealed in front of Chi Xiaocheng. [[20592 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao understood her meaning and extended her hand for a handshake. "Nice to meet you. I've heard Xiaocheng mention you, but we never had the chance to meet. Xiao Ning, you're very cute." [[20593 苏桃 neutral]]
"Not at all, Sister Su Tao is the truly beautiful one. I've always wanted a sister as pretty as you." [[20594 方柠 happy]]
Fang Ning then gave an embarrassed smile. "But I'm very happy to have Sister Xiaocheng now, hehe." [[20595 方柠 happy]]
Remembering the night she, as a scarecrow, hid in the snow and overheard their argument, Chi Xiaocheng wanted to laugh seeing them act like "good sisters." [[20596 旁白 neutral]]
Taotao, this won't do. [[20597 池小橙 neutral]]
You should be showing hostility towards Fang Ning. [[20598 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled, pulled Fang Ning's arm to make her sit on the bed, and patted her head while saying to Su Tao, "You think Ningning is cute too, right? She wasn't like this at all when I found her in the snow." [[20599 池小橙 happy]]
"Her hair was dry, her skin was bad, and she was so tiny and thin." [[20600 池小橙 neutral]]
"After being cared for by Dongfang Yang for two months, she's gotten cuter and cuter." [[20601 池小橙 happy]]
She patted her head and scratched her chin. [[20602 旁白 neutral]]
Treating her just like a small pet. [[20603 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning wasn't stupid; she knew what Chi Xiaocheng was thinking and had talked with her about many things Su Tao didn't know. [[20604 旁白 neutral]]
Even so, she still enjoyed being petted like this. [[20605 方柠 happy]]
But in Su Tao's eyes? [[20606 旁白 neutral]]
This scene was like a needle piercing her heart. [[20607 旁白 sad]]
She calls her Ningning, but not me Taotao. [[20608 苏桃 sad]]
She calls her cute, but doesn't compliment my looks. [[20609 苏桃 sad]]
She pets her head and scratches her chin like that, but is so cold to me. [[20610 苏桃 sad]]
I know it's because of the memory loss, but still... [[20611 苏桃 sad]]
Pain, it's so painful! [[20612 苏桃 sad]]
The sharp pain made her throat feel tight and uncomfortable. [[20613 旁白 sad]]
It was as if two little figures were whispering in her ears. [[20614 旁白 neutral]]
The angel told her to stay true to her heart and not overthink. [[20615 旁白 neutral]]
The devil told her to act now before it was too late. [[20616 旁白 angry]]
She knew very well she was just overthinking. [[20617 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao patted her own cheeks, telling herself not to overthink, and asked the two, "How about I feed Xiaocheng?" [[20618 苏桃 neutral]]
Before Fang Ning could speak, Chi Xiaocheng answered first, "No, it's fine. Ningning can feed me." [[20619 池小橙 neutral]]
"Oh... okay." [[20620 苏桃 sad]]
As expected, rejection after rejection. [[20621 旁白 sad]]
The atmosphere between Chi Xiaocheng and Fang Ning was so harmonious that Su Tao once again felt like an outsider. [[20622 旁白 sad]]
Unable to join their conversation, she made an excuse and left, feeling dejected. [[20623 旁白 sad]]
However, as soon as she left, Fang Ning tiptoed to the window and peeked outside. [[20624 旁白 neutral]]
She turned to Chi Xiaocheng and said, "Sister Xiaocheng, Sister Su Tao has left." [[20625 方柠 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed. "She's so inflexible. Instead of looking so sad, she should have just pushed you aside forcefully." [[20626 池小橙 sad]]
Fang Ning sat back down and stuck out her tongue. "Sister Xiaocheng, I think you should stop pushing Sister Su Tao like this." [[20627 方柠 sad]]
"Why?" Chi Xiaocheng smiled faintly at Fang Ning. "Didn't you say you disliked her? Why are you speaking up for her now?" [[20628 池小橙 neutral]]
Fang Ning looked up and sniffled. "I dislike her because you almost died, Sister Xiaocheng, and she did nothing. She doesn't deserve your love. But dislike is one thing, I..." [[20629 方柠 sad]]
"I just don't want to see you like this, Sister Xiaocheng. You love her so much, yet you're so tormented and conflicted." [[20630 方柠 sad]]
Fang Ning actually knew everything; she and Chi Xiaocheng had a secret plan. [[20631 旁白 neutral]]
She even had her own little secrets that Chi Xiaocheng didn't know about. [[20632 旁白 neutral]]
But no matter what, she wanted Chi Xiaocheng to be happier and live a joyful life. [[20633 旁白 happy]]
Not like now, wanting to hug Su Tao but having to resist the urge. [[20634 旁白 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed softly. "You have a point, but it's not the right time yet. If she can't even gather the courage to take me from you, what will she do when she faces other situations?" [[20635 池小橙 sad]]
Her possessiveness probably wasn't as strong as she had thought. [[20636 旁白 neutral]]
But why? [[20637 旁白 neutral]]
Was it her strong and rational personality? [[20638 旁白 neutral]]
Or did her cluelessness in love also contribute to her hesitation now? [[20639 旁白 neutral]]
