Chapter 146: The Place Where the Dream Began [[12848 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao couldn't understand, and she didn't have time to think about it, as Chi Xiaocheng had already come over with the groceries she had bought. [[12849 旁白 neutral]]
"What's wrong, Taotao? Why are you staring into space? Didn't you sleep well?" [[12850 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao snapped out of it and quickly forced a smile. "Sorry, Xiaocheng, I'm just really tired. Maybe we should... just order takeout tonight." [[12851 苏桃 sad]]
She was no longer in the mood to cook. [[12852 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng just smiled. [[12853 旁白 neutral]]
She looked down at Da Wang, who was by her feet and looked like he wanted to snatch the fish. [[12854 旁白 neutral]]
She easily scooped up Da Wang and placed him in Su Tao's arms. "Taotao, just sit back and relax this time. I've actually been secretly watching videos to learn how to cook. Let me show you what I can do!" [[12855 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng rolled up her sleeves and walked into the kitchen, full of energy. [[12856 旁白 neutral]]
She even put on a cooking tutorial video, turning the volume up loud and setting it aside. [[12857 旁白 neutral]]
She had always known how to cook; she just thought acting a little helpless would be more charming in front of the person she liked. [[12858 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao watched Chi Xiaocheng's busy figure from behind, lost in thought. [[12859 旁白 neutral]]
This scene seemed so familiar, as if she had seen it somewhere before. [[12860 旁白 neutral]]
It was like... in the past... [[12861 旁白 neutral]]
No, the Xiaocheng of today was completely different from the person she used to be. [[12862 苏桃 sad]]
The love that Chi Xiaocheng had always hidden was now pouring out in their day-to-day life. [[12863 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao instinctively hid her phone and said to Chi Xiaocheng in the kitchen, "Xiaocheng, I'm going to my room to rest for a bit. Can you call me when dinner is ready?" [[12864 苏桃 sad]]
"Of course!" [[12865 池小橙 happy]]
After Chi Xiaocheng agreed, Su Tao rushed into her room and quickly messaged Si Chen to get an update on the situation. [[12866 旁白 neutral]]
Long Mian was rushed to the hospital, but his life wasn't in danger. [[12867 旁白 neutral]]
The professor was lightly injured. Although the school tried its best to suppress the incident, rumors were still spreading. [[12868 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed Ye Liang had also found out about Chi Xiaocheng's situation and was secretly making things worse. [[12869 旁白 neutral]]
In terms of public reputation and discussion, Su Tao was completely unaffected, but Chi Xiaocheng was a different story. [[12870 旁白 neutral]]
If these two incidents weren't handled properly, she could be in serious trouble. [[12871 旁白 neutral]]
It was surprising that Su Tao had her phone at a time like this. [[12872 旁白 neutral]]
But Si Chen still said, "You should keep a close watch on Chi Xiaocheng. Like we said this morning, accept and love everything about her. This time, you can't just pretend. Even if you don't like it, you have to force yourself to love her." [[12873 司辰 neutral]]
"Chi Xiaocheng's yandere tendencies are very serious. You're the only one who can calm her down. Otherwise, if she keeps going down this path, she might never be able to recover." [[12874 司辰 neutral]]
That's what he said. [[12875 旁白 neutral]]
But after thinking about it all day, she still couldn't make up her mind. [[12876 旁白 neutral]]
She knew her own situation and was instinctively afraid of how Chi Xiaocheng was now. [[12877 旁白 neutral]]
Just like she said from the beginning, the love of a yandere was too heavy to bear. [[12878 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen: "You haven't messaged me back. Have you made up your mind or not?" [[12879 司辰 angry]]
Seeing this message, Su Tao's breath caught in her throat. [[12880 旁白 neutral]]
Her finger trembled as she typed out the words, "I... I'll try." [[12881 苏桃 sad]]
Si Chen sent a question mark: "?" [[12882 司辰 angry]]
Si Chen: "If you're still hesitating and avoiding it after all this, then don't contact me again. I'm afraid Chi Xiaocheng will stab me and I'll lose a kidney." [[12883 司辰 angry]]
"You're too hesitant to act, and you don't dare to talk things over with Chi Xiaocheng. Are you even the Su Tao I know? You might as well just send Chi Xiaocheng to a mental hospital." [[12884 司辰 angry]]
It was the same kind of argument Dongfang Yang would make, but it was also what Si Chen truly thought. [[12885 旁白 neutral]]
Before, Chi Xiaocheng's dark side needed a password to activate. [[12886 旁白 neutral]]
Now it was her default state, so what was the point? [[12887 旁白 neutral]]
It was even difficult to communicate with her. Didn't that mean he, Si Chen, wouldn't even have a chance to be a useful tool? [[12888 旁白 neutral]]
He felt that he had to push Su Tao one more time. [[12889 旁白 neutral]]
As for whether she could handle it... [[12890 旁白 neutral]]
Well... [[12891 旁白 neutral]]
Never love Tao, but always believe in Tao. [[12892 旁白 neutral]]
After saying this, Si Chen really went silent. [[12893 旁白 neutral]]
Even her "strategist," who had always given her advice, was saying this, and he had the same opinion as Dongfang Yang. Did she, Su Tao, have any other choice? [[12894 旁白 neutral]]
She had none! [[12895 旁白 angry]]
Then... I'll try! [[12896 苏桃 sad]]
Biting her tongue hard, Su Tao even slapped her own cheeks to force herself to pull it together. [[12897 旁白 neutral]]
Her breathing became rapid, but she kept telling herself she really wanted to force herself to love Xiaocheng. [[12898 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know how much time had passed until a delicious smell wafted into the room and Chi Xiaocheng shouted from outside, "Taotao, it's time to eat!" [[12899 池小橙 happy]]
When Su Tao finally came to her senses, her eyes were already bloodshot. [[12900 旁白 neutral]]
She got up from her chair and walked toward the living room. [[12901 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even notice that her steps were already a bit unsteady. [[12902 旁白 neutral]]
She kept trying to convince herself, but she didn't know that unless it reached the point of hypnosis, this determination born from fear was just a protective shell. [[12903 旁白 neutral]]
And it was incredibly fragile. [[12904 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps knowing she was under a lot of stress, Chi Xiaocheng didn't say much after they finished eating. [[12905 旁白 neutral]]
This made Su Tao, who had mentally prepared herself, feel like she had punched a fistful of cotton. [[12906 旁白 neutral]]
As a result, she ate the meal that Chi Xiaocheng had prepared so carefully with a distracted mind. [[12907 旁白 neutral]]
It was delicious, but she was in no mood to appreciate it. [[12908 旁白 neutral]]
As night approached. [[12909 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng handed Su Tao a stress-relief pill. "Taotao, take this before bed. It will help you sleep well. You look really pale right now, and it makes me worry." [[12910 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao was indeed on the verge of a breakdown. [[12911 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng, who had recognized her own issues and regained much of her sanity, could see this. [[12912 旁白 neutral]]
The stress-relief pill from the System's lottery came at just the right time. [[12913 旁白 neutral]]
She put the pill down and walked toward the living room. "Taotao, wait a moment, I'll get you a glass of water." [[12914 池小橙 neutral]]
As she turned, she didn't notice Su Tao's expression turn awful. The determination she had managed to build up shattered instantly. [[12915 旁白 sad]]
A pill... [[12916 苏桃 sad]]
Hahaha... hahahaha... [[12917 苏桃 sad]]
A stress-relief pill? That has to be a lie, right? [[12918 苏桃 sad]]
Just like in the dark room last time, she would eat it, fall into a deep sleep, and wake up powerless, unable to do anything, reliving the same scene all over again. [[12919 苏桃 sad]]
It's fake, the stress-relief pill is a lie! [[12920 苏桃 angry]]
How could I eat this? I will never eat this! [[12921 苏桃 angry]]
While Chi Xiaocheng was gone, Su Tao quickly hid the pill. When Chi Xiaocheng returned with the water. [[12922 旁白 neutral]]
She immediately snatched the water. "This pill is so bitter, yuck!" [[12923 苏桃 sad]]
She pretended she had already taken the pill to get it over with. [[12924 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't think much of it and gently hugged Su Tao as they lay down in bed. "Well... goodnight?" [[12925 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yeah, sweet dreams." [[12926 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao turned slightly to her side, her mouth open but unable to say anything more. [[12927 旁白 neutral]]
The person in her arms was warm, a hundred times more comfortable than the warm air from the heater. [[12928 旁白 neutral]]
But in her heart, she felt no sense of comfort at all. [[12929 旁白 sad]]
In the dim moonlight, she stared blankly at the couple figurine. [[12930 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but wonder if there was truly no other way out besides the terrifying ending in her dream. [[12931 旁白 sad]]
Her eyelids grew heavier, and Su Tao couldn't hold on any longer, gradually falling asleep. [[12932 旁白 neutral]]
But when she opened her eyes again, she found she wasn't in her room. [[12933 旁白 neutral]]
She was in the familiar basement. [[12934 旁白 neutral]]
The "her" in front of her was tied to the bed, while Chi Xiaocheng sat beside her, holding the familiar fruit knife. [[12935 旁白 neutral]]
"Is this another dream?" [[12936 苏桃 sad]]
And this time, she was back where it all began. [[12937 旁白 neutral]]
