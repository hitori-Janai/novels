Chapter 234: Longing to See Xiaocheng, Sick with Missing Her [[20105 旁白 neutral]]
"Within a certain period of time?" [[20106 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't quite understand what Dr. Cheng meant, but she felt she could satisfy all of Xiaocheng's needs. [[20107 旁白 neutral]]
As long as Xiaocheng asked for it, she would do it. [[20108 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Yes, the girl I was treating was in a rather serious condition. To make the person she liked keep liking her, she was willing to risk breaking the law to get rid of other people." [[20109 成医生 neutral]]
"The boy she liked also liked her a little, but he didn't want her to continue being so unstable, so he came to me." [[20110 成医生 neutral]]
"The research and testing process was very long, so I won't go into detail." [[20111 成医生 neutral]]
"In the end, we found that most yandere girls are extremely insecure and feel they aren't getting what they believe they deserve, which is why they become obsessive." [[20112 成医生 neutral]]
"In the girl's mind, the boy belonged only to her and should only love her. But the boy had many friends, both male and female, which was the biggest source of her insecurity." [[20113 成医生 neutral]]
"Later, through talking, we learned what the girl wanted and longed for the most. Since the boy also liked her, he completely cut off contact with the outside world for a month." [[20114 成医生 neutral]]
"He was a big anime fan, but he even stopped paying attention to his favorite characters. He stayed by the girl's side, taking care of her and loving her with all his heart." [[20115 成医生 neutral]]
"During that time, he constantly used words to guide and reassure her. He also used small opportunities to show her that friends were just friends, but she was his one and only, forever." [[20116 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng's typing wasn't very fast. He would pause for more than twenty seconds after each sentence, which felt like a cat scratching at Su Tao's heart. [[20117 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao: "And then, Dr. Cheng? Was the girl's yandere obsession cured just like that?" [[20118 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "It's not that simple. This is a long-term treatment. For now, the girl's emotions have stabilized. Through some gentle guidance, we've even had her meet the boy's friends to confirm they are not a threat." [[20119 成医生 neutral]]
"Slowly, her restrictions on the boy have become more relaxed, and the chances of her having an episode have decreased." [[20120 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Miss Taozi, I think you understand what I mean. Your friend Xiaocheng is still in the early stages of being a yandere, so this method will definitely be useful." [[20121 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Satisfy all her needs, give her a sense of security, and it would be best to confirm your relationship with her. Let her know that even if you go out to see friends, you will still be thinking of her." [[20122 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "With time and the influence of surrounding events, it's not difficult to change a person's temperament." [[20123 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "By the way, you sent a message before saying Miss Xiaocheng was seriously ill. I've been too busy to ask about her condition. How is she now? Has her yandere side gotten worse?" [[20124 成医生 neutral]]
Reading Dr. Cheng's words, Su Tao gave a bitter smile and explained what had happened during this time. [[20125 旁白 neutral]]
She trusted Dr. Cheng a lot, and since he already knew about Chi Xiaocheng's situation, Su Tao told him everything. [[20126 旁白 neutral]]
Except for one thing. [[20127 旁白 neutral]]
She described Chi Xiaocheng's return from death as a serious injury that left her in a coma, from which she had only just woken up a few days ago. [[20128 旁白 neutral]]
A drastic change in personality, emotional numbness, memory loss... [[20129 旁白 neutral]]
After understanding the situation, Dr. Cheng typed a long series of dots, indicating his silence. [[20130 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao asked the same question as Chengcheng, "Dr. Cheng, do you think I should try to awaken Xiaocheng's memories?" [[20131 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Actually, when you hesitate, you already have the answer in your heart." [[20132 成医生 neutral]]
True hesitation is often caused by the influence of many external factors. [[20133 旁白 neutral]]
When you hesitate about whether to stay up late, you already want to stay up late deep down. [[20134 旁白 neutral]]
You only hesitate because you're worried about your health and how it will affect you the next day. [[20135 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "For a choice like this, you shouldn't rely on others' opinions. Just follow your own heart. For now, you can start by apologizing to her and restoring your relationship." [[20136 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "If she can't recover her memories and is no longer a yandere, then what I said before is useless." [[20137 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng's words made Su Tao's eyes light up. [[20138 旁白 happy]]
That's right! This morning Dongfang Yang already told Xiaocheng that Ye Liang was dead. He even took my side and said that me hating her was just a misunderstanding. [[20139 苏桃 happy]]
Next, all I have to do is apologize, and maybe our relationship will be restored soon! [[20140 苏桃 happy]]
I can decide whether to awaken her memories after that, right? [[20141 苏桃 neutral]]
If I can talk with Xiaocheng, I won't be so affected by the thought of her hating me, and I can think more rationally. [[20142 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Thank you for your guidance, Dr. Cheng. How about this? Dr. Cheng, I'd like to invite you to Jiuzhou City to see Xiaocheng." [[20143 苏桃 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Ah?" [[20144 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao: "Didn't you say when we first met that you would be free in about three months? It's been three months now, and that yandere girl has recovered, so..." [[20145 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao: "You're free, right?" [[20146 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao: "You don't have to worry about the money. I... I have a brother named Dongfang Yang, and he's very rich!" [[20147 苏桃 neutral]]
Even though I really don't have any money left. [[20148 苏桃 sad]]
But... Dongfang Yang, you're a good person. I'm really going to owe you again this time. [[20149 苏桃 neutral]]
In her heart, Su Tao gave Dongfang Yang another "good person card" and waited expectantly for Dr. Cheng's reply. [[20150 旁白 neutral]]
The other person seemed to be a bit sensitive about this topic and only replied after a while. [[20151 旁白 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Ahem, to be honest with you, I'm actually on my annual leave now. My wife and child are at home, and I just promised to take my daughter to Disney before the Spring Festival, so... I'm sorry." [[20152 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "Besides, Miss Xiaocheng is still suffering from amnesia. Let's wait until after she recovers her memory, or at least until I'm back at work after the Spring Festival." [[20153 成医生 neutral]]
Dr. Cheng: "But don't worry, the WeChat you added is my personal account. I check it regularly, so I'll reply if you have any questions." [[20154 成医生 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the message, feeling a little disappointed. [[20155 苏桃 sad]]
She was in such a hurry to get Dr. Cheng to diagnose Xiaocheng that she forgot he would want to be with his family for the upcoming Spring Festival. [[20156 旁白 sad]]
After exchanging a few more simple words, she ended the chat with Dr. Cheng, promising to keep in touch. Su Tao then put down her phone and stared blankly at the night view. [[20157 旁白 neutral]]
"Can I go and apologize to Xiaocheng now?" [[20158 苏桃 neutral]]
"After Dongfang Yang told her Ye Liang was dead, what did Xiaocheng think? Will she forgive me?" [[20159 苏桃 neutral]]
But an apology needs a gift. [[20160 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao was too embarrassed to go to Chi Xiaocheng's hospital room empty-handed. [[20161 旁白 neutral]]
But she really missed Xiaocheng! [[20162 苏桃 sad]]
She wanted to chat with Xiaocheng, feed her fruit, hear her call her 'Taotao', sleep with her, be wrapped up in her messy, octopus-like sleeping posture, and experience her suffocating and obsessive love... [[20163 旁白 neutral]]
The image of Fang Ning and others happily talking with Chi Xiaocheng flashed through her mind. [[20164 旁白 neutral]]
The fluttering in her heart grew stronger. [[20165 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took a deep breath and saw a street vendor packing up across the road from the hospital entrance. It looked like he had a few sticks of tanghulu left. [[20166 旁白 neutral]]
"I want to see Xiaocheng—!" [[20167 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao shouted at the night sky from the balcony and then ran towards the stairs. [[20168 旁白 happy]]
Maybe tanghulu is a bit too simple for a gift. [[20169 苏桃 neutral]]
I want to see her! [[20170 苏桃 happy]]
Right now! [[20171 苏桃 happy]]
