Chapter 172: Meeting Chengcheng [[15018 旁白 neutral]]
"Going out"—these words felt distant to Su Tao now. [[15019 旁白 sad]]
Her life used to be very full and busy. [[15020 旁白 neutral]]
But after losing Chi Xiaocheng, she realized she had no reason to go out anymore. [[15021 旁白 sad]]
What was the point of studying so hard? Who was she building a good future for? And there was no need to work part-time for living expenses, since she didn't have to buy groceries and cook for Xiaocheng. [[15022 苏桃 sad]]
She ate her meals at home, all alone. [[15023 旁白 sad]]
She would go to bed at night and sleep until noon. She'd cook enough rice for both lunch and dinner, scramble a couple of eggs, and not go out to buy anything. She wouldn't even spend 10 yuan a day. [[15024 旁白 neutral]]
"There was no point in going out. Besides, there was no one to go with her anymore." [[15025 苏桃 sad]]
But a slightly annoyed voice came from the phone, "What? Don't tell me you're still lying on the sofa?" [[15026 程程 angry]]
Chengcheng's reminder came again, making Su Tao freeze for a moment. [[15027 旁白 neutral]]
She was, in fact, still lying on the sofa. [[15028 旁白 neutral]]
"How could she guess I'm still on the sofa?" [[15029 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao muttered to herself, but still got up and walked to her room. "Wait a moment, I'm going to change my clothes." [[15030 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao picked up her phone and glanced out the window. [[15031 旁白 neutral]]
The sun was shining brightly in the clear sky. [[15032 旁白 neutral]]
It was a rare sunny day in winter, and the temperature was mild enough that she didn't need to wear a heavy down jacket. [[15033 旁白 neutral]]
She went back to her room and took off her pajamas. [[15034 旁白 neutral]]
"Hiss!" [[15035 池小橙 happy]]
Suddenly, she thought she heard the sound of someone taking a sharp breath. [[15036 旁白 neutral]]
Did it come from inside the room? [[15037 苏桃 neutral]]
Or was it Chengcheng on the phone? [[15038 苏桃 neutral]]
The sound wasn't loud, so Su Tao couldn't hear it clearly, but she felt a faint sense of being watched. [[15039 旁白 neutral]]
She looked around; the curtains were completely drawn. [[15040 旁白 neutral]]
It felt a little strange, but... it didn't seem unpleasant. [[15041 苏桃 neutral]]
Of course, Su Tao didn't know that while she was changing, a scarecrow doll hidden in the corner was forcefully covering its mouth. [[15042 旁白 neutral]]
The doll's little hands were so short that it struggled to cover its mouth. [[15043 旁白 neutral]]
Luckily, it was daytime. Even if the scarecrow's strange red eyes were glowing, no one would notice. [[15044 旁白 neutral]]
It had been over two months. [[15045 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng never expected that after sleeping with Su Tao so many times and even kissing her, she had rarely seen a scene like this! [[15046 池小橙 happy]]
Who would have thought she would accidentally see such an intimate scene only after her death? [[15047 池小橙 happy]]
"Forgive me, forgive me. I'm not peeking at Taotao on purpose, I just can't take my eyes off her because I like her so much." [[15048 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng, now a small doll, silently chanted to herself that form is emptiness, and then boldly watched. [[15049 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help it. She was a doll, she couldn't move, and she couldn't look away. [[15050 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao changed her clothes quickly. [[15051 旁白 neutral]]
She wore a gray knit sweater underneath and a brown cotton sweatshirt on top. For her bottoms, she initially thought of wearing a pair of thermal tights. [[15052 旁白 neutral]]
But then she remembered something Chi Xiaocheng once said. [[15053 旁白 neutral]]
—You can't wear these outside, only at home! [[15054 池小橙 angry]]
That was the possessiveness of a yandere. [[15055 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking about it now, wasn't being possessed like that a form of happiness? [[15056 苏桃 happy]]
Su Tao changed into a simple pair of cotton pants, then picked up her phone and walked out the door. "Chengcheng, are you still there?" [[15057 苏桃 neutral]]
She didn't get a response until she was in the living room. "That's weird, the call is still connected." [[15058 苏桃 neutral]]
A moment later, just as she was about to leave, a voice came from the phone. "Ahhh, I just stubbed my toe on a chair. I went to put something on it. Are you ready to go?" [[15059 程程 neutral]]
"Yeah, I'll wait for you at Yangyang Cat Cafe?" [[15060 苏桃 neutral]]
"OK, it'll take me half an hour by bus. You can go ahead." [[15061 程程 neutral]]
"Okay." [[15062 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao hung up the phone, stepped outside, but then turned around and went back into Chi Xiaocheng's room. [[15063 旁白 neutral]]
"King is leaving, I'll take you back to your old home." [[15064 苏桃 neutral]]
"Meow?" [[15065 大王 neutral]]
She took a deep breath only when the warm sunlight touched her skin and the mixed scent of snow and dust filled her nose. [[15066 旁白 neutral]]
"I haven't been out for so long, I'm not used to it." [[15067 苏桃 neutral]]
She took out her phone again, using the screen as a mirror. [[15068 旁白 neutral]]
Her hair was a bit messy, and she looked a little tired. [[15069 旁白 neutral]]
She reached into her pocket for a hair tie to tie up her long hair, but after fumbling for a moment, she realized she hadn't brought one. [[15070 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng, do you have an extra hair tie? Let me borrow..." [[15071 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao instinctively looked to her side. [[15072 旁白 neutral]]
Her words stopped suddenly. [[15073 旁白 sad]]
Forget it, she couldn't be bothered to tie her hair anyway. The person who used to praise her beautiful hair was gone. [[15074 苏桃 sad]]
She went out and grabbed a shared bike. [[15075 旁白 neutral]]
Enjoying the cool breeze on her face, Su Tao soon arrived at Yangyang Cat Cafe first. [[15076 旁白 neutral]]
Before the bike even came to a complete stop, King jumped out of the basket and ran excitedly toward the cafe. [[15077 旁白 happy]]
"Huh? King, why are you back?" [[15078 徐然 neutral]]
Xu Ran, holding a small kitten, opened the door for the approaching King. [[15079 旁白 neutral]]
"Meow!" [[15080 大王 happy]]
King meowed, as if greeting Xu Ran, then entered the cafe, seemingly ready to reassert his dominance. [[15081 旁白 neutral]]
Xu Ran looked up again and saw Su Tao walking over. "Miss Xu, sorry to bother you again." [[15082 苏桃 neutral]]
"Welcome. This cat cafe is pretty quiet. I'd be happy to have more people to chat with." [[15083 徐然 happy]]
Xu Ran also opened the door for Su Tao, then looked around. [[15084 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao asked, puzzled, "What are you looking for?" [[15085 苏桃 neutral]]
"Nothing." Xu Ran asked curiously, "Didn't your Orange come with you?" [[15086 徐然 neutral]]
Suddenly, Su Tao's relaxed smile stiffened. [[15087 旁白 neutral]]
Then it slowly faded. [[15088 旁白 sad]]
"She's... busy right now. I'm here to meet a friend from online." [[15089 苏桃 sad]]
"Oh, I see. Please come in. What would you like to drink? Coffee?" [[15090 徐然 neutral]]
Su Tao scanned the QR code and paid two hundred yuan. She originally wanted to get a glass of juice, but after glancing at the menu, she fell silent for a moment. [[15091 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll have an orange Americano... with extra sugar." [[15092 苏桃 sad]]
Then Su Tao sat in the same chair as last time, staring blankly at a blanket where the cats were gathered. [[15093 旁白 sad]]
Last time, Xiaocheng had been on that blanket, and then she brought King home. [[15094 旁白 sad]]
Now, King was still on the blanket, commanding his little followers, but the cute girl with long, tea-colored hair was gone. [[15095 旁白 sad]]
This place was also one of Su Tao's few beautiful memories. [[15096 旁白 sad]]
After about fifteen minutes, the cafe door opened with a "ding." [[15097 旁白 neutral]]
A small girl with long brown hair, wearing a mismatched gray overcoat, slipped in from outside. [[15098 旁白 neutral]]
She was wearing black-framed glasses and was blowing warm air onto her hands as she entered. "Whoa, the sun's out, but it's still so cold. Thank goodness for the heater in here, I'm alive." [[15099 程程 happy]]
The girl looked around, her gaze pausing on Xu Ran for a few seconds. [[15100 旁白 neutral]]
Then she turned to Su Tao, took off her glasses to get a better look, and put them back on. "Hello, you must be Taozi, right? Sorry I'm late." [[15101 程程 happy]]
But Su Tao just stared at the girl, stunned. "Xiaocheng?" [[15102 苏桃 sad]]
The girl's smile froze for a split second. [[15103 旁白 neutral]]
Then she naturally walked over to Su Tao's side. "Well, some people call me Xiao Cheng, but most people call me Chengcheng." [[15104 程程 neutral]]
