Chapter 166: A Complete Break [[14517 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen was in a very, very bad mood. [[14518 旁白 neutral]]
Three days ago, after Su Tao gave him the small note, he spent over two hours analyzing it with Dongfang Yang, Chi Song, and Long Ge. [[14519 旁白 neutral]]
The relic was definitely a fake. [[14520 旁白 neutral]]
Something was off about Lin Fangya and Xiao Ming. No one knew where Ye Liang had hidden them; it was as if they had vanished into thin air. [[14521 旁白 neutral]]
As for Chi Xiaocheng's parents, an investigation revealed that Ye Liang had indeed sent people to hold them hostage, but Long Ge had sent several of his men to their hometown a long time ago. [[14522 旁白 neutral]]
His original intention was that he felt bad for his underlings who had fought for him and ended up with serious injuries. [[14523 旁白 neutral]]
He gave them a large sum of money and let them retire in Chi Song's hometown, asking them to look after Chi Song's parents as well. [[14524 旁白 neutral]]
Coincidentally, the men Ye Liang sent this time ran right into this group of retirees. [[14525 旁白 neutral]]
The large group of retired underlings transformed into village tyrants and easily protected Chi Xiaocheng's parents. [[14526 旁白 neutral]]
But the thing that concerned them the most was the news about Su Tao's father! [[14527 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen had been keeping a close watch on Su Tao's father for a long time, checking for any news every day, and now Ye Liang had dangled this bait! [[14528 旁白 neutral]]
He began to analyze the note day and night, speculating that the "Ju Ju You Ni Hotel" was just a cover, and that Ye Liang would surely take Su Tao to a more secret, dark, and dangerous place. [[14529 旁白 neutral]]
So, he made countless plans to ensure they would know Su Tao's situation immediately, no matter where she was. [[14530 旁白 neutral]]
Then they would send people to capture Ye Liang! [[14531 旁白 neutral]]
However, Si Chen had calculated everything, except for the fact that Ye Liang was actually an idiot! [[14532 旁白 neutral]]
He actually took Su Tao to the Ju Ju You Ni Grand Hotel. [[14533 旁白 neutral]]
He was a thousand percent sure the hotel was just a front, so he had only sent a few people to watch it, with the main focus elsewhere. [[14534 旁白 neutral]]
By the time he realized his mistake and quickly redeployed his men, Su Tao had already arrived at the hotel entrance in the driver's car. [[14535 旁白 neutral]]
"Stall for time, don't go into the hotel." [[14536 司辰 angry]]
She didn't listen. [[14537 旁白 neutral]]
She insisted on putting herself in danger. [[14538 旁白 neutral]]
And now, Si Chen was growing even more anxious. [[14539 旁白 neutral]]
He continued to shout into the earpiece, "Su Tao, don't be impulsive! Ye Liang is still the young master of the Ye family in the capital. Even though you can beat him, he has so many bodyguards. If you get caught and threatened, it will be very difficult for us to save you!" [[14540 司辰 angry]]
However, standing in front of Ye Liang, Su Tao's anger was unstoppable. "Sorry, I can't hold back." [[14541 苏桃 angry]]
Ye Liang raised an eyebrow, a bit confused by her words. "What are you talking about?" [[14542 叶良 neutral]]
"Nothing." [[14543 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao replied and turned towards the kitchen. [[14544 旁白 neutral]]
The presidential suite had everything, not to mention this was a place Ye Liang often stayed, so the coffee machine was right there. [[14545 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao got to work and boiled a pot of scalding water. [[14546 旁白 neutral]]
After a while, she walked out with a cup of coffee. [[14547 旁白 neutral]]
The steaming hot coffee made Ye Liang frown. "I usually like my coffee iced. Don't tell me you forgot. There are ingredients in the fridge for you to use." [[14548 叶良 neutral]]
Su Tao stood before Ye Liang, holding the coffee, and spoke faintly, "I just want to know one thing. Why did you kill Xiaocheng?" [[14549 苏桃 angry]]
"Kill?" [[14550 叶良 neutral]]
Ye Liang shrugged with a smile. "I already told you, Lin Fangya did it. I didn't lay a hand on Chi Xiaocheng. I forgave her a long time ago." [[14551 叶良 neutral]]
His face was rather handsome, and with the male lead's halo, a smile like that could really boost his appeal. [[14552 旁白 neutral]]
Combined with his wealthy persona, ordinary girls wouldn't be able to resist. [[14553 旁白 neutral]]
However, Ye Liang's male lead halo was gone. [[14554 旁白 neutral]]
In Su Tao's eyes, his image had already hit rock bottom. That smile was just disgusting. [[14555 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao: "I'll ask again, why did you kill Xiaocheng?" [[14556 苏桃 angry]]
Her voice was incredibly cold. [[14557 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang frowned in displeasure, "What kind of attitude is that!" [[14558 叶良 angry]]
He straightened up and slammed his hand on the table. "I've already humbled myself and given you a chance to reconcile, and you're still bringing up that Chi Xiaocheng? She's already dead—arghhhh!" [[14559 叶良 angry]]
Before he could finish, Su Tao threw the cup of scalding coffee in his face. [[14560 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't just a mix of hot water and coffee beans; Su Tao had also poured a large amount of chili powder into it. [[14561 旁白 neutral]]
As Ye Liang screamed, half of his face instantly turned red from the burn, his expression twisting in agony. [[14562 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen was still shouting in Su Tao's earpiece. [[14563 旁白 neutral]]
However, the girl, having lost her patience, had already taken off the earpiece and thrown it aside. [[14564 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice became utterly cold. "Ye Liang, I'll ask you one more time, why did you kill my Xiaocheng!" [[14565 苏桃 angry]]
She was my one and only! [[14566 苏桃 sad]]
With her enemy right in front of her, Su Tao thought she was already showing great restraint by being able to talk rationally. [[14567 旁白 neutral]]
In the first two days after Chi Xiaocheng's death, she would have stabbed Ye Liang with a knife the moment she saw him. [[14568 旁白 neutral]]
Not like now, where she could still hold on to a sliver of patience to talk with him. [[14569 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at that disgusting face. [[14570 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang clutched his face in pain. Because the coffee was mixed with a large amount of chili powder, he couldn't even open one of his eyes. [[14571 旁白 neutral]]
The nerves in the face are sensitive, and the combination of scalding heat and spiciness made Ye Liang's face contort, completely losing his earlier composure. [[14572 旁白 neutral]]
He leaned on the sofa, his face ashen like a ghost's. "Su Tao! It seems you'd rather do this the hard way!" [[14573 叶良 angry]]
"Did you really think I wouldn't touch you just because I was being nice? Chi Xiaocheng is already dead, and you still have to mention that little bitch!" [[14574 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao's eyes suddenly deepened, as if they were about to glow red. [[14575 旁白 neutral]]
With a "swish," she pulled out a fruit knife hidden in her pocket and lunged straight at Ye Liang. [[14576 旁白 neutral]]
But Ye Liang was prepared. Enduring the pain, he rolled over behind the sofa, easily dodging Su Tao's stab, and laughed loudly at the same time, "Hahaha! Getting antsy so soon? I was thinking of having a nice chat with you, but it seems that's not necessary anymore." [[14577 叶良 angry]]
"Yes, I sent people to kill Chi Xiaocheng, so what?" [[14578 叶良 angry]]
Standing behind the sofa, Ye Liang didn't notice that because she had used too much force, the knife not only pierced the sofa, but Su Tao's hand had gone into it as well. [[14579 旁白 neutral]]
From the outside, it looked like Su Tao had punched a hole right through the sofa. [[14580 旁白 neutral]]
But from Ye Liang's perspective, Su Tao had simply pounced onto the sofa due to her emotional instability. [[14581 旁白 neutral]]
This kneeling-like posture only fueled his desire to conquer her. [[14582 旁白 neutral]]
The words continued to spill from his mouth. [[14583 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, Su Tao, Su Tao, if you hadn't opposed me, with a face like yours, you could have become one of my concubines, living a life of luxury. I could buy you anything you want." [[14584 叶良 angry]]
"Countless women dream of such a happy life." [[14585 叶良 angry]]
"But you're also a fool. You were given a chance and you didn't take it. What were you thinking, opposing me for Chi Xiaocheng? You don't really think you alone can fight against my Ye family, do you?" [[14586 叶良 angry]]
"Oh, right, and Chi Xiaocheng." Ye Liang seemed to remember something and laughed coldly. "It's a pity she died like that. After all, she was quite cute without makeup. A little loli must taste pretty good, right?" [[14587 叶良 angry]]
