Chapter 96: I Told You She Likes Xiaocheng

At Youth Square, Chen Qian and Xiao Wei were on their way to the counseling room. [[8360 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Wei, who had left wearing only her pajamas, was shivering from the cold despite borrowing a coat from Chen Qian, and she was no longer sleepy. [[8361 旁白 neutral]]
As she walked, she asked Chen Qian, "Is it really okay for us to help Chi Xiaocheng trick Taozi like this?" [[8362 小唯 sad]]
Chen Qian stood beside her, blocking the wind, and explained, "Xiao Wei, you must have noticed it too. Chi Xiaocheng likes Su Tao, and Su Tao always talks about her in the dorm. We're just playing matchmaker, so how can you call it tricking?" [[8363 陈倩 happy]]
Xiao Wei said, "Qianqian, you're twisting things a bit." [[8364 小唯 neutral]]
Chen Qian shrugged. "A while ago, you were the one who said it would be fun to help. But if you feel bad for Su Tao, I just won't wake you up next time you're sleeping in." [[8365 陈倩 neutral]]
"Hey, don't do that!" [[8366 小唯 sad]]
Xiao Wei was a little anxious. "I'm not saying I won't do it. It's super interesting to watch our awkward and proud Taozi slowly fall in love, and it's between two girls! It's the first time I've seen this in real life." [[8367 小唯 happy]]
"And it's happening right next to me!" [[8368 小唯 happy]]
Xiao Wei's eyes were sparkling. "If we can get them together, I'll be able to brag about it wherever I go." [[8369 小唯 happy]]
Her tone changed, and she smiled sheepishly. "I just feel a little guilty. You see how Taozi tiptoes when she gets up, and she's quiet when brushing her teeth so she doesn't wake me. It feels wrong to force her into this." [[8370 小唯 sad]]
Chen Qian tapped the back of Xiao Wei's head. "If Su Tao didn't like Chi Xiaocheng, then forcing it would be wrong. But she clearly cares about Chi Xiaocheng. Maybe she likes her and doesn't even know it." [[8371 陈倩 happy]]
No matter what Xiao Wei chose, Chen Qian was already firmly on Team Xiaocheng. [[8372 旁白 neutral]]
She had once been hostile towards Su Tao because of Ye Liang. [[8373 旁白 neutral]]
Now she understood things better, but she still didn't particularly like Su Tao. [[8374 旁白 neutral]]
Helping Chi Xiaocheng manipulate her, watching her fall into the trap without realizing it, and feeling all sorts of guilt and regret was just too satisfying! [[8375 旁白 happy]]
The sense of accomplishment was off the charts! [[8376 旁白 happy]]
No wonder there were so many trolls online, and Xiao Wei also enjoyed being one. This kind of real-life drama was rare. [[8377 旁白 neutral]]
Not to mention, the reward Chi Xiaocheng offered was hard to refuse. [[8378 旁白 neutral]]
As for poison? [[8379 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't care. She understood that Chi Xiaocheng only cared about Su Tao. Although a bit obsessive, she wasn't the type to harm people. "I'm just an ordinary person, so I'll stand by her. In a society with laws, she can't really kill me, right?" [[8380 旁白 neutral]]
After thinking it over, Chen Qian nudged Xiao Wei again. "So, are you in or not? Chi Xiaocheng has some amazing products that can make you prettier. I can get some for you." [[8381 陈倩 happy]]
"Amazing products? Can you really trust them?" [[8382 小唯 neutral]]
"Forget it, you don't have anxiety about your looks, so you don't understand how I feel." [[8383 陈倩 sad]]
Chen Qian was a classic 7-out-of-10 girl, the "decent but plain" type, with a very common face. [[8384 旁白 neutral]]
If she wasn't careful about her figure and skincare, she would lose her shape. With special effort and makeup, she could barely reach a 7.5. [[8385 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Wei was different. She had a small, round face and big eyes. Perhaps because she slept a lot and rarely went out, her skin was fair, and she was an 8-out-of-10 beauty even without makeup. [[8386 旁白 neutral]]
With only three people in the dorm, Chen Qian was envious of both of their looks. [[8387 旁白 neutral]]
As they were talking, they saw Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao walking towards them. Chen Qian nudged Xiao Wei's shoulder, "See? They're even holding hands." [[8388 陈倩 happy]]
Xiao Wei looked over in surprise. "It's normal for girls to hold hands, isn't it? I see guys with their arms around each other's shoulders too." [[8389 小唯 neutral]]
"Watch this." [[8390 陈倩 happy]]
After speaking, Chen Qian raised her hand and shouted, "Su Tao, over here!" [[8391 陈倩 happy]]
Su Tao heard her and walked over, still holding Chi Xiaocheng's hand. She was also carrying a down coat. "Xiao Wei, you came out without a jacket. Aren't you afraid of catching a cold? I brought it for you." [[8392 苏桃 neutral]]
Taking the coat, Chen Qian gave Chi Xiaocheng a look. "Xiaocheng, could you wait over there for a moment? I have something I want to ask Su Tao." [[8393 陈倩 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng gave Chen Qian a puzzled look. [[8394 池小橙 neutral]]
Although she didn't know what Chen Qian wanted to do, she obediently stepped away. [[8395 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao asked, "What is it that you can't say in front of Xiaocheng?" [[8396 苏桃 neutral]]
Chen Qian asked in a low voice, "Su Tao, do you like Chi Xiaocheng?" [[8397 陈倩 neutral]]
Hearing this, Xiao Wei's eyes lit up. [[8398 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao paused, looking at Chen Qian in confusion. "What are you talking about? I just think of Xiaocheng as a little sister." [[8399 苏桃 neutral]]
Xiao Wei yawned and said, "But with Xiaocheng's condition, don't you have to like her?" [[8400 小唯 neutral]]
Su Tao had told Chen Qian about Chi Xiaocheng being a yandere, so Xiao Wei naturally knew about it too. [[8401 旁白 neutral]]
She just didn't know many of the details. [[8402 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao turned to glance at Chi Xiaocheng. [[8403 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng seemed to be watching them the whole time, and when Su Tao looked over, she gave her a sweet smile. [[8404 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao hesitated for a moment before replying, "That's unavoidable, isn't it? I'm just pretending to like her to keep her emotions stable. We can slowly work on her treatment later." [[8405 苏桃 neutral]]
Chen Qian raised an eyebrow and drew out her words, "Pretending~?" [[8406 陈倩 neutral]]
Su Tao was at a loss for words. "What... what else? You can gossip all you want, but don't spread rumors, okay? If this gets out, it will be bad for Xiaocheng!" [[8407 苏桃 sad]]
Got it. So you don't care if it affects you. [[8408 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Wei and Chen Qian exchanged a look. She secretly made an "OK" gesture. [[8409 旁白 neutral]]
Xiao Wei joined the team. [[8410 旁白 neutral]]
Everything was understood without words. [[8411 旁白 neutral]]
After giving a quick excuse to them, Su Tao pulled Chi Xiaocheng away. [[8412 旁白 neutral]]
"Taotao, what were you guys talking about just now?" [[8413 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng asked curiously. [[8414 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao paused for a step. "It was nothing. Let's go, Dongfang Yang is waiting for us." [[8415 苏桃 neutral]]
They walked into the counseling room, taking a detour to another room. [[8416 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang watched them arrive hand in hand and pointed towards the back. "I've been waiting for you. It's not easy for me to come here personally just to give you a private session." [[8417 东方阳 neutral]]
"Sorry to trouble you. I just don't want to take up too much time." Su Tao's words had a hidden meaning that only they understood; this wasn't an ordinary counseling session. [[8418 苏桃 neutral]]
It was specifically for Chi Xiaocheng! [[8419 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, Dongfang Yang knew a little, but not much. [[8420 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had only told him that Chi Xiaocheng had been emotionally unstable lately and that she was worried there might be a psychological reason. She didn't mention that she was a yandere. [[8421 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen, on the other hand, was mostly aware of the situation due to their frequent discussions. [[8422 旁白 neutral]]
However, this was not good news for Chi Xiaocheng. [[8423 旁白 neutral]]
If she had met with Doctor Lin first, Chi Xiaocheng could have discussed a plan with him. [[8424 旁白 neutral]]
Now, she had no choice but to face it head-on. [[8425 旁白 neutral]]
When they entered the small room, they saw a kind-faced, slightly chubby man wearing glasses. [[8426 旁白 neutral]]
"Hello, my last name is Chen. You can just call me Doctor Chen. Please, have a seat." [[8427 陈医生 neutral]]
Doctor Chen treated her like any other student, showing no sign of anything unusual. [[8428 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Chi Xiaocheng sat down and was thinking about how to use her intermediate acting skills, she heard Doctor Chen say slowly, "Don't be nervous. This is just a routine inquiry as part of the school's plan. Most students' so-called psychological problems are caused by stress and irregular schedules." [[8429 陈医生 neutral]]
"Next, I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer them truthfully." [[8430 陈医生 neutral]]
