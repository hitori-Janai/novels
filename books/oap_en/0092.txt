Chapter 92: The Fake Death Plan [[8028 旁白 neutral]]
"There are actually two ways." [[8029 系统 neutral]]
"The first way is for you, the Host, to just keep going down your current path." [[8030 系统 neutral]]
"As you said, you were just a cannon fodder villain with very little importance in the original story. But because you're the female lead Su Tao's childhood friend, you are a bit more important than the average cannon fodder." [[8031 系统 neutral]]
"Now that your character's importance has increased, you've probably become a minor villain on the same level as the supporting character Chi Song." [[8032 系统 neutral]]
The System's mechanical female voice was very serious. [[8033 旁白 neutral]]
"You need to leave a deeper impression on all the important characters, even become an essential part of their lives. Do your best to become a main character, an inseparable part of this world." [[8034 系统 neutral]]
After hearing this, Chi Xiaocheng's eyes widened. "But the female lead of this world is Taotao. Am I going to take her place?" [[8035 池小橙 sad]]
"You don't have to take the female lead's position. The female lead will still be Su Tao. You just need to take the 'male lead's' position." [[8036 系统 neutral]]
And this did not go against Chi Xiaocheng's goal. [[8037 旁白 neutral]]
She had always wanted all of the female lead Su Tao's love. [[8038 旁白 neutral]]
Only her objective had changed. [[8039 旁白 neutral]]
Instead of relying on Su Tao's female lead aura to protect herself, she would now turn all the male leads into supporting characters. [[8040 旁白 neutral]]
After all, this was a female-oriented novel. [[8041 旁白 neutral]]
Even if a rich female supporting character appeared later, the plot would still revolve around Su Tao. [[8042 旁白 neutral]]
There could be countless stars to accompany it, but there was only one bright moon! [[8043 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng took a breath and asked, "What's the second method?" [[8044 池小橙 neutral]]
"Fake your death." [[8045 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was stunned for a moment. This was a path she had never considered. [[8046 旁白 neutral]]
"Faking your death can't completely free you from the world's correction, but it can reduce the attention and screen time you get. You can hide for a while and use that time to increase your character's importance." [[8047 系统 neutral]]
The System's words opened up a new path for Chi Xiaocheng. [[8048 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't help but mutter to herself, "If I faked my death in front of Taotao, how would she react?" [[8049 池小橙 neutral]]
Her voice wasn't loud, but the empty living room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. [[8050 旁白 neutral]]
Her little follower, Fang Ning, was walking past the sofa behind Chi Xiaocheng, holding a red mop. [[8051 旁白 neutral]]
She heard the unconsciously spoken words. [[8052 旁白 neutral]]
And she froze. [[8053 旁白 neutral]]
She thought she was gradually beginning to understand what a yandere was. [[8054 旁白 neutral]]
But now it seemed... [[8055 旁白 neutral]]
She was so sorry for getting carried away after gaining just a little bit of understanding! [[8056 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't the only one who was stunned; the System was too. [[8057 旁白 neutral]]
"Host, we were discussing how to fake your death to deceive the world, like Hououin Kyouma." [[8058 系统 neutral]]
"I know." [[8059 池小橙 neutral]]
"If you know, then put the female lead Su Tao aside for now!" [[8060 系统 angry]]
"I can't do that." A look of anticipation appeared on Chi Xiaocheng's face. "I suddenly want to see how Taotao would react if I died in front of her." [[8061 池小橙 happy]]
"..." [[8062 系统 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stood up excitedly and walked towards her room, saying in her mind, "System, I always thought you were a useless thing that could only draw cards and make sarcastic comments. I really misunderstood you." [[8063 池小橙 happy]]
The System couldn't help but think of the many skills Chi Xiaocheng had drawn. [[8064 旁白 neutral]]
The silence was deafening. [[8065 旁白 neutral]]
"No need to apologize, Host. Sometimes I think I'm pretty useless myself." [[8066 系统 sad]]
Faking her death in front of Su Tao and avoiding the world's correction were not conflicting goals. [[8067 旁白 neutral]]
The only thing that gave Chi Xiaocheng a headache was that faking a death was very difficult. [[8068 旁白 neutral]]
If she accidentally died for real, it would be a huge loss. [[8069 旁白 neutral]]
"Considering the current plot timeline, I really should be preparing to die." [[8070 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng flipped through the original novel's table of contents. [[8071 旁白 neutral]]
Chapter 150: The Death of Chi Xiaocheng! [[8072 旁白 neutral]]
This title was incredibly eye-catching, always reminding Chi Xiaocheng to act cautiously in this world. [[8073 旁白 neutral]]
According to the timeline, the original owner of her body was already on the verge of death at this point. [[8074 旁白 neutral]]
Her brother was still fighting for the Meng Long Gang in Lizhi City and would hear about his sister's death and come home in two months. [[8075 旁白 neutral]]
"Faking my death right now... I can't do it." [[8076 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed. [[8077 旁白 neutral]]
Even with the System's help, Su Tao's emotions wouldn't explode if she faked her death now. [[8078 旁白 neutral]]
Because their emotional bond wasn't strong enough yet. Su Tao's affection for her was probably just a tiny bit that even she herself didn't realize. [[8079 旁白 neutral]]
"System, let's draw a card." [[8080 池小橙 neutral]]
She had very few Emotion Points left, and now that the pressure was on, Chi Xiaocheng didn't want to wait any longer. [[8081 旁白 neutral]]
She still lacked a sense of security. [[8082 旁白 neutral]]
"Drawing card..." [[8083 系统 neutral]]
"Obtained: Delicate Gummy*1 (Eating it can make your skin smoother)." [[8084 系统 neutral]]
"Obtained: Scar-Removal Pill*1 (Eating it will make scars fade quickly over time)." [[8085 系统 neutral]]
"Obtained: Hen's Eggs*4 (System-produced, perfect for instant noodles, very nutritious)." [[8086 系统 neutral]]
"Obtained: Golden Healing Potion*2 (Drinking it can heal internal injuries)." [[8087 系统 neutral]]
"Congratulations, Host, you have obtained the passive skill: Alertness (Intermediate)." [[8088 系统 happy]]
"Alertness (Intermediate): Host can sense danger to a certain extent in advance." [[8089 系统 neutral]]
"Congratulations, Host, you have obtained the passive skill: Affinity (Intermediate)." [[8090 系统 happy]]
"Affinity (Intermediate): Host's own affinity increases, making it easier for others to like you and for small animals to favor you." [[8091 系统 neutral]]
A ten-card draw yielded two skills and some items. [[8092 旁白 neutral]]
Although they were all passive skills and she didn't get any offensive ones, Chi Xiaocheng was still quite satisfied. [[8093 旁白 happy]]
She had eaten a gummy last time, so eating another one wouldn't do much. She'd give it to Taotao. [[8094 旁白 neutral]]
The scar-removal pill was for Fang Ning. That little one was often bullied and beaten, leaving many scars. [[8095 旁白 neutral]]
The hen's eggs would go with the pickled cabbage beef noodles she drew last time for a doubly nutritious meal to replenish her body. [[8096 旁白 neutral]]
The golden healing potion was for her brother; he was in a gang and could easily get into trouble. [[8097 旁白 neutral]]
After making all the arrangements, Chi Xiaocheng called Fang Ning in after she finished her work outside. [[8098 旁白 neutral]]
First, she gave her the pill, then asked, "Come on, let's continue learning about yandere. I'll show you some examples to help you understand them." [[8099 池小橙 neutral]]
Fang Ning really wanted to say she had already seen an example. [[8100 旁白 neutral]]
But after thinking about it, she didn't say it. [[8101 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng didn't have a computer, so she had Fang Ning use her phone to watch. [[8102 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, she explained the various types of yandere to her. [[8103 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way, Ningning, which school do you go to, and when are you usually free?" [[8104 池小橙 neutral]]
Fang Ning looked at her phone and shook her head. "I don't have money for university." [[8105 方柠 sad]]
"Then where do you usually live?" [[8106 池小橙 neutral]]
"In Liu Guijia's old house." [[8107 方柠 neutral]]
"Hiss..." Chi Xiaocheng sucked in a breath. "This is a bit tricky." [[8108 池小橙 neutral]]
Fang Ning looked up at her, blinking. [[8109 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled, squinting at her. "Ningning, did you know that I like Su Tao? I'm pretending to be a yandere to make her slowly fall in love with me." [[8110 池小橙 neutral]]
"So, I want you to get to know Su Tao too, but I can't be the one to introduce you. It would be great if your lives could overlap a little." [[8111 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stroked her chin thoughtfully. "You can stay here with me for the next two days. I'll ask Dongfang Yang to use his connections to get you a job as a girls' dormitory attendant." [[8112 池小橙 neutral]]
It would be best if it was in the same dormitory building as her and Su Tao. [[8113 旁白 neutral]]
She could eat at the school and have a staff dormitory. This would be the best arrangement for her. [[8114 旁白 neutral]]
Fang Ning listened and pursed her lips. "Then, Xiao... Xiaocheng, is there anything you need me to do? You're so good to me, I'll do anything!" [[8115 方柠 happy]]
She looked up, her eyes shining brightly. [[8116 旁白 neutral]]
Even at this moment, she had a good idea of what Chi Xiaocheng was going to ask her to do. [[8117 旁白 neutral]]
And just as she expected, the brown-haired lolita gave a slightly bewitching smile. [[8118 旁白 neutral]]
"Ningning, I need you to be like me and act like a yandere!" [[8119 池小橙 happy]]
