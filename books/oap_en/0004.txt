Chapter 4: Her Taste [[288 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang noticed that something was wrong with Su Tao's expression. [[289 旁白 neutral]]
His heart tightened. [[290 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at the man in the suit. "What just happened? Tell me!" [[291 叶良 angry]]
The man in the suit shrank back and glanced at Su Tao, who was silent with her lips pressed together. [[292 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, he gritted his teeth and said, "Young Master, when I came in, I saw Miss Su Tao tied to the bed, and then..." [[293 西装男 sad]]
His voice trailed off. "Then, Chi Xiaocheng was on top of Miss Su Tao, and they were ki... kissing..." [[294 西装男 sad]]
Hearing this, Ye Liang's eyes widened in shock. [[295 旁白 neutral]]
The other bodyguards also looked completely shocked. [[296 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone knew how deeply their young master cared for Miss Su Tao. [[297 旁白 neutral]]
How could he say something that would cause trouble like this? [[298 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, is that true?!" [[299 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao glanced away and shook her head gently. "No, she just tied me to the bed and left me here. She warned me... warned me not to get close to you again." [[300 苏桃 sad]]
"Whew, that's a relief." Ye Liang turned to the man in the suit. "How dare you damage Su Tao's reputation? What are you still looking at? Go chase Chi Xiaocheng through the secret door now!" [[301 叶良 angry]]
Hearing this, Su Tao reached out, as if to stop the man in the suit. [[302 旁白 neutral]]
But the words wouldn't come out; she didn't know how to start. [[303 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even know why she wanted to defend Chi Xiaocheng. [[304 旁白 neutral]]
What Chi Xiaocheng had done was clearly terrible. [[305 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao had always wanted to be friends with Chi Xiaocheng again, like they used to be. [[306 旁白 sad]]
But after this, could they really still be friends? [[307 旁白 sad]]
Memories of their past together flooded her mind, and then she imagined Chi Xiaocheng suddenly becoming a yandere. [[308 旁白 sad]]
After more than ten years, how did I never know that Xiaocheng liked me? [[309 苏桃 sad]]
I always just thought of her as a younger sister... [[310 苏桃 sad]]
She composed herself and said to Ye Liang, "Ye Liang, maybe we should... just leave Xiaocheng alone?" [[311 苏桃 sad]]
"You're still defending her?" [[312 叶良 angry]]
"I... She didn't really do anything to me, it's just... it's just..." [[313 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao was stumbling over her words, not knowing how to explain what had just happened. [[314 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang snorted. "I know, she just has a crush on me. But she should look at herself. She's short and unattractive, with more foundation on her face than dirt on the bottom of my shoe. She simply doesn't know what's good for her!" [[315 叶良 angry]]
"There's no way I would ever be interested in her!" [[316 叶良 angry]]
His words were filled with contempt. [[317 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was arrogant and confident. [[318 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao opened her mouth to speak again, but in the end, she didn't defend Chi Xiaocheng. [[319 旁白 neutral]]
She just said weakly, "Xiaocheng... she knows she was wrong. She told me just now that she won't bother you anymore. Can we just... give her one more chance, okay?" [[320 苏桃 sad]]
Seeing the girl he liked with tears in her eyes, Ye Liang's heart softened. [[321 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, whatever you say." [[322 叶良 happy]]
His tone became gentle, and he reached out to pull Su Tao into his arms. [[323 旁白 neutral]]
But to his surprise, Su Tao quickly took a small step back. [[324 旁白 neutral]]
She dodged his embrace. [[325 旁白 neutral]]
He looked a little stunned. [[326 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the complex expression on Su Tao's face, he thought he understood. [[327 旁白 neutral]]
That's right, Su Tao hadn't accepted his advances yet. [[328 叶良 neutral]]
She must want to be alone right now, right? [[329 叶良 neutral]]
Or maybe she's just shy because I came to her rescue in time? [[330 叶良 happy]]
Yes, that must be it! [[331 叶良 happy]]
Ye Liang pushed his hair back and said to Su Tao, "Let's go. We'll go to my private hospital, and I'll have a doctor check on you." [[332 叶良 neutral]]
"Okay." [[333 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao nodded blankly. [[334 旁白 neutral]]
She kept a step away from Ye Liang. [[335 旁白 neutral]]
He became even more sure that Su Tao was just being shy. [[336 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't know that Su Tao was touching a spot inside her mouth where she had been bitten, her mind filled with that small figure. [[337 旁白 neutral]]
She felt confused, but also relieved. [[338 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, after escaping the basement through the secret door, Chi Xiaocheng quickly headed home from memory. [[339 旁白 neutral]]
Her hair was a bit messy, her hands were in her pockets, and her head was lowered to avoid being noticed. [[340 旁白 neutral]]
But her small face was full of anxiety. [[341 旁白 neutral]]
"Damn, I overestimated this body. I only ran for a little while and I already feel dizzy." [[342 池小橙 sad]]
More importantly, the man in the suit was still chasing her. [[343 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, keep going, you're almost home!] [[344 系统 happy]]
"Shut up, you useless System, or at least do something helpful!" [[345 池小橙 angry]]
[20 Emotion Points have been used to temporarily boost the Host's physique. Duration: 3 minutes.] [[346 系统 neutral]]
A warm feeling spread from her stomach to her limbs. Chi Xiaocheng, who was about to collapse, stumbled but steadied herself. [[347 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, she still felt tired and weak. [[348 旁白 neutral]]
She looked back at the man in the suit. [[349 旁白 neutral]]
He was now less than twenty meters away from her. [[350 旁白 neutral]]
"This is not good, he's going to catch me. I need to think of something." [[351 池小橙 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked around. [[352 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, her eyes lit up. [[353 旁白 neutral]]
A tall and strong boy was walking towards her, with the unique look of a naive college student. [[354 旁白 neutral]]
In just a few steps, Chi Xiaocheng's acting skills kicked in. [[355 旁白 neutral]]
She stumbled and fell in front of the boy. [[356 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Kun quickly caught Chi Xiaocheng. It was the first time in his 23 years of being single that he was so close to a girl, and his heart was racing. [[357 旁白 neutral]]
He instinctively looked away. "Are you okay?" [[358 陈坤 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng let out a sob, forcing out tears, and said in a panic, "Please, brother, help me. There's a man in a suit chasing me!" [[359 池小橙 sad]]
"What?!" [[360 陈坤 angry]]
Chen Kun's eyes widened. [[361 旁白 neutral]]
To make the man in the suit seem even worse, Chi Xiaocheng added, "He suddenly grabbed me and tried to kidnap me. I just managed to escape, and now he's chasing me, boohoo..." [[362 池小橙 sad]]
Tears streamed down her face. [[363 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was using the new skill from the System perfectly. [[364 旁白 neutral]]
Now, Chen Kun couldn't just stand by. [[365 旁白 neutral]]
Anger rose in his heart. [[366 旁白 neutral]]
"How can something like this happen in broad daylight!" [[367 陈坤 angry]]
Chen Kun quickly moved Chi Xiaocheng behind him and looked towards the man in the suit. "Is that the guy over there?" [[368 陈坤 angry]]
"Yes, yes!" Chi Xiaocheng nodded hard, then asked innocently, "But big brother, he looks pretty strong. If you can't handle him, maybe we should run?" [[369 池小橙 neutral]]
Could a man admit he couldn't handle something? [[370 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Kun rolled up his sleeves and walked straight towards the man. [[371 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing this, Chi Xiaocheng smirked. [[372 旁白 happy]]
She took the chance to run away, shouting, "Help, I'm being kidnapped!" [[373 池小橙 sad]]
Chen Kun, hearing her, also called out to the passersby, pointing at the man in the suit, "It's him! That guy is a kidnapper!" [[374 陈坤 angry]]
The confused crowd was already suspicious seeing Chi Xiaocheng run away, and his shout made them understand. [[375 旁白 neutral]]
No wonder the little girl was running in such a panic. [[376 旁白 neutral]]
She was being kidnapped! [[377 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, people came from all directions to help, and the man in the suit had no choice but to retreat. [[378 旁白 neutral]]
When he reported back to Ye Liang, he was yelled at again. "Useless! You're 1.8 meters tall and you can't even catch a 1.5-meter-tall girl. What's the point of having you around!" [[379 叶良 angry]]
Su Tao was nearby, and when she heard the man's report, she breathed a sigh of relief. [[380 旁白 happy]]
That's great, Xiaocheng wasn't caught. If Ye Liang, in his anger, had caught her, the consequences would have been unimaginable! [[381 苏桃 happy]]
At that moment, Ye Liang kicked the man in the suit away, glanced at Su Tao beside him, and patted his chest to comfort himself. [[382 旁白 neutral]]
Oh well, at least Su Tao is safe. That's great. [[383 叶良 happy]]
Su Tao had the same thought as Ye Liang. [[384 旁白 neutral]]
Even though her mind was a mess, it was great that Xiaocheng was safe. [[385 苏桃 happy]]
