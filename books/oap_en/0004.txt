第4章 她的味道
Chapter 4: Her Scent
    叶良看出了苏桃脸色的不对劲。
    Ye Liang noticed that something was wrong with Su Tao's expression.
    心中一紧。
    His heart tightened.
    又看向西装男，"刚刚发生了什么，你说！"
    He turned to the man in the suit. "What just happened? Tell me!"
    西装男缩了缩脖子，又看了眼抿嘴不语的苏桃。
    The man in the suit flinched, glancing at Su Tao, who stood silently with her lips pressed together.
    还是一咬牙说道，"少爷，我刚刚进来的时候是看到，苏桃小姐被绑在床上，然后......"
    He finally grit his teeth and said, "Young Master, when I came in, I saw Miss Su Tao tied to the bed, and then..."
    他声音又弱了下来，"然后池小橙骑在苏桃小姐身上，她们两个在亲...亲......"
    His voice trailed off. "...and then Chi Xiaocheng was on top of Miss Su Tao. The two of them were... ki-kissing..."
    叶良闻言，陡然瞪大眼睛。
    Hearing this, Ye Liang's eyes shot wide open.
    其余几个保镖也是一脸震惊。
    The other bodyguards were also completely shocked.
    谁不知道他们少爷对苏桃小姐一片深情。
    Everyone knew how deeply their young master cared for Miss Su Tao.
    这种不利于团结的话能说的？
    How could he say something so disruptive?
    "苏桃，这是真的吗！"
    "Su Tao, is that true?!"
    苏桃眼睛瞥向一边，轻轻摇了摇头，"没有，她只是把我绑在床上，然后晾着我，警告我...警告我不要再接近你了。"
    Su Tao looked away and shook her head gently. "No, she just tied me to the bed and left me there. She warned me... warned me not to get close to you again."
    "呼，那就好。"叶良又看向了西装男，"你个家伙敢损坏苏桃清白，还在这里看什么看，还不顺着暗门去追池小橙！"
    "Whew, that's good then." Ye Liang turned back to the man in the suit. "How dare you damage Su Tao's reputation! What are you still standing here for? Go after Chi Xiaocheng through the secret door!"
    苏桃闻言，伸手又想叫停西装男。
    When Su Tao heard this, she raised a hand, wanting to stop the man.
    可话到嘴边，又不知如何开口。
    But the words wouldn't come out.
    连她自己都不知道，为什么会想帮池小橙辩解。
    Even she didn't know why she wanted to defend Chi Xiaocheng.
    她做的事情，明明很过分。
    What she did was clearly out of line.
    苏桃一直想的，是和池小橙恢复曾经朋友的关系。
    Su Tao had always wanted to go back to being friends with Chi Xiaocheng like before.
    可现在这样了，真的还能当朋友吗？
    But after this, could they really still be friends?
    昔日相处的点点滴滴又涌入脑海，下一秒又幻视到了池小橙刚刚陡然变成病娇的形态。
    Memories of their time together flooded her mind, followed by the image of Chi Xiaocheng's sudden, obsessive transformation just moments ago.
    十几年了，为什么我一点都不知道小橙喜欢我？
    After more than ten years, how did I never know that Xiaocheng liked me?
    明明我只是把她当妹妹……
    I always just thought of her as a little sister...
    她定了定神，对叶良道，"叶良，要不就...就别管小橙了吧？"
    She collected herself and said to Ye Liang, "Ye Liang, maybe we should just... just let Xiaocheng go?"
    "你还在为她说话？"
    "You're still defending her?"
    "我...她也没对我怎么样，只是...只是......"
    "I... she didn't really do anything to me, she just... just..."
    苏桃语无伦次，不知该如何解释刚刚发生的事情。
    Su Tao was struggling to find the right words, unsure how to explain what had just happened.
    Ye Liang哼了一声，"我知道，她不就是喜欢我吗，也不看看自己什么鸟样，长得又矮又挫，脸上的粉底比我鞋底的污渍还要厚，简直是不识好歹！"
    Ye Liang scoffed. "I get it, she has a crush on me, right? Has she even looked at herself? She's short and plain, and the foundation on her face is thicker than the dirt on my shoes. She really doesn't know her place!"
    "我要是能看上她，除非天塌下来！"
    "I'd only be interested in her if the sky came crashing down!"
    言语尽是蔑视。
    His words were full of contempt.
    Ye Liang高傲且自信。
    Ye Liang was arrogant and confident.
    Su Tao又张了张嘴，最终还是没有为池小橙辩解。
    Su Tao opened her mouth again, but in the end, she didn't say anything to defend Chi Xiaocheng.
    只是弱弱地说道，"小橙她其实...知道错了，刚刚和我说以后不会缠着你了，我们就...再给她一次机会，好吗？"
    She only said weakly, "Xiaocheng... she knows she was wrong. She just told me she wouldn't bother you anymore. Can we just... give her one more chance, please?"
    叶良看着喜欢的人儿泪眼婆娑，心不由软了下来。
    Seeing the girl he liked with tears in her eyes, Ye Liang's heart softened.
    "好，都依你。"
    "Alright, whatever you say."
    他语气也很温柔，伸手就想将苏桃揽到怀中。
    His tone became gentle, and he reached out to pull Su Tao into his arms.
    只是让他没想到的是，苏桃竟然迅速后退了半步。
    But to his surprise, Su Tao quickly took a small step back.
    躲开了他的怀抱。
    She had avoided his embrace.
    他眼神有些错愕。
    He looked a little stunned.
    见苏桃脸上的复杂之色，转而又理解了。
    But seeing the complicated look on Su Tao's face, he thought he understood.
    也是，苏桃都没答应自己的追求呢。
    Right, Su Tao hasn't even accepted my pursuit of her yet.
    她现在，一定是想静静吧？
    She must want some quiet time right now, right?
    或者说是因为我英雄救美来得及时，所以害羞了？
    Or maybe she's just shy because I came to her rescue so quickly?
    嗯，一定是这样的！
    Yes, that must be it!
    Ye Liang伸手撩了一下碎发，对苏桃道，"我们先出去吧，去我的私人医院，我让医生帮你看看身体。"
    Ye Liang casually brushed his hair back and said to Su Tao, "Let's get out of here first. We'll go to my private hospital, and I'll have a doctor check on you."
    "嗯。"
    "Okay."
    苏桃呆呆地点头。
    Su Tao nodded blankly.
    始终离叶良有一步的距离。
    She kept a full step's distance from Ye Liang.
    He更加确信，苏桃是害羞了。
    He became even more convinced that Su Tao was just being shy.
    殊不知，苏桃小舌正抵弄着腔内被咬破了的地方，满脑子都是那小小的身影。
    Little did he know, Su Tao was gently probing the cut inside her mouth with her tongue, her mind completely filled with the image of that small figure.
    既迷茫，又庆幸。
    She felt both confused and relieved.
    而池小橙，在通过暗门逃离了地下室后，凭着记忆辨别了一下方向，就迅速往家里跑去。
    Meanwhile, after escaping the basement through the secret door, Chi Xiaocheng quickly figured out her direction from memory and started running home.
    秀发有些散乱，双手放在口袋里，脑袋低得厉害，以免让路人发现不对。
    Her hair was a mess, and she kept her hands in her pockets and her head down low to avoid anyone noticing something was wrong.
    只是那张小脸，满是焦急。
    But her small face was filled with anxiety.
    "该死，还是高估了这具身体，就跑了那么一会儿，竟然感觉头昏脑涨的。"
    "Damn it, I overestimated this body. I've only been running for a little while, and I'm already feeling dizzy."
    更重要的是，身后那个西装男还紧追不舍。
    More importantly, the man in the suit was still chasing her relentlessly.
    [Host, you can do it! You're almost home!]
    "闭嘴啊你个废物系统，或者给我来点作用都行！"
    "Shut up, you useless system! Or at least do something helpful!"
    [20 emotion points have been consumed. Host's physical condition has been temporarily boosted. Duration: 3 minutes.]
    一阵暖流自小腹涌向四肢，差点力竭的池小橙一个踉跄，稳住了身体。
    A warm current flowed from her stomach to her limbs. Chi Xiaocheng, who was about to collapse from exhaustion, stumbled but managed to steady herself.
    可即便如此，依旧又累又虚。
    But even so, she was still tired and weak.
    回头看了眼西装男。
    She glanced back at the man in the suit.
    他此时已经追到了离自己二十米不到的地方。
    He was now less than twenty meters away from her.
    "This is not good, he's going to catch me. I need to think of a plan."
    池小橙左右看了几眼。
    Chi Xiaocheng looked around.
    忽然眼前一亮。
    Suddenly, her eyes lit up.
    迎面走来的是一个高高壮壮的男生，眼神中还透露着大学生特有的愚蠢。
    Walking towards her was a tall, well-built guy, whose eyes held that unique brand of cluelessness special to university students.
    池小橙三步做两步，顿时演技爆发。
    Chi Xiaocheng closed the distance in a few quick steps, her acting skills kicking in instantly.
    一个踉跄，扑倒在了男生面前。
    She stumbled and fell right in front of the guy.
    陈坤眼疾手快，连忙扶住了池小橙，单身23年的他第一次离女孩子这么近，有些心慌。
    Chen Kun reacted quickly and caught Chi Xiaocheng. Having been single for 23 years, this was the closest he had ever been to a girl, and his heart started to race.
    He instinctively looked away. "Are you okay?"
    池小橙一声呜咽，挤出了泪水，慌乱道，"哥哥，哥哥帮我一下，后面有个穿西装的男人一直追着我！"
    Chi Xiaocheng let out a sob, forcing tears from her eyes, and said in a panic, "Big brother, please help me! There's a man in a suit behind me, he's been chasing me!"
    "What?!"
    Chen Kun's eyes widened.
    Afraid the man in the suit didn't seem bad enough, Chi Xiaocheng added more details. "He suddenly grabbed me just now and tried to kidnap me! I barely managed to escape, but he keeps chasing me, boo-hoo-hoo..."
    泪如雨下。
    Tears streamed down her face.
    Chi Xiaocheng had perfectly mastered the new skill the system gave her.
    这下陈坤彻底坐不住了。
    Now, Chen Kun couldn't just stand by.
    Rage welled up inside him.
    "For something like this to happen in broad daylight!"
    陈坤连忙将池小橙护在身后，看向了西装男，"就是那边那个人吗？"
    Chen Kun quickly moved Chi Xiaocheng behind him and looked towards the man in the suit. "Is that him over there?"
    "Mhm!" Chi Xiaocheng nodded eagerly, then added innocently, "But... big brother, he looks pretty strong. If you don't think you can handle it, maybe we should just run?"
    What man would ever admit he couldn't handle it?
    Chen Kun rolled up his sleeves and walked straight towards the man.
    Seeing this, a mischievous smile played on Chi Xiaocheng's lips.
    She took the chance to quickly run away, shouting as she went, "Help! Kidnapping!"
    Chen Kun also rallied the onlookers, pointing at the man in the suit and yelling, "That's him! That guy is a kidnapper!"
    The confused crowd had already been suspicious seeing Chi Xiaocheng running away. His shout made everything clear.
    No wonder the little girl was running in such a panic.
    She was being threatened by a kidnapper!
    Suddenly, people rushed forward from all directions to help. The man in the suit had no choice but to retreat.
    When he returned to report to Ye Liang, he was met with a furious outburst. "Useless! You're 1.8 meters tall and you can't even catch a girl who's 1.5 meters! What's the point of having you around?!"
    Su Tao was standing nearby, and after hearing the man's report, she let out a long sigh of relief.
    That's great, Xiaocheng wasn't caught. If Ye Liang had caught her while he was this angry, the consequences would have been unimaginable!
    Just then, Ye Liang kicked the man in the suit aside, glanced at Su Tao beside him, and patted his chest to reassure himself.
    Whatever, the most important thing is that nothing happened to Su Tao.
    Su Tao was thinking the same thing as Ye Liang.
    Even though her mind was a mess, she was so glad that nothing had happened to Xiaocheng.
