Chapter 136: Oh? What Game Are You Playing? [[11948 旁白 neutral]]
*Ding-ling~* [[11949 旁白 neutral]]
The bell on the door of the snack shop rang as two girls in casual clothes walked out, stretching in unison. [[11950 旁白 neutral]]
"Taozi, you took a few more days off. I feel like that witch Long Mian is getting annoyed with you. Be careful she doesn't make things difficult for you." [[11951 黎染 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed helplessly in response to her part-time colleague's words, "I can't help it. I have something really important to do. I'm even thinking about quitting this part-time job." [[11952 苏桃 sad]]
Her colleague, Li Ran, felt the cold wind and said lightly, "Then just quit. You're only a freshman, so you don't need the social practice credits. You don't earn much from this crappy job, and it's exhausting." [[11953 黎染 neutral]]
The lines were endless whenever students got out of class, especially during the evening shift. [[11954 旁白 neutral]]
Just standing there at the cash register for one night would make her arms and legs feel weak. [[11955 旁白 neutral]]
If she made a mistake and was short by a few dozen yuan, she would have to pay for it herself, which meant she worked the whole day for nothing. [[11956 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao paid for her own tuition. Without this part-time job, it would be really hard to find another one near the school and also close to Chi Xiaocheng's house. [[11957 旁白 neutral]]
It was more like all the good jobs had already been taken. [[11958 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao sighed, "Never mind, I'll think about it some more." [[11959 苏桃 sad]]
"If it really doesn't work out, you can just go to Dongfang Yang's cafe. That Xiaocheng... right, that little Xiaocheng, isn't she there? You two have such a good relationship, and Dongfang Yang is interested in you." [[11960 黎染 neutral]]
Li Ran raised her eyebrows and nudged Su Tao with her shoulder, "If you ask me, Dongfang Yang is much better than that Ye Liang. He's a rich young master who is a bit silly. You might as well just give in to him." [[11961 黎染 neutral]]
Su Tao rolled her eyes at Li Ran helplessly, "Senior, please don't say things like that. I don't have the time. My advisor recently asked me to write two papers for a journal. I'm only a freshman, why do I have to deal with papers already!" [[11962 苏桃 sad]]
"Your advisor is training you. As your senior, let me tell you..." [[11963 黎染 neutral]]
As she was speaking, Su Tao's phone buzzed, interrupting Li Ran. [[11964 旁白 neutral]]
It was the notification sound for a special contact. [[11965 旁白 neutral]]
Li Ran raised her eyebrows, "Who's the special contact?" [[11966 黎染 neutral]]
"It's Xiaocheng." [[11967 苏桃 neutral]]
Afraid she might miss a message from Chi Xiaocheng and cause another accident, Su Tao had set everything related to Chi Xiaocheng as a special contact. [[11968 旁白 neutral]]
Li Ran leaned over to look at the screen and drew out her words meaningfully, "Ooh~ playing a game~" [[11969 黎染 neutral]]
Su Tao's face instantly turned red, "What are you talking about? She was hospitalized after getting injured. I... I was just taking care of her." [[11970 苏桃 sad]]
"Oh, so that's how it is. No wonder you took time off from school and from here to make time for her." [[11971 黎染 neutral]]
Li Ran understood now. [[11972 旁白 neutral]]
No wonder she wasn't moved by Ye Liang, Dongfang Yang, or even that Si Chen. [[11973 旁白 neutral]]
So she had this kind of relationship with that little Xiaocheng. It seemed she should keep her distance from Su Tao, or it would be a big problem if that little Xiaocheng misunderstood. [[11974 旁白 neutral]]
With a look of understanding, Li Ran immediately said she had other things to do and left Su Tao. [[11975 旁白 neutral]]
Watching her senior's retreating back, Su Tao sighed helplessly. [[11976 苏桃 sad]]
It seemed like these kinds of misunderstandings were happening more and more at school. [[11977 旁白 neutral]]
But she couldn't really explain much. Besides a few people she was close to, she never told anyone that Chi Xiaocheng was a yandere. [[11978 旁白 neutral]]
But it was exactly these trivial matters in her life that were constantly bothering her, making her feel frustrated and stressed. [[11979 旁白 sad]]
Walking into an empty, open area, Su Tao suddenly scratched her hair in frustration, "Why do I have to write papers! Ahhh! I have no time and no clue. Maybe I should just write them during these three days at Xiaocheng's house." [[11980 苏桃 angry]]
After saying that, she took out her phone again and saw the "looking forward to your cuteness" sticker Chi Xiaocheng had sent. The motivation she had just gathered deflated. [[11981 旁白 neutral]]
"Forget it. Xiaocheng would probably be unhappy if I did that. I promised to spend time with her, so I should just enjoy it." [[11982 苏桃 sad]]
After all, it was just three days of relaxing at home. [[11983 旁白 neutral]]
It wouldn't be as extreme as last time. [[11984 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao completely relaxed. Compared to all the stress outside, Chi Xiaocheng's place had become a sanctuary for her. [[11985 旁白 neutral]]
Even just lying on that bed, which smelled so much like Xiaocheng, made her unconsciously relax. [[11986 旁白 happy]]
The door opened. [[11987 旁白 neutral]]
A warm breeze greeted her. [[11988 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, the little lolita with long, tea-colored hair had already set the living room's air conditioner to a comfortable temperature. [[11989 旁白 neutral]]
Not only that, but Su Tao also noticed that the original tiled floor of the house had been covered with a thick carpet at some point. [[11990 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was sitting barefoot on the carpet, teasing Da Wang with a cat wand. [[11991 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang was quite proud. It wanted to catch the wand but kept failing, looking so puffed up with anger that it was about to bare its teeth. Its little expression was very cute. [[11992 旁白 happy]]
This warm and healing scene made Su Tao smile involuntarily. [[11993 苏桃 happy]]
She took off her boots. Without even needing to change into slippers, Su Tao stepped onto the soft carpet, "Good afternoon, Xiaocheng." [[11994 苏桃 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng glanced at Su Tao. Her normally round pupils narrowed slightly, looking a bit demonic. [[11995 旁白 neutral]]
It was a sign that she was becoming a bit yandere. [[11996 旁白 neutral]]
Meeting those eyes, Su Tao's relaxed smile vanished, and she inexplicably grew nervous. [[11997 苏桃 sad]]
I haven't done anything, and no one has provoked Xiaocheng. [[11998 旁白 neutral]]
Why... does she seem to be on the verge of turning yandere? [[11999 旁白 sad]]
Just then, Chi Xiaocheng's words reached her ears, "Taotao, the door isn't closed." [[12000 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao came back to her senses and realized she had been so focused on Chi Xiaocheng and Da Wang that she hadn't closed the door after coming in. [[12001 旁白 neutral]]
She turned to close the door, but a sudden gust of wind blew from nowhere. [[12002 旁白 neutral]]
It messed up her hair and also slammed the door shut. [[12003 旁白 neutral]]
With a loud "bang," the door closed tightly. [[12004 旁白 neutral]]
The lighting in the living room wasn't very bright. Chi Xiaocheng was still sitting on the carpet, smiling faintly at her. [[12005 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if nothing had happened. [[12006 旁白 neutral]]
But at the same time, it felt like something terrible had just happened, making Su Tao feel a strange... palpitation in her heart. [[12007 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao calmed herself down, first pressing the switch a couple of times to brighten the living room lights. Only then did she turn to Chi Xiaocheng with a smile, "Xiaocheng, are you hungry? Should I go make dinner?" [[12008 苏桃 neutral]]
"Ah, there's no hurry for dinner." Chi Xiaocheng stood up, holding Da Wang, and held out a hand to her. [[12009 池小橙 neutral]]
"What's wrong?" [[12010 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao looked at the small hand, confused. [[12011 旁白 neutral]]
Does she want to hold hands? [[12012 旁白 neutral]]
She placed her own hand on top of it. [[12013 旁白 neutral]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng shook her head, "Your phone. Starting today, I'll be managing Taotao's phone. You can only use it for half an hour at 10 AM and 10 PM each day." [[12014 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment and asked instinctively, "Why?" [[12015 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng pouted, "You promised to spend these three days only with me, so of course, Taotao can't go looking for other people." [[12016 池小橙 sad]]
After hearing this, Su Tao suddenly looked back at the tightly closed door. [[12017 旁白 neutral]]
It turned out that the moment she walked through the door, [[12018 旁白 neutral]]
the game [[12019 旁白 neutral]]
had already begun. [[12020 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt a little nervous, but the thought that Chi Xiaocheng wasn't completely cutting off her contact with the outside world like last time [[12021 旁白 neutral]]
calmed her down quite a bit. [[12022 旁白 neutral]]
She's just a bit insecure, afraid that I'll chat too much with others and abandon her. [[12023 旁白 neutral]]
She handed her phone to Chi Xiaocheng. For a modern person, her pocket felt strangely empty without the heavy "brick." [[12024 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[12025 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing Chi Xiaocheng's satisfied smile after taking the phone, Su Tao gave in and said, "Alright, Xiaocheng, you've got the phone. What should we do next?" [[12026 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled brightly, "We're not doing anything special. Taotao must be tired from coming over, right? Would you like a cup of black tea?" [[12027 池小橙 happy]]
"After all, Taotao likes it, right?" [[12028 池小橙 happy]]
