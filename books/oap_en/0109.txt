Chapter 109: The Mask of a "Normal Person" [[9486 旁白 neutral]]
Hesitant, yet wanting to get closer. [[9487 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, Su Tao couldn't resist the temptation. [[9488 旁白 neutral]]
She enjoyed the addictive softness. [[9489 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, she even forgot her original reason for doing this. [[9490 旁白 neutral]]
--I'm just pretending to like her. [[9491 苏桃 neutral]]
--This is to soothe her emotions. [[9492 苏桃 neutral]]
--It's a necessary part of the treatment. [[9493 苏桃 neutral]]
Her previous thoughts seemed to fade away without her realizing it. [[9494 旁白 neutral]]
A flash of light flickered from the bar. [[9495 旁白 neutral]]
*Click.* [[9496 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao blushed and didn't dare to look at Chi Xiaocheng. [[9497 旁白 neutral]]
A soft and cute voice sounded by her ear, "Do you like a little kitten like me?" [[9498 池小橙 happy]]
"I li..." [[9499 苏桃 neutral]]
She almost answered instinctively, but she quickly stopped herself after realizing something. [[9500 旁白 neutral]]
The unspoken words turned into a nod. [[9501 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment of tenderness, Chi Xiaocheng let go of Su Tao and looked around. [[9502 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, the dark Xiaocheng didn't appear again. [[9503 池小橙 happy]]
The uneasiness in her heart gradually calmed down. [[9504 旁白 neutral]]
Who said I'm not as good as a kitten? After seeing Tao Tao like this, how could she not like me? [[9505 池小橙 happy]]
So what if I'm pretending to be good? So what if I don't act like a yandere? [[9506 池小橙 happy]]
As long as she slowly comes to like me like this, that's enough. [[9507 池小橙 happy]]
After leaving Su Tao, a few kittens came over. [[9508 旁白 neutral]]
Although they were all cats, you could tell which one was the boss from their behavior. [[9509 旁白 neutral]]
A slightly chubby, brown tabby cat with its head held high walked elegantly to Chi Xiaocheng, waiting for her to scratch its chin. [[9510 旁白 neutral]]
When Chi Xiaocheng reached out her hand, the tabby cat closed its eyes in comfort. [[9511 旁白 neutral]]
It even patted Chi Xiaocheng's hand with its little paw. [[9512 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed to be a reward for her. [[9513 旁白 neutral]]
Xu Ran walked over and looked at Chi Xiaocheng in amazement, "This is the first time Da Wang has been so friendly with someone." [[9514 徐然 happy]]
"Da Wang?" [[9515 池小橙 neutral]]
"That's the tabby's name." Xu Ran wiggled her fingers at the cat, but even for her, the cat's owner, it didn't give her a friendly look. [[9516 徐然 neutral]]
Instead, it was enjoying Chi Xiaocheng's petting. [[9517 旁白 neutral]]
"She does have a bit of a temper." Chi Xiaocheng's intermediate-level affinity was very effective on small animals. [[9518 池小橙 neutral]]
The other cats looked like they couldn't wait to climb into Chi Xiaocheng's arms. [[9519 旁白 neutral]]
Xu Ran asked, "How about it, do you want to take him home?" [[9520 徐然 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng first glanced at Su Tao, then at the tabby cat. [[9521 旁白 neutral]]
The proud cat named Da Wang seemed to understand their conversation, holding out a paw as a reward, waiting for Chi Xiaocheng to take it. [[9522 旁白 neutral]]
She looked at Xu Ran and asked, "Is that really okay?" [[9523 池小橙 neutral]]
Xu Ran smiled, "We get a new batch of cats here regularly, and it's hard to care for too many. I can see you both really like cats and won't mistreat them, so it's fine." [[9524 徐然 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng looked at Su Tao and asked, "What do you think, Tao Tao?" [[9525 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao only came back to her senses when she heard Chi Xiaocheng's words, "I... I'm fine with anything." [[9526 苏桃 neutral]]
It seemed she was still thinking about the sweet moment from before. [[9527 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled and gently took the tabby's paw, "Alright then, thank you, miss." [[9528 池小橙 happy]]
"It's nothing." Xu Ran smiled mysteriously, "For girls, having a cat can help your relationship grow~" [[9529 徐然 happy]]
After speaking, she stood up and walked towards Su Tao. [[9530 旁白 neutral]]
She took a photo out from her pocket. [[9531 旁白 neutral]]
"This is for you." [[9532 徐然 neutral]]
She handed the photo to Su Tao. [[9533 旁白 neutral]]
It instantly made the young woman blush. [[9534 旁白 neutral]]
The photo was of the scene from just now. [[9535 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was sitting on her lap, and they were lost in each other's gentle affection. The angle and lighting were perfect. [[9536 旁白 neutral]]
Xu Ran had a knowing smile and said softly, "The little one is very cute. Many people will probably want her, so you should keep a close watch." [[9537 徐然 happy]]
Su Tao glanced at Chi Xiaocheng holding Da Wang and nervously took the photo, "Th... thank you." [[9538 苏桃 neutral]]
Xu Ran said, "Do you want the digital copy? It would make a great wallpaper." [[9539 徐然 neutral]]
"Wallpaper..." [[9540 苏桃 neutral]]
If this was my phone wallpaper, I'd die of embarrassment if someone saw it, right? [[9541 苏桃 neutral]]
It was just too embarrassing. [[9542 旁白 neutral]]
Xu Ran deliberately stood up and walked away, "If you don't want it, I'll delete it." [[9543 徐然 happy]]
"Don't..." [[9544 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao reached out and grabbed the corner of Xu Ran's clothes, whispering, "You... you can add me on WeChat and send it to me." [[9545 苏桃 neutral]]
"OK~" [[9546 徐然 happy]]
After getting the photo, they completed the adoption paperwork for Da Wang. They were also given a pile of cat litter, cat treats, a teaser wand, and many other things. [[9547 旁白 neutral]]
Never mind a girl, even a grown man would probably struggle to carry it all. [[9548 旁白 neutral]]
This made Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng give Dongfang Yang another "good guy card." [[9549 旁白 neutral]]
Not only was the cat free, but the supplies they gave were worth one or two thousand. [[9550 旁白 neutral]]
Even though there was a lot of stuff, Su Tao was stronger than the average man. [[9551 旁白 neutral]]
She had Chi Xiaocheng hold Da Wang while she easily lifted the pile of things, canceling their plan to go to the mall and heading home instead. [[9552 旁白 neutral]]
But as soon as they entered a busy area, Chi Xiaocheng's alertness skill gave a faint warning. [[9553 旁白 neutral]]
She looked around but didn't see the dark Xiaocheng in any corner. [[9554 旁白 neutral]]
They made it all the way home without any trouble. [[9555 旁白 neutral]]
They set up the cat's bed and put everything away. [[9556 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because of Chi Xiaocheng's affinity skill, Da Wang adjusted to the new environment quickly and soon became familiar with the house. [[9557 旁白 neutral]]
But he did have a bit of a temper. Even if Chi Xiaocheng wanted to hold him, he wouldn't always let her. [[9558 旁白 neutral]]
In the evening, as the day was ending, Su Tao decided to leave after dinner. "Xiaocheng, I have something to do, so I'll be going now." [[9559 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was a little reluctant, "Aren't you sleeping here tonight, Tao Tao?" [[9560 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao comforted her, "I have the night shift for my part-time job, and I also need to get a leave request form from my counselor tonight. I'll come back tomorrow, okay?" [[9561 苏桃 neutral]]
She paused, then reached out and stroked Chi Xiaocheng's hair, "Be good. I'll come over and make you breakfast tomorrow. You've been walking around all day, and your body gets tired easily. Take a shower and go to bed early tonight." [[9562 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay." [[9563 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng nodded lightly when she heard Su Tao say "be good." [[9564 旁白 neutral]]
She could have acted like a yandere to make Su Tao stay, and even keep her here for the next few days. [[9565 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't. [[9566 旁白 neutral]]
If she forced her, Tao Tao would surely be unhappy. [[9567 旁白 neutral]]
Just like she said. [[9568 旁白 neutral]]
As long as she was well-behaved, she would always like her and stay by her side. [[9569 旁白 neutral]]
After Su Tao left, Chi Xiaocheng sat on the sofa with Da Wang lying on her lap, enjoying being petted. [[9570 旁白 neutral]]
Beside her, the dark Xiaocheng appeared again. [[9571 旁白 neutral]]
She always appeared when Chi Xiaocheng was calm or feeling down, like a mirror or a friend, sitting beside her. [[9572 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng waited for a long time, but the dark Xiaocheng didn't say anything to tempt her. [[9573 旁白 neutral]]
She frowned and asked first, "Aren't you going to say something like before?" [[9574 池小橙 angry]]
The dark Xiaocheng smoothed the wrinkles on her dress and said flatly, "I just came to keep a lonely you company." [[9575 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng gave a cold smile, "You know you can't persuade me. Tao Tao really liked me today, and I will continue to believe in her." [[9576 池小橙 happy]]
"Don't be so tense." the dark Xiaocheng said lightly, "You and I are one. Su Tao won't be lonely without you." [[9577 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"She has people pursuing her, close friends she can confide in, a mentor who cares about her, and colleagues who help and understand her. She has never lacked for anything." [[9578 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"But what about you?" [[9579 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"If it weren't for this new kitten, once Su Tao leaves, you'd only have loneliness for company." [[9580 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
"You can only pathetically beg for Su Tao not to leave." [[9581 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
She bent down and quietly looked at Chi Xiaocheng's face, "In your past life, you believed your ex-girlfriend just like this, right? And what was the result?" [[9582 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
Her calm heart was once again stirred with anxiety. [[9583 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng snorted, "You still want me to wear the yandere mask. I won't be tempted by you!" [[9584 池小橙 angry]]
The deeper the trust, the deeper the hurt. [[9585 旁白 sad]]
Haven't you had enough of a lesson so painful that you chose to forget it? [[9586 旁白 sad]]
The dark Xiaocheng gave a meaningful smile, "So, is the 'yandere' the mask, or is the current 'you' the mask?" [[9587 漆黑小橙 neutral]]
