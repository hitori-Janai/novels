Chapter 199: A New, Powerful Skill [[17425 旁白 neutral]]
Although he didn't believe in ghosts, the strange scarecrow made him break out in a cold sweat. [[17426 旁白 neutral]]
He could feel the shirt under his suit was soaked through. [[17427 旁白 neutral]]
And that little girl in the hood who flashed by just now—was it an illusion or something else? [[17428 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, Su Tao's concerned voice came from the side, "Divine Doctor Chu, are you alright?" [[17429 苏桃 neutral]]
Facing a murderous intent and a threat to his own survival, Chu Lingfeng finally shifted his focus away from Su Tao. [[17430 旁白 neutral]]
He swallowed and said to Su Tao, "Miss Su, I'll talk to you later. I have something more important to deal with right now." [[17431 楚凌风 neutral]]
As soon as he finished speaking, that faint killing intent appeared again. [[17432 旁白 neutral]]
He looked back at the window. [[17433 旁白 neutral]]
The scarecrow that had been sitting there was gone. [[17434 旁白 neutral]]
He could still hear a faint voice in his ear, like an illusion. [[17435 旁白 neutral]]
"Are you looking for me?" [[17436 池小橙 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng took a deep breath, trying to calm himself, and placed his right hand on his left wrist to check his own pulse. [[17437 旁白 neutral]]
"My body is fine..." [[17438 楚凌风 neutral]]
He muttered, his eyes hardening. "I'd like to see who's behind all this supernatural nonsense!" [[17439 楚凌风 angry]]
After handing things over to Si Chen's younger brother, Si Lai, he went to find the head of security by himself. [[17440 旁白 neutral]]
After he explained the situation, the security head looked at him strangely. "Divine Doctor Chu, how can there be ghosts in this world? The birthday banquet is about to start, and you're causing trouble now..." [[17441 保安队长 neutral]]
"It's precisely because the banquet is about to start that we need to avoid any risks beforehand!" Chu Lingfeng snorted, "Just do as I say. If you talk back again, you can get lost!" [[17442 楚凌风 angry]]
At these words, the security head's face turned pale. [[17443 旁白 neutral]]
He clenched his fists. [[17444 旁白 neutral]]
But thinking of Chu Lingfeng's status in the Si family, he suppressed his anger and turned to call his subordinates. [[17445 旁白 neutral]]
With two people now frantically shouting about a ghost, even the guests who didn't believe in such things started to panic. [[17446 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen, having just finished discussing family matters, approached Su Tao. "What's going on? Why is everyone talking about a ghost?" [[17447 司辰 neutral]]
"I'm not sure either." Su Tao smoothed her hair and said to Si Chen, "Before the banquet starts, could you help me find that scarecrow doll? I don't know when I dropped it, and now I can't find it. It's strange..." [[17448 苏桃 neutral]]
Si Chen watched Su Tao as she looked down, searching, and a silence fell over his heart. [[17449 旁白 neutral]]
Did she really drop that thing by accident? [[17450 旁白 neutral]]
The last time he used the 'startup password,' he had spent the next few days sitting shirtless in the hospital. [[17451 旁白 neutral]]
Just waiting for Chi Xiaocheng to wake up. [[17452 旁白 neutral]]
But for several days after her electrocardiogram blipped once, she had shown no signs of movement. [[17453 旁白 neutral]]
He hadn't believed in ghosts. [[17454 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[17455 旁白 neutral]]
"Hiss... this air conditioning isn't very good, it feels a bit cold." [[17456 宾客1 neutral]]
A small panic spread through the venue, while Chi Xiaocheng, hiding in the shadows, was smiling with delight. [[17457 旁白 happy]]
"System, this new skill you gave me is really useful!" [[17458 池小橙 happy]]
[Host, you won it in the lottery yourself. It has nothing to do with me.] [[17459 系统 neutral]]
"Although I got a lot of junk, this skill alone was worth it." [[17460 池小橙 happy]]
She had been in this corner by the door the whole time and hadn't moved. Everything Chu Lingfeng saw was, of course, an illusion. [[17461 旁白 neutral]]
The new character was certainly living up to his role. [[17462 旁白 neutral]]
He was providing Emotion Points so quickly in the early stages. [[17463 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng hadn't even revealed herself and had only used the scarecrow to frighten him, yet he had already provided nearly 200 Emotion Points. [[17464 旁白 neutral]]
Adding the 700 Emotion Points she had saved up, plus the points generated from various characters missing and caring for her during this time. [[17465 旁白 neutral]]
She had just saved up a thousand points. [[17466 旁白 neutral]]
So she decisively did a ten-pull lottery. [[17467 旁白 neutral]]
Nine of them were useless fodder. [[17468 旁白 neutral]]
The guaranteed skill from the pity system was the main event! [[17469 旁白 happy]]
[Illusion Control (Low-Level): The host can bind to a person and create various illusions to affect the target. Each independent illusion can last for no more than 5 seconds. The illusions are limited to sight, hearing, and smell.] [[17470 系统 neutral]]
[The skill will continuously consume Emotion Points while active.] [[17471 系统 neutral]]
The only unfortunate thing was that this was a low-level skill. [[17472 旁白 neutral]]
If it were an intermediate or even an advanced skill, it would be much more versatile! [[17473 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng was already very satisfied. After all, she could use such illusions on Tao Tao, too. [[17474 池小橙 happy]]
Unfortunately, the Emotion Point consumption seemed a bit high, making it difficult to use this skill to farm points from one person. [[17475 旁白 sad]]
Scaring Chu Lingfeng was currently profitable because he was a new character. [[17476 旁白 neutral]]
If she used this skill to scare Su Tao, it would be a guaranteed loss. [[17477 旁白 neutral]]
I'll use it to scare Si Chen next time. [[17478 池小橙 neutral]]
That rational guy is too calm; he has always provided fewer Emotion Points. [[17479 旁白 neutral]]
Because of this, Chu Lingfeng was like a headless fly, afraid of the giant human hand but only able to run around everywhere. [[17480 旁白 neutral]]
But now, with more security guards searching for her, it was getting a bit dangerous. [[17481 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng shifted her position. Another guard walked past the door, and she felt a little more anxious. [[17482 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze once again fell on Chu Lingfeng in the crowd not far away. [[17483 旁白 neutral]]
Dealing with this guy was the priority; otherwise, she would be found sooner or later. [[17484 旁白 neutral]]
But what made Chi Xiaocheng hesitate was that she didn't know the strength of this divine doctor male lead. [[17485 旁白 neutral]]
That "Taiyi Thirteen Needles" sounded a bit too impressive. What if she revealed herself, her blackening skill failed again, and she couldn't beat him? [[17486 旁白 neutral]]
As her thoughts ran wild, a sharp gaze suddenly shot over! [[17487 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng had sensed her stare and turned to look in her direction. [[17488 旁白 neutral]]
The small, dark corner by the door should have been unnoticeable. [[17489 旁白 neutral]]
But Chi Xiaocheng's faint, red-glowing eyes were somewhat obvious in the darkness. [[17490 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng snorted, "So you're here. I'd like to see who is controlling this doll!" [[17491 楚凌风 angry]]
He squeezed through the crowd and strode towards Chi Xiaocheng. [[17492 旁白 neutral]]
I've been spotted! [[17493 池小橙 sad]]
The thought rose in Chi Xiaocheng's mind, and she quickly unbound the illusion skill from Chu Lingfeng. [[17494 旁白 neutral]]
And then bound it to herself. [[17495 旁白 neutral]]
She created an illusion on herself that was identical to the floor and walls. [[17496 旁白 neutral]]
Instantly, she seemed to blend into the environment, looking as if she had vanished on the spot. [[17497 旁白 neutral]]
Chu Lingfeng froze for a moment, then rubbed his eyes. [[17498 旁白 neutral]]
Then he saw that the scarecrow had slipped out the door. [[17499 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't run!" [[17500 楚凌风 angry]]
He shouted, startling the other people as he quickly gave chase. [[17501 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't be at ease until that faint sense of danger was gone. [[17502 旁白 neutral]]
He had to catch the culprit behind this prank! [[17503 旁白 neutral]]
He ran straight out the door and saw the scarecrow on top of a bush, stumbling towards the garden outside the villa. [[17504 旁白 neutral]]
Her small body was no match for an adult's legs. [[17505 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, Chu Lingfeng was even more convinced that someone was controlling the scarecrow from behind! [[17506 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps there was a thin string attached, trying to lure him over. [[17507 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[17508 旁白 neutral]]
That was just what he wanted! [[17509 旁白 happy]]
He wasn't some weakling who would fall over at the slightest touch. [[17510 旁白 neutral]]
Since you want to lure me over, I'll see who you really are! [[17511 旁白 neutral]]
He slowed his pace, continuing to chase the scarecrow. [[17512 旁白 neutral]]
Then, he arrived at a pavilion in the backyard of the villa estate. [[17513 旁白 neutral]]
The scarecrow, whether tired or for some other reason, finally stopped. [[17514 旁白 neutral]]
