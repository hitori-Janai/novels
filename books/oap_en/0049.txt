Chapter 49 I'm Playing a Yandere, Not a Madman [[4241 旁白 neutral]]
Don't hesitate. [[4242 旁白 neutral]]
Don't feel pity. [[4243 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao tightly gripped the teacup she was holding, feeling her heart race. [[4244 旁白 neutral]]
In the reflection of her pupils, Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head and smiled sweetly, "Tao Tao, what's wrong?" [[4245 池小橙 neutral]]
Strands of hair fell from beside her ear, swaying in the air. [[4246 旁白 neutral]]
Her smile was cute and happy. [[4247 旁白 neutral]]
But who knew if this side was just a facade? [[4248 旁白 neutral]]
Since she had decided, she would do it! [[4249 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly chugged the black tea in her hand. [[4250 旁白 neutral]]
A warm current surged through her body. She used it to muster her courage, and her eyes suddenly became firm. [[4251 旁白 neutral]]
She said very seriously to Chi Xiaocheng, "Xiaocheng, tonight, I'm going to be Ye Liang's maid!" [[4252 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's mouth slightly opened. The coconut juice was still in her hand. This wasn't the first time she heard this news, but coming from Su Tao's mouth, it seemed to have a different flavor. [[4253 旁白 neutral]]
Her pink lips, lacking moisture, began to dry and stiffen. The highlights in her eyes seemed to be gradually diminishing. [[4254 旁白 neutral]]
"Why?" [[4255 池小橙 neutral]]
The indifferent voice betrayed no emotion. [[4256 旁白 neutral]]
Because the last banquet caused him a lot of trouble, and as an ordinary person, she had no money or connections, so she could only compensate him in the way he expected. [[4257 旁白 neutral]]
This was the fundamental reason, but Su Tao knew she couldn't say that. [[4258 旁白 neutral]]
Saying that would be like explaining, and she would have to keep explaining under his constant questioning. [[4259 旁白 neutral]]
She had to make a definitive statement! [[4260 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao took a deep breath, "Because I like... because I also have a good impression of Ye Liang, and I don't dislike this matter, so I agreed!" [[4261 苏桃 neutral]]
She ultimately didn't say the word "like." [[4262 旁白 neutral]]
Whether it was deception or genuine feeling, she couldn't really say she liked Ye Liang. [[4263 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she said, there was a hint of fondness and longing for the opposite sex. [[4264 旁白 neutral]]
"So, Xiaocheng, I'm sorry I can't accompany you for the next few days." [[4265 苏桃 neutral]]
After Su Tao finished speaking, it felt as if a heavy stone had fallen from her heart, and she felt much lighter. [[4266 旁白 neutral]]
Don't provoke her too much—according to Doctor Cheng, this should be fine, right? [[4267 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she finished speaking, her hand was suddenly grabbed by Chi Xiaocheng. [[4268 旁白 neutral]]
A hint of pain came, making Su Tao secretly alarmed. [[4269 旁白 neutral]]
When did Xiaocheng's strength become so great? [[4270 旁白 neutral]]
Looking up, she noticed that Chi Xiaocheng's state was very wrong at this moment. [[4271 旁白 neutral]]
Her breathing was rapid, her shoulders trembling, like a drowning person grasping at the last straw, "But didn't we agree to be together forever?" [[4272 池小橙 sad]]
"Why are you still going to Ye Liang?" [[4273 池小橙 sad]]
"Sorry, Xiaocheng." Su Tao threw off Chi Xiaocheng's arm. [[4274 苏桃 neutral]]
Then she stood up. She wanted to observe Chi Xiaocheng's reaction further. Her current reaction was still within expectations. [[4275 旁白 neutral]]
"No, you can't~" [[4276 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice, as faint as a mosquito, caught Su Tao's attention. [[4277 旁白 neutral]]
She thought Chi Xiaocheng would get up and stop her, but she didn't expect Chi Xiaocheng to just sit on the sofa, still holding the glass of coconut juice. [[4278 旁白 neutral]]
Her smile was incredibly complex, "Tao Tao, you can't go to Ye Liang's place~" [[4279 池小橙 neutral]]
"He will hurt you, he will abandon you, he will play with your feelings. In this world, only I truly like you wholeheartedly." [[4280 池小橙 neutral]]
"So... you can't go~" [[4281 池小橙 neutral]]
After saying that, she gave her a sweet smile. [[4282 旁白 neutral]]
But this sweetness seemed to be laced with poison. [[4283 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao frowned and took a step to leave, but as soon as she extended one foot, a sudden weakness spread through her body. [[4284 旁白 neutral]]
She quickly covered her head, propping herself up on the armrest of the sofa, "W-what's going on?" [[4285 苏桃 sad]]
"Hehe, this is sleeping tea~" [[4286 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng put down the orange juice in her hand and happily opened her arms, waiting for her. [[4287 旁白 neutral]]
Her head began to feel dizzy, her limbs gradually weakened, and a heavy drowsiness made Su Tao unable to hold on any longer. [[4288 旁白 neutral]]
From the corner of her eye, she saw the glass of plain water that Chi Xiaocheng hadn't touched. [[4289 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiao..." [[4290 苏桃 sad]]
Before the word "cheng" could be uttered, her entire body fell towards Chi Xiaocheng. [[4291 旁白 neutral]]
With a faint fragrance, the girl fell into her embrace. [[4292 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng buried her nose in Su Tao's hair and took a light sniff. [[4293 旁白 neutral]]
She brought her small mouth close to Su Tao's earlobe and slowly said, in Su Tao's remaining consciousness, "Tao Tao, you can't leave me~" [[4294 池小橙 neutral]]
"You're too tired. Get a good rest with 6 hours of deep sleep." [[4295 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng gently placed Su Tao on the sofa, and snorted with a sinister look in her eyes, "Tao Tao, Tao Tao, since you already know I'm a yandere, why are you still testing me? Don't you know yanderes can't be tested?" [[4296 池小橙 angry]]
Testing means death. Is this a joke that can be made? [[4297 旁白 neutral]]
She stood up and stretched, "It's only because I'm a fake yandere. If I were a real yandere, Tao Tao, you would have been in trouble long ago. And that Ye Liang too, although he's a young master, a real yandere would have directly dragged him down with her." [[4298 池小橙 neutral]]
[So, Host, what's next? Are you going to hold her captive?] [[4299 系统 neutral]]
"Of course I wouldn't do such a thing. It's just that Tao Tao is too tired, so I'm letting her get some good sleep. We don't do anything illegal." [[4300 池小橙 neutral]]
"We've eliminated the estrangement between sisters and repaired our relationship. Su Tao took leave specifically to stay at my house for three days to take care of my illness. Isn't this part of daily life? System, don't make it sound so bad." [[4301 池小橙 neutral]]
"I'm doing this for Tao Tao's own good." [[4302 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng said, her eyes gradually turning cold, "She can't go to Ye Liang's place. Even if this plot isn't in the original novel, I know what will happen next." [[4303 池小橙 neutral]]
Three days as a personal maid, living in his house, with some unexpected events at night, and then some sparks flying. Thinking about it with the melodramatic mindset of a female-oriented novel, these might even be considered mild. [[4304 旁白 neutral]]
No one can touch my Su Tao! [[4305 池小橙 angry]]
"All of this is to prevent her from having a tragic ending like in the original plot." [[4306 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sighed, picked up Su Tao with difficulty, and slowly carried her to her room. [[4307 旁白 neutral]]
She placed her on the bed, covered her with the blanket, her movements incredibly gentle, "At least 6 hours. Get a good rest~" [[4308 池小橙 neutral]]
At this moment, the system in her mind spoke. [[4309 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, don't you think this is a good opportunity?] [[4310 系统 neutral]]
"What good opportunity?" [[4311 池小橙 neutral]]
[We're villains. Now the female lead Su Tao is powerless. You know~] [[4312 系统 neutral]]
"What, now you remember you're a villain system?" Chi Xiaocheng rolled her eyes. After spending these past few days together, because of Su Tao's beauty and pure personality, plus the delicate care she received in the hospital for a few days. [[4313 池小橙 neutral]]
It was true that she somewhat liked this female lead from the novel. [[4314 旁白 neutral]]
But she disdained doing such things. [[4315 旁白 neutral]]
This would be a defilement of Su Tao! [[4316 旁白 neutral]]
She was playing a yandere, not a madman. [[4317 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng sat on the edge of the bed, reaching out to tidy Su Tao's disheveled hair, and said to the system, "Su Tao has a heart problem. She's avoiding and afraid of the fact that I'm a yandere. Now she can't even look at me directly, so how can she fall in love with me?" [[4318 池小橙 neutral]]
"The reason I hold such importance in her heart is because the original owner had a very good relationship with her, and they relied on each other since childhood, making her unwilling to easily abandon the original owner. It's this emotion that restrains her." [[4319 池小橙 neutral]]
"In terms of romantic affection, Ye Liang and Dongfang Yang probably rank higher than me in her heart." [[4320 池小橙 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng knew very well that if Su Tao didn't change her attitude towards her, then even if she continued to be sick, she wouldn't like her. [[4321 旁白 neutral]]
She would only constantly seek methods of treatment, agree with her, and reminisce about past beautiful memories. [[4322 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of returning to the intimate sisterly relationship they had as children. [[4323 旁白 neutral]]
That won't do. You should fall completely in love with me! [[4324 池小橙 neutral]]
No, not should, but must! [[4325 池小橙 neutral]]
