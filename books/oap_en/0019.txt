Chapter 19: Is This a Gift? [[1670 旁白 neutral]]
The wind howled and rain poured, with lightning and thunder. [[1671 旁白 neutral]]
The rain had been falling for nearly an hour with no signs of letting up. [[1672 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, it seemed to be getting stronger. [[1673 旁白 neutral]]
On the dormitory rooftop, Chi Xiaocheng was still sitting under the rain shelter, breathing weakly with a pale face. [[1674 旁白 neutral]]
She had turned off the continuous notification sounds for Emotion Points in her mind because they were too noisy, leaving only the sound of thunder and rain. [[1675 旁白 neutral]]
But the wind was so strong that even under the shelter, droplets of water were blown onto her, soaking half of her body. Her thin T-shirt clung to her, revealing glimpses of her fair skin. [[1676 旁白 neutral]]
"System, how long has it been?" [[1677 池小橙 neutral]]
To make her act more convincing, she had thrown her phone from the 14th floor and had no idea how much time had passed since she hung up. [[1678 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, she still had the System. [[1679 旁白 neutral]]
[About 20 minutes have passed.] [[1680 系统 neutral]]
"By my calculations, Su Tao should be back at school by now." [[1681 池小橙 neutral]]
She moved her body out into the open, letting the rain soak her. [[1682 旁白 neutral]]
It was late autumn in November, and the temperature was not warm. [[1683 旁白 neutral]]
The rain was freezing, and Chi Xiaocheng shivered uncontrollably. [[1684 旁白 neutral]]
Even the System felt a bit sorry for her. [[1685 旁白 neutral]]
[Host, maybe we should just forget it. Or how about we use some Emotion Points to buy something? I'm scared when you're like this.] [[1686 系统 sad]]
"I haven't even said much, what's a system like you afraid of?" [[1687 池小橙 angry]]
[If you die, I'll be gone too! Besides, Host, are you sure you're not a yandere? Your actions are scaring me.] [[1688 系统 sad]]
"Aren't you a villain system? You should be cheering even if I went to kill someone. I haven't done anything yet and you're already scared. You're so useless, aren't you?" [[1689 池小橙 angry]]
[QAQ] [[1690 系统 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng rolled her eyes. After making sure she was completely soaked, she huddled back under the rain shelter, curling up to preserve her last bit of warmth. [[1691 旁白 neutral]]
She had already completed the second step of her plan, using Emotion Points to buy and eat an energy pill. [[1692 旁白 neutral]]
But the weakness of this body was beyond Chi Xiaocheng's expectations; she still felt very weak even after taking the pill. [[1693 旁白 neutral]]
Her head ached, felt heavy, and she desperately wanted to sleep. [[1694 旁白 neutral]]
But the female lead hadn't arrived yet, and the third step of her plan was the most crucial. [[1695 旁白 neutral]]
Afraid she would pass out from weakness, she forced herself to talk to the System again. "To answer your question from before, I told you I'm playing a yandere character. If I'm going to act, I have to go all the way. Otherwise, how will I make the female lead fall for it?" [[1696 池小橙 neutral]]
"Besides, a real yandere wouldn't be as self-aware as I am. They don't even know they're a yandere, okay?" [[1697 池小橙 neutral]]
"And think about that look Ye Liang gave me this afternoon, plus the hundreds of Emotion Points I just got. I feel like he wants to bury me alive right now. I have to get more Emotion Points and keep the female lead on my side." [[1698 池小橙 neutral]]
Without the protection of the female lead's halo, Chi Xiaocheng was truly afraid something would happen to her! [[1699 旁白 neutral]]
Her conversation turned into a monologue. [[1700 旁白 neutral]]
After an unknown amount of time, the rooftop door was thrown open with a "bang." [[1701 旁白 neutral]]
An anxious voice called out, "Xiaocheng!" [[1702 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao was here! [[1703 旁白 neutral]]
She panted, leaning against the wall to keep from collapsing from her weak legs. [[1704 旁白 neutral]]
After cycling for half an hour in the storm and flooded roads, she had to climb 14 floors because of a power outage, desperately hoping to see Chi Xiaocheng in the stairwell. [[1705 旁白 neutral]]
The iron door slammed in the wind, and her dress was completely soaked, clinging to her skin with water droplets. Every step was exhausting. [[1706 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, she stepped outside and shouted against the wind, "Xiaocheng, where are you!" [[1707 苏桃 sad]]
There was no answer from the rooftop, and she couldn't see Chi Xiaocheng. [[1708 旁白 neutral]]
But when she was downstairs, she hadn't seen any "body" or ambulance. [[1709 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng must still be okay! [[1710 旁白 happy]]
She believed it with all her heart. [[1711 旁白 neutral]]
Just as she was about to search the rooftop, Su Tao suddenly heard a weak but happy voice, "Taotao, are you back?" [[1712 池小橙 happy]]
"Xiaocheng?!" [[1713 苏桃 happy]]
Following the voice, Su Tao was overjoyed to find Chi Xiaocheng hiding under the rain shelter. [[1714 旁白 happy]]
Her tense body suddenly relaxed. Her legs gave way, and Su Tao fell onto Chi Xiaocheng, hugging her tightly, her voice choked with tears, "Xiaocheng, I'm so glad you're okay!" [[1715 苏桃 sad]]
Tears mixed with raindrops streamed down her face. [[1716 旁白 neutral]]
Leaning on her shoulder, Chi Xiaocheng felt the warmth of the embrace, a slight smile playing on her lips. [[1717 旁白 neutral]]
Ah~ This feeling of being loved with all one's heart is so warm. [[1718 旁白 happy]]
That was what she felt inside, but her acting was still on point. [[1719 旁白 neutral]]
Worry and fear flowed towards Su Tao along with her weak sobs, "I... I'm sorry, Taotao. The 14th... 14th floor was too high... I didn't dare to jump. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." [[1720 池小橙 sad]]
Hearing this, Su Tao's heart ached. [[1721 旁白 sad]]
She knew Chi Xiaocheng had misunderstood her. [[1722 旁白 neutral]]
But she didn't blame her. She felt more self-reproach, because she hadn't been clear and almost got Xiaocheng killed. [[1723 旁白 sad]]
Filled with guilt, Su Tao took a deep breath, cupped Chi Xiaocheng's face, and gently wiped away her tears with her thumb, saying, [[1724 旁白 neutral]]
"You don't have to say sorry. It's my fault, I didn't explain clearly. Anyway, as long as you're okay, Xiaocheng, everything's fine..." [[1725 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng sniffled, her voice still weak and tearful, "Taotao isn't mad at me? I... I did so many wrong things before, and now I've made Taotao worry, I..." [[1726 池小橙 sad]]
"Shh!" [[1727 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao pressed her long index finger to Chi Xiaocheng's lips, her forehead gently touching hers. "How could I be mad at Xiaocheng?" she said softly. "Everyone makes mistakes. And you're trying to change now, aren't you? We agreed to have a talk tonight." [[1728 苏桃 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng smiled through her tears, then began to grope around frantically. [[1729 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao asked curiously, "What are you looking for?" [[1730 苏桃 neutral]]
"A gift." [[1731 池小橙 neutral]]
"A gift?" Su Tao didn't understand what Chi Xiaocheng meant, but then she remembered something. "By the way, Xiaocheng, what did you want to tell me on the rooftop?" [[1732 苏桃 neutral]]
"It's about what happened during the day." Chi Xiaocheng fumbled for a moment and finally found the bottle, beautifully wrapped with a ribbon, and carefully handed it to Su Tao. "During the day, you and Ye Liang were like that, you wouldn't even drink my water..." [[1733 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao was stunned for a moment. [[1734 旁白 neutral]]
Then she said, half-amused and half-exasperated, "It was all because of that? Xiaocheng, you're really..." [[1735 苏桃 neutral]]
You're so silly. [[1736 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't notice anything unusual about Chi Xiaocheng. She just thought that giving her a gift late at night because of what happened during the day was Chi Xiaocheng's way of apologizing. [[1737 旁白 neutral]]
Does it feel a bit like she's jealous? [[1738 旁白 neutral]]
She took the gift. It was too dark to see Chi Xiaocheng's expression. [[1739 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao could vaguely feel the anticipation in her eyes. [[1740 旁白 neutral]]
She said softly, "I'll accept this gift, but Xiaocheng has to be good and listen. Let's go back to the dorm first, okay?" [[1741 苏桃 neutral]]
"Okay~" [[1742 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice was very obedient, seemingly softer than usual, with the sweet and sticky quality of a loli. [[1743 旁白 neutral]]
This reminded Su Tao of Chi Xiaocheng in middle school. [[1744 旁白 neutral]]
The current Xiaocheng has become more like she used to be. [[1745 旁白 neutral]]
Although she's worrying, she's also kind of cute? [[1746 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao didn't think too much about it and accepted the gift as Chi Xiaocheng wished. [[1747 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, a loud "BOOM" was accompanied by a flash of lightning. [[1748 旁白 neutral]]
As if to illuminate the entire dark world, the lightning dispelled the fog before Su Tao's eyes, and the so-called gift came into view. [[1749 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's pupils contracted violently, and she suddenly felt the raindrops on her skin sting like icy needles. [[1750 旁白 sad]]
