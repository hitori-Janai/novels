Chapter 189: Like and Possessiveness [[16489 旁白 neutral]]
"If there's an afterlife, if there's a next life, if we could do it all over again, Xiaocheng... I swear, I will never let you go again!" [[16490 苏桃 sad]]
Her words, which felt heavier than a confession, took Chi Xiaocheng by surprise. [[16491 旁白 neutral]]
But she was very happy. [[16492 旁白 happy]]
That's it, Taotao. [[16493 池小橙 happy]]
Hold my hand. [[16494 池小橙 happy]]
Be possessive of me. [[16495 池小橙 happy]]
I will never hate this kind of love from you. [[16496 池小橙 happy]]
Because I've always felt the same way you do now. I want to possess you, keep you by my side forever, and be the only one you love. [[16497 池小橙 happy]]
But forcing things too much makes it hard for it to turn into love. [[16498 池小橙 neutral]]
But... she had no intention of adding any pressure right now. [[16499 旁白 neutral]]
This dream was meant to relieve Su Tao's stress, but the words Chi Xiaocheng just spoke were also from her heart. [[16500 旁白 neutral]]
"I hope you can live a happy life." [[16501 池小橙 happy]]
Even if it means you'll forget me, that's okay. [[16502 池小橙 neutral]]
When I wake up, I'll still come find you. [[16503 池小橙 happy]]
At least I won't blame you if you forget me during the time I'm gone. [[16504 池小橙 sad]]
But how hard is it to forget someone? [[16505 旁白 sad]]
This moment of possession was confined to just this instant. [[16506 旁白 sad]]
Su Tao sniffled and said seriously, "Xiaocheng, I promise you." [[16507 苏桃 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head. "What?" [[16508 池小橙 neutral]]
"I promise you, I'll live a good, normal life from now on. I won't be hard on myself, and I won't make you worry." [[16509 苏桃 neutral]]
"But!" [[16510 苏桃 angry]]
She raised her voice, emphasizing her next words, "I will not forget you, ever!" [[16511 苏桃 angry]]
Chi Xiaocheng's expression became hesitant. "But, if you do that, you'll continue to suffer, won't you, Taotao?" [[16512 池小橙 sad]]
"For you, I'm willing to!" [[16513 苏桃 angry]]
This wasn't her putting on pressure anymore. [[16514 旁白 neutral]]
It was Su Tao putting pressure on herself. [[16515 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng was already gone. How could the emotional pain of her absence compare to the pain of the gunshot when she pushed me away? [[16516 旁白 sad]]
She had already left her. [[16517 旁白 neutral]]
But she would still meet her in dreams, just like now! [[16518 旁白 happy]]
If there was another dream, she didn't want it to be like today, escaping from reality by losing herself in it. [[16519 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she wanted to be able to enjoy such dreams with a clear conscience. [[16520 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng stood on her tiptoes, gently tapping the toe of her shoe against the floor of the cabin. "Why do you have to go that far?" [[16521 池小橙 sad]]
Su Tao took a deep breath, looking at Chi Xiaocheng with deep affection and seriousness. [[16522 旁白 neutral]]
She opened her mouth, as if to shout with all her might. [[16523 旁白 neutral]]
"Because I love you!" [[16524 苏桃 happy]]
She gathered all her strength, her mouth moving with the expression on her face. [[16525 旁白 neutral]]
But the sound didn't travel through the air to Chi Xiaocheng's ears. [[16526 旁白 sad]]
Even Su Tao herself clearly felt that at the moment of her confession, she had lost her voice. [[16527 旁白 sad]]
It wasn't an accident; the dream was reaching its limit. [[16528 旁白 sad]]
The surrounding scenery had already shattered. It was unclear if the Ferris wheel was still turning, and the cabin seemed to have been still in the high air for a long time. [[16529 旁白 sad]]
The wind had stopped, and the moon didn't come out after the sun had set. [[16530 旁白 sad]]
Time in this world seemed to have stopped long ago. [[16531 旁白 sad]]
Her confession had failed again. [[16532 旁白 sad]]
But... [[16533 旁白 neutral]]
"I know, Taotao." [[16534 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng tilted her head, smiling happily. [[16535 旁白 happy]]
Even though you couldn't say it, I know. [[16536 池小橙 happy]]
At this moment, you love me. [[16537 池小橙 happy]]
But in the end, I'm still a little reluctant to leave. [[16538 旁白 sad]]
Even knowing she would be revived in over twenty days. [[16539 旁白 neutral]]
Even knowing she could meet and recognize Su Tao again at that time. [[16540 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[16541 旁白 sad]]
Twenty days is too long. [[16542 旁白 sad]]
"Taotao!" [[16543 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng shouted loudly, "When we meet again someday and you've fallen in love with me, confess to me properly again!" [[16544 池小橙 happy]]
And I will definitely say yes. [[16545 池小橙 happy]]
Her voice was soft, but it still barely reached Su Tao's ears. [[16546 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to step forward and reach out, but the cabin shook, and Su Tao suddenly felt the floor beneath her feet breaking apart. [[16547 旁白 sad]]
And the girl with the beautiful brown hair was smiling happily as she began to disappear into specks of starlight. [[16548 旁白 sad]]
No matter what promises were made, no matter what words were spoken. [[16549 旁白 sad]]
The deepest emotions turned into a fleeting illusion at this moment. [[16550 旁白 sad]]
Only a feeling of reluctance remained in her heart. [[16551 旁白 sad]]
A dream must always end. [[16552 旁白 sad]]
As Chi Xiaocheng faded away into specks of starlight, the cabin disintegrated, and Su Tao looked up through the sky towards the top of the Ferris wheel. [[16553 旁白 sad]]
She suddenly remembered that she had heard about the legends of the Ferris wheel. [[16554 旁白 neutral]]
The first was that a couple who kisses at the top can find eternal happiness. [[16555 旁白 neutral]]
But there was also another legend. [[16556 旁白 neutral]]
Couples who ride a Ferris wheel together are destined to break up and be parted forever. [[16557 旁白 sad]]
Because their happiness has been sealed forever within this small cabin. [[16558 旁白 sad]]
And the moment after the Ferris wheel reaches its highest point, it returns to the beginning. [[16559 旁白 neutral]]
When they reached the top, she couldn't confess to Chi Xiaocheng, they didn't kiss, and there was no sunset's blessing. [[16560 旁白 sad]]
So which ending, which legend, would be hers? [[16561 旁白 sad]]
It turned out that the ending of this dream was destined from the beginning. [[16562 旁白 sad]]
The starlight dissipated. [[16563 旁白 sad]]
The dream shattered. [[16564 旁白 sad]]
When she opened her eyes again, the morning sun was already shining through the window, illuminating a corner of the room. [[16565 旁白 neutral]]
Last night's heavy snow had stopped, and today's morning sun was the warmest of the entire winter. [[16566 旁白 happy]]
It was as if it represented... a new beginning. [[16567 旁白 happy]]
Su Tao didn't feel sleepy at all; she just reached up and touched the corner of her eye. [[16568 旁白 sad]]
Her tears hadn't dried yet. [[16569 旁白 sad]]
In her arms, besides the big brown bear, there was a tabby cat and a small scarecrow. [[16570 旁白 neutral]]
Da Wang was very attached to the scarecrow and had brought it over during the night. [[16571 旁白 neutral]]
The scarecrow's seemingly lifeless eyes now gradually softened. [[16572 旁白 happy]]
"Xiaocheng..." [[16573 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao hugged the cat and the scarecrow in her arms tightly. [[16574 旁白 sad]]
The faint warmth they gave off felt like she was hugging the person she longed for. [[16575 旁白 sad]]
"I... I won't live in a daze like that anymore." [[16576 苏桃 neutral]]
I will live for you, and for myself! [[16577 苏桃 happy]]
After savoring the last five minutes in bed, Su Tao threw off the covers and let out a long breath. [[16578 旁白 neutral]]
"Time to get up!" [[16579 苏桃 happy]]
Her brand new day had begun. [[16580 旁白 happy]]
She turned and walked towards the closet, while the scarecrow, left obediently on the bed, secretly took out the status glasses again. [[16581 旁白 neutral]]
