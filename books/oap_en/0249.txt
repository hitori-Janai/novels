The slap echoed through the hall. Moving her tongue, she could taste blood and feel a gritty texture, like a small piece of stone in her mouth. [[21232 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, it was a tooth. [[21233 旁白 neutral]]
Her face burned, and the pain was so intense it started to feel numb. [[21234 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya heard the guests gasp. The humiliation stung more than her burning cheek. [[21235 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind was buzzing; she couldn't understand what had just happened. [[21236 旁白 neutral]]
That bitch, Su Tao, how dare she hit me! [[21237 林芳雅 angry]]
I have the Second Young Master Ye backing me! How dare a low-life like her! [[21238 林芳雅 angry]]
Isn't she afraid of revenge from the Ye family? Does she think she can do anything just because she has Dongfang Yang's support? [[21239 林芳雅 angry]]
Why would Dongfang Yang fall for a woman like that? She looks like a vixen, and she's not as charming as me, Lin Fangya! [[21240 林芳雅 angry]]
It hurts, it hurts so much! [[21241 林芳雅 sad]]
Before she could process it, she heard Si Chen's voice, "Su Tao, you... don't be impulsive." [[21242 司辰 neutral]]
"Impulsive?" Then came the voice of Su Tao, the woman she hated. "I can ignore her insulting me, but she dared to call Xiaocheng a bitch and even hit her until she bled. How can you expect me to be calm? I think she's the real bitch!" [[21243 苏桃 angry]]
As Su Tao's voice echoed in her ears, Lin Fangya's eyes turned red. "Su Tao, I'm going to tear your face apart!" [[21244 林芳雅 angry]]
Forgetting her image, she spat blood onto the floor, along with the dislodged tooth. Then, like a madwoman, she lunged toward Su Tao, her fingers like claws aiming for her face. [[21245 旁白 neutral]]
Her movements were wide, but in Su Tao's eyes, they were incredibly slow. [[21246 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao snorted coldly and acted in an instant, before Si Chen could stop her. [[21247 旁白 neutral]]
"You—" [[21248 林芳雅 angry]]
Lin Fangya felt her wrist being gripped with immense force. "It hurts... You, let me go!" [[21249 林芳雅 sad]]
"You were screaming pretty loudly when you were insulting my Xiaocheng, weren't you? Why are you begging for mercy now?" [[21250 苏桃 angry]]
How dare she call her a little bitch! [[21251 旁白 neutral]]
Xiaocheng is so cute, so considerate, so well-behaved, and she likes me so much. How dare she call her a bitch! [[21252 旁白 neutral]]
Impulsive or not, she deserves to die! [[21253 旁白 neutral]]
With that thought, Su Tao twisted Lin Fangya's slender arm. [[21254 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahhhhhh—!" [[21255 林芳雅 sad]]
A scream like a pig being slaughtered echoed through the main hall. Lin Fangya's once-straight arm was now bent at a grotesque, twisted angle! [[21256 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao's twist had actually broken her arm! [[21257 旁白 neutral]]
The painful scream made even Si Chen, who was standing behind her, swallow hard. [[21258 旁白 neutral]]
But it wasn't over. Su Tao let go of Lin Fangya and kicked her, sending her flying five meters away. [[21259 旁白 neutral]]
Besides her screams, the only sound in the venue was the sharp inhales of the guests. [[21260 旁白 neutral]]
A tigress! [[21261 旁白 neutral]]
If this were ancient times, that's the word people would have used to describe her. Even now, the men who had felt a flicker of attraction to Su Tao's sweet appearance were now reconsidering. [[21262 旁白 neutral]]
If they pursued this girl, could they even handle her? [[21263 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the scene, it was a question of whether they would even survive to enjoy the relationship. [[21264 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Lin Fangya, collapsed on the floor, clutched her arm and began to mutter a name—Second Young Master Ye. [[21265 旁白 neutral]]
"Second Young Master Ye... Second Young Master Ye, where are you? Didn't you say you would help and protect me!" [[21266 林芳雅 sad]]
"It hurts so much... It hurts so much. You promised me she wouldn't dare to hit me, so why have you disappeared..." [[21267 林芳雅 sad]]
While groaning in pain, Lin Fangya kept calling out the Second Young Master Ye's name. [[21268 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone looked at her as if she were a clown. Despite her pained cries, no one dared to help her up, not even the large group of security guards who had rushed over. They just looked at each other, unsure what to do. [[21269 旁白 neutral]]
The security captain looked at Si Lai nearby. "Third Young Master, what should we do now? Should we handle the situation?" [[21270 保安队长 neutral]]
"Handle your sister!" Si Lai glared at the security captain, not even stopping his hands from cracking open melon seeds, a look of enjoyment on his face. "Can't you see my second brother, Si Chen, is up there? It's obvious he's on that girl's side. Tell them no one is to make a move until my brother gives an order." [[21271 司赖 neutral]]
"In that case, Young Master Si Lai." [[21272 保安队长 neutral]]
"What?" [[21273 司赖 neutral]]
"Share some melon seeds with me." [[21274 保安队长 neutral]]
... [[21275 旁白 neutral]]
The venue fell quiet for a moment, but more people were now watching the drama unfold. They all knew they were waiting for another main character to appear. [[21276 旁白 neutral]]
The Second Young Master Ye. [[21277 旁白 neutral]]
The man who had taken over from Ye Liang as the new head of the Ye family in Jiuzhou City. [[21278 旁白 neutral]]
From her behavior just now, it didn't seem like Lin Fangya was trying to frame Ye Liang on purpose. [[21279 旁白 neutral]]
Si Chen was also waiting, but he was more worried and surprised by Su Tao's sudden outburst. [[21280 旁白 neutral]]
If the Second Young Master Ye appeared now, it would be difficult to resolve the situation peacefully. [[21281 旁白 neutral]]
And Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng were, after all, just two ordinary people. [[21282 旁白 neutral]]
He sighed and said, "Su Tao, I know you want to protect Chi Xiaocheng and stand up for her, but that was still too impulsive. Lin Fangya is the daughter of a minor noble family, and it's clear she has the Ye family backing her now." [[21283 司辰 neutral]]
"This is going to be very hard to clean up." [[21284 司辰 neutral]]
Su Tao took a soft breath, the anger in her eyes fading slightly. She turned to Si Chen, her gaze firm and serious. "I'm sorry for causing you trouble, but if something happens, I'll take full responsibility. It won't affect you or Dongfang Yang." [[21285 苏桃 neutral]]
When her gaze fell on Chi Xiaocheng, it instantly softened. "Of course, Xiaocheng, don't worry. This was an accident. I will definitely protect you!" [[21286 苏桃 happy]]
She had seen Si Chen arrive at Xiaocheng's side. [[21287 旁白 neutral]]
She was just one step too slow. [[21288 旁白 neutral]]
Who would have thought that Lin Fangya would dare to attack Xiaocheng directly! [[21289 旁白 neutral]]
Those insults, that slap, a single arm? [[21290 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao felt that breaking one of her arms wasn't nearly enough! [[21291 旁白 neutral]]
Now, the situation had escalated. All the guests had their eyes fixed on Su Tao. [[21292 旁白 neutral]]
Their stares were like sharp swords, trying to wound her. [[21293 旁白 neutral]]
But Su Tao stood tall in front of Chi Xiaocheng, her high ponytail swaying gently. There was no fear in her eyes as she met their gazes. [[21294 旁白 neutral]]
She had no power or influence and always had to rely on Dongfang Yang when things went wrong. [[21295 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps this time, the stakes were too high, and Dongfang Yang wouldn't be able to step in. She should have been more restrained and avoided causing trouble. [[21296 旁白 neutral]]
Being targeted by nearly everyone in this upper-class circle would have made any ordinary person show fear. [[21297 旁白 neutral]]
But she couldn't be timid. [[21298 旁白 neutral]]
She wouldn't be timid. [[21299 旁白 neutral]]
Her courage came from the girl behind her. [[21300 旁白 neutral]]
Lin Fangya was still howling. Seeing that Su Tao had calmed down, Si Chen waited there as well. Dongfang Yang had his men surround the banquet hall, searching for Xiao Ming. [[21301 旁白 neutral]]
The large group of security guards squatted by the wall, eating melon seeds with Si Chen's younger brother, Si Lai. [[21302 旁白 neutral]]
The guests were already gossiping about how Su Tao and Chi Xiaocheng would face the Second Young Master Ye. [[21303 旁白 neutral]]
Like the main character in a play, the man finally made his grand entrance, with all eyes on him. [[21304 旁白 neutral]]
He wore a gray mink coat, his fluffy hair styled in a middle part. With a rebellious look on his face, he slowly walked in through the main entrance of the hall. [[21305 旁白 neutral]]
A wild smile was always on his lips, but his eyes held a sharp intelligence. [[21306 旁白 neutral]]
Hiding behind Su Tao, Chi Xiaocheng immediately felt the pressure coming from this young master. [[21307 旁白 neutral]]
As a villain in the original novel, he was not someone to be taken lightly. [[21308 旁白 neutral]]
