Chapter 77 The Beginning of Dependence [[6731 旁白 neutral]]
The surrounding clamor lingered in her ears, but Su Tao just held Chi Xiaocheng, her face somewhat blank. [[6732 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song came, and they started fighting again. [[6733 旁白 neutral]]
What he said later, she couldn't quite hear. [[6734 旁白 neutral]]
She just vaguely got into the car with him, her eyes only seeing the weak, pale little face. [[6735 旁白 neutral]]
The car wound its way to Dongfang Yang's private hospital. He had clearly just arrived. After having the doctors lift Chi Xiaocheng onto a stretcher, he frowned at Su Tao. [[6736 旁白 neutral]]
"What happened again? Did she hurt herself again?" [[6737 东方阳 neutral]]
"Ye Liang did it!" Chi Song stood beside Su Tao, his anger undiminished. [[6738 池松 angry]]
Just now, he and his subordinates had a big fight with Ye Liang's bodyguards. [[6739 旁白 neutral]]
None of his ten subordinates had been with him for less than two years, fighting their way up. Even though Ye Liang's bodyguards were professionally trained, that group of people was clearly recruited in a standardized manner. [[6740 旁白 neutral]]
They simply didn't have that ruthlessness. [[6741 旁白 neutral]]
It didn't even take ten minutes for the whole group to be lying on the ground. [[6742 旁白 neutral]]
Their wails were incessant. [[6743 旁白 neutral]]
And Ye Liang, too, was beaten half to death by his anger, covered in bruises. Even so, his pride as a CEO still didn't make him fall or beg for mercy. [[6744 旁白 neutral]]
If Liang Hei hadn't stopped him, saying that the aftermath of Ye Liang's incident would only be worse. [[6745 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song would have at least crippled him. [[6746 旁白 neutral]]
Due to the immense pressure from Chi Xiaocheng, Su Tao's brain briefly crashed, and she lost her rationality. [[6747 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song and his group of subordinates were also rough and careless straight men. [[6748 旁白 neutral]]
They didn't even consider the consequences of beating Ye Liang like that. Only belatedly, fearing that Chi Xiaocheng's orange juice would run out, they quickly took her to the hospital. [[6749 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Song looked at Su Tao, who was still a little dazed, and sighed, "Xiao Tao must have been hit pretty hard too." [[6750 池松 neutral]]
He gently patted her back with his large hand. [[6751 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao suddenly came back to her senses. [[6752 旁白 neutral]]
Her haggard face tried to force a smile, but finding it bitter, she lowered her head again. [[6753 旁白 neutral]]
The tiny snowflakes on her shoulders were not wiped away. [[6754 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, I zoned out." [[6755 苏桃 neutral]]
Su Tao then turned her head and looked at the doctors and nurses going inside, her mood growing heavier and more complex. [[6756 旁白 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang looked at Su Tao, feeling her expression was familiar. [[6757 旁白 neutral]]
That night after the rooftop incident, Su Tao had the same expression for a long time. [[6758 旁白 neutral]]
Like autism, but even more severe than autism. [[6759 旁白 neutral]]
Confused, pained, conflicted, like someone struggling desperately in water. [[6760 旁白 neutral]]
Her extremely haggard face made one's heart ache. [[6761 旁白 neutral]]
Her pink, thin lips were chapped, but she didn't even feel it. [[6762 旁白 neutral]]
After a helpless sigh, Dongfang Yang looked at Chi Song, his gaze flickering from his amputated arm, and asked, "Brother, can you tell me what exactly happened?" [[6763 东方阳 neutral]]
Saying that, Dongfang Yang extended a hand, "My name is Dongfang Yang, and I'm a friend of Chi Xiaocheng and Su Tao." [[6764 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Song was stunned for a moment. [[6765 旁白 neutral]]
After wiping his hand on his clothes a few times, he shook Dongfang Yang's hand and smiled frankly, "My name is Chi Song, and I'm Xiaocheng's brother." [[6766 池松 neutral]]
"I've heard of you." Dongfang Yang glanced at Su Tao, then walked aside with Chi Song, "Su Tao told me that although she's an orphan, she has someone who treats her like a real brother." [[6767 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Song smiled shyly, "Xiao Tao also told me about you." [[6768 池松 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang raised an eyebrow, "Oh? What did Su Tao say about me?" [[6769 东方阳 neutral]]
"She said you're a warm-hearted tsundere, a good person." [[6770 池松 neutral]]
Instantly, Dongfang Yang's face froze. [[6771 旁白 neutral]]
No, brother, let's just boast, don't give me a good person card. [[6772 旁白 neutral]]
When did I, Dongfang Yang, become a tsundere?! [[6773 旁白 neutral]]
He clicked his tongue and decisively changed the subject, "Brother Chi, what do you mean by Ye Liang doing it?" [[6774 东方阳 neutral]]
Chi Song sighed and recounted what had happened there. [[6775 旁白 neutral]]
"When I arrived, I saw that Ye Liang stab my sister with a knife, and he even tried to lay hands on Xiao Tao. I respected him as the young master of the Ye family. These past few days, I knew he was targeting my sister, but I didn't bother him." [[6776 池松 angry]]
"Who would have thought that this guy would go crazy and attack two defenseless girls!" [[6777 池松 angry]]
These two girls looked delicate and tender, and probably wouldn't even dare to kill a chicken. [[6778 旁白 neutral]]
Yet Ye Liang still dared to lay hands on them! [[6779 旁白 neutral]]
He's truly not human! [[6780 旁白 neutral]]
After listening to Chi Song's description, Dongfang Yang couldn't help but gasp. [[6781 旁白 neutral]]
He only knew that Ye Liang and Chi Xiaocheng had a small conflict. [[6782 旁白 neutral]]
But he didn't expect it to escalate so much! [[6783 旁白 neutral]]
However, to know what exactly happened, he still had to ask Su Tao. [[6784 旁白 neutral]]
Returning to the hospital entrance, Dongfang Yang saw Su Tao still sitting on the chair in a daze. He couldn't help but sigh and put away his intention to ask. [[6785 旁白 neutral]]
He looked at her with heartache, "If you're tired, go back and rest, or you can sleep in the hospital. There are many empty rooms here." [[6786 东方阳 neutral]]
Su Tao parted her dry lips, "Xiaocheng... is she okay?" [[6787 苏桃 neutral]]
At this moment, a female doctor walked over, "She's fine. The knife didn't hit any vital organs, and it's not very deep. Her cells are more active than normal people's, so don't worry." [[6788 医生 neutral]]
Hearing the doctor's words, both Su Tao and Dongfang Yang breathed a sigh of relief. [[6789 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao closed her eyes, her voice filled with confusion, "Dongfang Yang, what should I do?" [[6790 苏桃 sad]]
Dongfang Yang said softly, "Don't think so much. Although I don't know what happened, you should go to sleep first. You look terrible." [[6791 东方阳 neutral]]
To describe Su Tao as "terrible" was an understatement. [[6792 旁白 neutral]]
Her hair was disheveled, her face pale, and her eyes, from prolonged pain and frowning, had tiny wrinkles. Her usually beautiful eyes were now pitifully lacking in color. [[6793 旁白 neutral]]
She looked as if she had been broken, her whole being exuding an aura of desperate melancholy. [[6794 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao opened her mouth, looking pleadingly at the handsome man in front of her, "Dongfang Yang, can you talk to me for a while?" [[6795 苏桃 neutral]]
Dongfang Yang's heart softened, but he still shook his head, "Sorry, Su Tao. You two have caused such a big incident. Not to mention Ye Liang himself, his people will also investigate and target you and Chi Xiaocheng." [[6796 东方阳 neutral]]
"Before things escalate, I must deal with it, otherwise it will affect your future lives." [[6797 东方阳 neutral]]
With that, Dongfang Yang looked at Chi Song, "Brother Chi, you were too impulsive earlier. Come with me. At least you need to apologize. With me by your side, they won't make things difficult for you, and this matter might have a chance to turn over a new leaf." [[6798 东方阳 neutral]]
Watching Dongfang Yang and Chi Song bid farewell and leave, Su Tao leaned against the wall, slowly got up, and walked aimlessly out of the hospital. [[6799 旁白 neutral]]
She called Si Chen's phone. [[6800 旁白 neutral]]
The call didn't connect. [[6801 旁白 neutral]]
She sent a message to Doctor Cheng. [[6802 旁白 neutral]]
Doctor Cheng was busy and didn't read it. [[6803 旁白 neutral]]
Chen Qian and her roommate were nowhere to be found, unreachable. [[6804 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if everyone who could listen to her and be her support, related to Chi Xiaocheng, had disappeared. [[6805 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, she had other friends, but... [[6806 旁白 neutral]]
Could she tell them about this? Chi Xiaocheng was already like this towards Ye Liang. Would involving more people hurt them? [[6807 旁白 neutral]]
Things bottled up in her heart, growing heavier. [[6808 旁白 neutral]]
Just walking aimlessly, unconsciously, Su Tao found herself at Chi Xiaocheng's doorstep. [[6809 旁白 neutral]]
This large door brought back scene after scene from the dark room a week ago. [[6810 旁白 neutral]]
Breathing... so painful. [[6811 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking... so uncomfortable. [[6812 旁白 neutral]]
She wanted to give up thinking, give up reality, give up everything. [[6813 旁白 neutral]]
But falling down here, what's the difference from abandoning Xiaocheng? [[6814 旁白 neutral]]
But if she didn't abandon her, was the current Xiaocheng still Xiaocheng? [[6815 旁白 neutral]]
Fear, terror. [[6816 旁白 neutral]]
Conflict, struggle. [[6817 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao desperately wanted to find something that could be her support, something to relieve her pressure. [[6818 旁白 neutral]]
No matter what it was, whether it would make her uncomfortable, as long as it could make her forget everything that happened today! [[6819 旁白 neutral]]
She slowly walked into the living room, then suddenly looked at the counter, her Adam's apple bobbing. [[6820 旁白 neutral]]
She felt like... having a drink. [[6821 旁白 neutral]]
