Chapter 260: Hold It In!!! [[22153 旁白 neutral]]
The evening wind was cool, but the Special Envoy felt himself sweating all over, his hands trembling from the heat. [[22154 旁白 neutral]]
He had come to terms with it. [[22155 旁白 neutral]]
Loyalty to his mission was nothing compared to loyalty to Cheng. [[22156 旁白 neutral]]
Nothing was more important than his own life. [[22157 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, he had defected to the enemy. [[22158 旁白 neutral]]
Now, he was sent outside the house to stand guard. Besides the sound of flowing water, he could occasionally hear Lin Fangya's wails from the house behind him. [[22159 旁白 neutral]]
Mixed in were a few different sounds. [[22160 旁白 neutral]]
It was the other girl's voice, seemingly full of affection, calling out "Taotao." [[22161 旁白 neutral]]
He couldn't hear what was being said clearly, but the Special Envoy felt a chill creep up his neck and back. [[22162 旁白 neutral]]
His forehead was sweating, but his hands and feet were freezing cold. [[22163 旁白 neutral]]
Although few people would pass by such a gloomy place late at night, it was by the river, and dedicated fishermen would show up even if a meteor fell from the sky. It was good to be cautious. [[22164 旁白 neutral]]
Even if he were to run... [[22165 旁白 neutral]]
To be honest, his legs were so weak he couldn't even run. [[22166 旁白 neutral]]
The Special Envoy lit a cigarette. The sharp sensation helped him relax a little. His eyes accidentally glanced at Da Wang, who was also squatting nearby. "Where did this stupid cat come from? What are you looking at?" [[22167 特使 angry]]
Da Wang: "?" [[22168 大王 neutral]]
The proud tabby cat tilted its head, meowed once, and immediately walked towards the dilapidated house. [[22169 旁白 neutral]]
Watching its elegant catwalk, a strange thought appeared in the Special Envoy's mind. [[22170 旁白 neutral]]
This cat... it can't understand what I'm saying, can it? [[22171 特使 neutral]]
Holy cow, did it come with that little girl?! [[22172 特使 neutral]]
The Special Envoy was so scared he dropped his cigarette and quickly blocked Da Wang's path. [[22173 旁白 neutral]]
He said with a grin, "Master Cat, Master Cat, don't be angry, I..." [[22174 特使 happy]]
He was only halfway through his sentence when he saw Da Wang looked annoyed. He immediately crouched down, peeked at the cat's underside, and quickly said, "Granny Cat, Granny Cat, don't be mad. I was just joking with you." [[22175 特使 happy]]
"Here, Granny Cat, have a cigarette. We'll have a grand old time together." [[22176 特使 happy]]
Time passed quickly. [[22177 旁白 neutral]]
In the blink of an eye, half a day went by. When the Special Envoy was called back into the room, he saw a barely breathing Lin Fangya. [[22178 旁白 neutral]]
On the outside, she didn't seem to be badly hurt. As for the actual situation... [[22179 旁白 neutral]]
The Special Envoy didn't dare to ask, nor did he dare to find out. [[22180 旁白 neutral]]
His scalp tingling, he looked at Chi Xiaocheng and stammered, "My lady... I've checked the area. There's no one around, and they definitely can't hear your voice. Don't worry." [[22181 特使 sad]]
Chi Xiaocheng waved her hand, signaling for the Special Envoy to come outside the hut to talk. [[22182 旁白 neutral]]
After getting her "simple" revenge for Taotao, Chi Xiaocheng's reason was gradually returning. [[22183 旁白 neutral]]
Although her eyes were still crimson, the red glow within them had faded a lot. [[22184 旁白 neutral]]
She took off her hood. The cool wind swayed her ponytail, and the refreshing feeling gradually eased the anxiety in Chi Xiaocheng's heart. [[22185 旁白 neutral]]
She glanced sideways at the Special Envoy, who kept his head down, afraid to look at her face, and said lightly, "I thought you would have run away." [[22186 池小橙 neutral]]
The Special Envoy gave an awkward laugh, "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare." [[22187 特使 sad]]
"Perfect then." Chi Xiaocheng took out a pill and tossed it to the Special Envoy. "Eat this." [[22188 池小橙 neutral]]
"This is...?" [[22189 特使 neutral]]
"Poison. You can choose to end up like Lin Fangya, or you can try to escape. Your choice." [[22190 池小橙 neutral]]
The Special Envoy's mouth twitched. Did he have a choice? [[22191 旁白 neutral]]
Not at all. [[22192 旁白 neutral]]
He tilted his head back, threw the pill into his mouth, took a small bottle of liquor from his pocket, and washed it down. [[22193 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the mysterious pill went down, he felt a fiery dragon churning in his stomach, causing immense pain. [[22194 旁白 neutral]]
He had seen a lot during his time abroad. [[22195 旁白 neutral]]
But this was the first time he had ever encountered such a poison! [[22196 旁白 neutral]]
Although the little girl's figure was hidden by her cloak, he could vaguely tell she was small. Yet, her strength was enough to easily twist Lin Fangya's arm like a pretzel. [[22197 旁白 neutral]]
She was powerful beyond her age. [[22198 旁白 neutral]]
And now this terrifying poison. [[22199 旁白 neutral]]
There was no doubt about it, this little girl was one of those terrifying beings—an ancient martial artist! [[22200 旁白 neutral]]
As his mind was racing, the Special Envoy suddenly felt his whole body go weak. [[22201 旁白 neutral]]
The pain in his stomach had turned from a dull ache to a sharp, twisting pain! [[22202 旁白 neutral]]
But... [[22203 旁白 neutral]]
Rumor had it that every ancient martial artist was a monster. [[22204 旁白 neutral]]
This must be a test from the young lady before him. To even become one of her dogs, he had to endure this poison. [[22205 旁白 neutral]]
Think about what Lord Dragon King said! [[22206 旁白 neutral]]
Think about all the training he had endured over the years! [[22207 旁白 neutral]]
Think about the principles the Asura Hall established after returning to the country! [[22208 旁白 neutral]]
It's just a little poison, right? [[22209 旁白 neutral]]
Hold it in!!! [[22210 旁白 neutral]]
The Special Envoy's face hardened. He muffled his voice and asked Chi Xiaocheng, "I've taken the poison. From today on, I am your subordinate. Please give me your orders!" [[22211 特使 neutral]]
Seeing the Special Envoy's unchanging expression, Chi Xiaocheng couldn't help but feel a hint of admiration. [[22212 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, what she gave him wasn't poison. That was too expensive and would waste Emotion Points. This was just a strong laxative she bought from the System. [[22213 旁白 neutral]]
The item description said it worked extremely fast and was guaranteed to cause diarrhea for a full day and night. [[22214 旁白 neutral]]
As expected of Xiao Ming's subordinate, he really can endure! [[22215 旁白 neutral]]
Truly admirable. [[22216 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng silently moved a little farther away from him, lest he suddenly "explode," and then asked, "Tell me about your situation, and any information related to Xiao Ming." [[22217 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yes, my la... yes, my lord." [[22218 特使 neutral]]
He changed his form of address, his voice strained with pain. "I don't have a name. In the Asura Hall, my codename is 'Qiu.' I am a subordinate of the Dragon King, Xiao Ming. In the entire Asura Hall, I am at the fourth tier." [[22219 秋 neutral]]
"The Asura Hall is divided into five levels. Level one is the highest, and level five is the lowest. Although I am a special envoy, I am actually just an ordinary person on the fringes. It's rumored that Dragon King Xiao Ming and all the level-five members are ancient martial artists capable of splitting boulders." [[22220 秋 neutral]]
"We approached Lin Fangya this time because we wanted to use the Lin family's resources to pave the way for our brothers." [[22221 秋 neutral]]
He revealed almost all the information he knew about the Asura Hall. [[22222 旁白 neutral]]
It was a top mercenary organization from abroad, specializing in shady business like assassinations and drug trafficking. [[22223 旁白 neutral]]
And Xiao Ming was the new Dragon King, with a very high reputation in the Asura Hall. [[22224 旁白 neutral]]
Now that he had returned to the country, he was trying to build up his power here. [[22225 旁白 neutral]]
After getting the general background information, Chi Xiaocheng continued to ask, "So where is your Dragon King, Xiao Ming, now?" [[22226 池小橙 neutral]]
Special Envoy Qiu continued to endure the pain in his stomach and said slowly, "I don't know where the Dragon King is either. The ones who usually contact me are other special envoys." [[22227 秋 sad]]
"What about your next move?" [[22228 池小橙 neutral]]
"Uh... we don't have any immediate plans for now. Taking control of the Lin family in Jiuzhou City is our current objective." [[22229 秋 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng was a little surprised to hear this. [[22230 旁白 neutral]]
This Xiao Ming wasn't targeting her and Su Tao like Lin Fangya? [[22231 旁白 neutral]]
Chi Xiaocheng thought that after receiving some of Ye Liang's "inheritance," he would also target her and Su Tao. [[22232 旁白 neutral]]
She remembered something and asked again, "By the way, why did your Dragon King have to hold back for three years?" [[22233 池小橙 neutral]]
"Uh..." Special Envoy Qiu was at a loss for words, an embarrassed expression on his face. [[22234 旁白 neutral]]
He lowered his head as if he were talking about something extremely shameful. "The border crossing is very strict recently. It will take about three years for all the brothers to get visas to return to the country, so..." [[22235 秋 sad]]
As soon as he said this, Chi Xiaocheng almost broke into a sweat. [[22236 旁白 neutral]]
So he's holding back for three years because he doesn't feel safe without his crew in the country, right? [[22237 旁白 neutral]]
This is getting ridiculous. [[22238 旁白 neutral]]
