Chapter 17: Am I still not as important as Chi Xiaocheng? [[1483 旁白 neutral]]
No, no, no, no! [[1484 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao's breathing quickened as she stared intently at the new message on WeChat. [[1485 旁白 neutral]]
Waiting for me on the rooftop? [[1486 苏桃 sad]]
In such strong wind and heavy rain! [[1487 苏桃 sad]]
She hoped it was just one of Chi Xiaocheng's pranks. [[1488 旁白 neutral]]
In this weather, with Chi Xiaocheng's weak constitution, she couldn't bear to imagine what would happen if she stayed in the rain for so long! [[1489 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, Ye Liang walked over, noticed Su Tao's uneasy expression, and asked with concern, "Is something wrong?" [[1490 叶良 neutral]]
Su Tao glanced at him and, with trembling lips, made an excuse, "Xiaocheng is stuck in the rain and can't get back. She wants me to bring her an umbrella." [[1491 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang scoffed, "She should just wait for the rain to stop. The wind and rain are so heavy, even cars can barely drive, let alone a person. You're going to deliver an umbrella?" [[1492 叶良 neutral]]
He glanced at Su Tao's slender figure under her dress. "Forget the umbrella, you'd be blown away yourself." [[1493 叶良 neutral]]
He then shrugged and added, "Just let her fend for herself. The event is about to start, shouldn't we go in?" [[1494 叶良 neutral]]
"You... you wait for me a moment." Still worried, Su Tao took her phone to the side. "I'm going to make a call." [[1495 苏桃 sad]]
With that, she directly called Chi Xiaocheng on WeChat. [[1496 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't hear Chi Xiaocheng's voice yet. [[1497 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, her ears were filled with the sound of howling wind and pounding rain. [[1498 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of rumbling thunder made Su Tao realize that Chi Xiaocheng was definitely not indoors. [[1499 旁白 neutral]]
On the rooftop! [[1500 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao panicked and anxiously said, "Xiaocheng! Xiaocheng, can you hear me?" [[1501 苏桃 sad]]
On the other side, Chi Xiaocheng, standing under a rain shelter on the rooftop, heard Su Tao's anxious voice and couldn't help but sigh internally. [[1502 旁白 neutral]]
So this is the universally loved female lead. [[1503 池小橙 neutral]]
Even though I'm just the sidekick. [[1504 池小橙 neutral]]
Even though I've done so many terrible things to her. [[1505 池小橙 neutral]]
She still forgives me and offers her care and trust without hesitation. [[1506 池小橙 neutral]]
Having been betrayed by her girlfriend twice in her past life, Chi Xiaocheng cherished this kind of concern that poured down like a rainstorm. [[1507 旁白 neutral]]
Keeping her act up, her voice was flat and emotionless. "I can hear your voice, Taotao. What's wrong?" [[1508 池小橙 neutral]]
In the cruise ship's main hall, Su Tao sighed in relief but quickly said, "Xiaocheng, I can't come back that quickly. Please go downstairs, okay? The rooftop is windy and rainy, it's very dangerous!" [[1509 苏桃 sad]]
However, Chi Xiaocheng seemed to only hear the key part of her sentence. "Go downstairs?" [[1510 池小橙 neutral]]
"Yes." Su Tao didn't catch the hidden meaning in Chi Xiaocheng's words, and realizing her own tone was off, she softened her voice. "Go downstairs first, return to your dorm, take a hot shower, and rest. We can talk about whatever it is when I get back, okay? I should be able to leave around 11." [[1511 苏桃 sad]]
"But we made a promise. I have to wait for you. Didn't we agree?" [[1512 池小橙 neutral]]
How could she not know that Chi Xiaocheng had slipped back into that strange state from the basement? [[1513 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't have time to think about whether this was her true nature or just a temporary, illness-like state. [[1514 旁白 neutral]]
Su Tao tried to keep her tone from sounding too urgent and persuaded her, "It's just a chat, we can do it anywhere. When I get back, I'll listen carefully to whatever you have to say, Xiaocheng. We can have a good talk then." [[1515 苏桃 sad]]
"What will we talk about then?" Chi Xiaocheng asked again. [[1516 池小橙 neutral]]
Su Tao bit her lower lip, glanced at Ye Liang not far away, and lowered her voice. "We'll talk about... the fact that you like me, Xiaocheng. I have a lot I want to say to you too. So be good and go back and wait for me." [[1517 苏桃 sad]]
"Then it's the same if I wait for you here. After all, we agreed." [[1518 池小橙 neutral]]
The rain is so heavy, how is that the same! [[1519 旁白 neutral]]
Since the soft approach wasn't working, Su Tao had to be firm. [[1520 旁白 neutral]]
So she said to Chi Xiaocheng, "Xiaocheng, listen to me and go downstairs. If you don't listen, then I won't come back, and I won't talk with you." [[1521 苏桃 angry]]
It was always like this when they were young. [[1522 旁白 neutral]]
As long as she acted like she was about to get angry. [[1523 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how much of a tantrum Chi Xiaocheng was throwing, she would obediently listen. [[1524 旁白 neutral]]
She was occasionally mischievous, but most of the time, she was very sensible. [[1525 旁白 neutral]]
This time was no different. [[1526 旁白 neutral]]
Hearing Su Tao's serious voice, Chi Xiaocheng's tone softened again, just like before, and sounded a little hurt. "Alright then, I'll listen to you." [[1527 池小橙 sad]]
"Okay, okay, I promise I'll be back soon!" [[1528 苏桃 happy]]
At this, Su Tao finally breathed a sigh of relief. [[1529 旁白 neutral]]
She had been clashing with Chi Xiaocheng for the past two months and couldn't get close to her at all. [[1530 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know what had happened. [[1531 旁白 neutral]]
It must be her so-called group of sisters who led Xiaocheng astray! [[1532 旁白 neutral]]
After she gets back from the party, she can finally have a proper talk with Xiaocheng. [[1533 旁白 neutral]]
As she was thinking this, Chi Xiaocheng's voice was heard again over the sound of the rain on the call, "If I go down, will Taotao definitely come back?" [[1534 池小橙 sad]]
"Be good." Su Tao's voice became gentle again. "I won't lie to you, Xiaocheng. Don't worry." [[1535 苏桃 happy]]
"Okay!" [[1536 池小橙 happy]]
Chi Xiaocheng's voice sounded a bit more cheerful. [[1537 旁白 neutral]]
The conversation seemed to end there, but the WeChat call didn't disconnect. Su Tao wanted to keep listening to make sure the sound of the rain would get quieter, confirming Chi Xiaocheng had gone back inside. [[1538 旁白 neutral]]
But as she listened, she realized the rain wasn't getting any quieter. [[1539 旁白 neutral]]
It didn't sound like she had gone indoors at all. [[1540 旁白 neutral]]
After a while. [[1541 旁白 neutral]]
The voice on the phone finally changed, and Chi Xiaocheng's soft, emotionless voice came through, "If I go down, Taotao will come back." [[1542 池小橙 neutral]]
"The 14th floor is a bit high." [[1543 池小橙 neutral]]
Hearing this, Su Tao froze for a moment. [[1544 旁白 neutral]]
"Xiaocheng!" [[1545 苏桃 sad]]
She realized too late and shouted, losing all her composure. [[1546 旁白 neutral]]
"Beep, beep, beep—" [[1547 旁白 neutral]]
The call had already been disconnected. [[1548 旁白 neutral]]
She frantically tried to redial, but she couldn't get through. [[1549 旁白 neutral]]
"Su Tao, are you done with your call? The event is about to start, we need to head to the exhibition hall inside the cruise ship." [[1550 叶良 neutral]]
Just then, Ye Liang walked over and saw Su Tao fumbling with her phone, her face filled with anxiety. [[1551 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't get through to Chi Xiaocheng's WeChat, and even calling her mobile number resulted in a notification that the phone was off. She lost her composure. [[1552 旁白 neutral]]
She even imagined Chi Xiaocheng falling from the 14th floor with her phone. [[1553 旁白 neutral]]
The phone would be shattered to pieces. [[1554 旁白 neutral]]
And the person would be... [[1555 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't dare to think further and quickly said to Ye Liang, "Ye Liang, I... I have to go back to the university. I'm not attending the party. Can you take me back?" [[1556 苏桃 sad]]
Ye Liang frowned, a hint of the annoyance that had been building since the car ride finally showing on his face. "What are you talking about, Su Tao? This party is extremely important to me. I even invited my family for you. The main event is about to start, and you want to go back now?" [[1557 叶良 angry]]
"Xiaocheng is in danger, I have to go back!" [[1558 苏桃 sad]]
Su Tao knew this was no time for long explanations and stated her purpose directly. [[1559 旁白 neutral]]
It would take half an hour to drive back to the university from here. [[1560 旁白 neutral]]
She needed help! [[1561 旁白 neutral]]
But— [[1562 旁白 neutral]]
Ye Liang was not happy. [[1563 旁白 neutral]]
He already disliked Chi Xiaocheng and had been annoyed to death by her before. The girl he liked had been kidnapped and taken to a basement, which not only ruined his reputation at the last party but also nearly got Su Tao hurt. [[1564 旁白 neutral]]
And now she was causing trouble again. [[1565 旁白 neutral]]
He unconsciously clenched his fists, raised his head arrogantly, his face ashen. "Chi Xiaocheng, Chi Xiaocheng, it's always Chi Xiaocheng. After everything she's done to you, why do you still care about her?!" [[1566 叶良 angry]]
The same sharp, forceful, and non-negotiable tone as always. [[1567 旁白 neutral]]
The imposing aura of a CEO or young master from a powerful family, cultivated over years of being in a position of authority, erupted in an instant. He was like the thunder outside, powerful and overwhelming. [[1568 旁白 neutral]]
With such a display, it wasn't just ordinary girls; even those in high-ranking positions would have to yield after understanding Ye Liang's background. [[1569 旁白 neutral]]
Several times, just by being slightly more serious and lowering his voice, Ye Liang could make Su Tao shrink back and give in. [[1570 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, Ye Liang noticed that the stubborn girl's eyes were filled with determination and resolve. [[1571 旁白 neutral]]
