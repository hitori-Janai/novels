Chapter 95: Celeste [[5338 旁白 neutral]]
    When the four arrived, they completely woke up the immortal monster that had been sleeping for a thousand years. Even the heavy coffin lid could no longer suppress it in the dark, confined space. [[5339 旁白 neutral]]
    "Buzz—!" [[5340 旁白 neutral]]
    A heavy buzzing sound echoed in their ears, and a scarlet light almost shot up into the sky. Even though it was underground and covered by the ground, the light seemed to ignore all physical obstacles, piercing through and directly penetrating the sky. [[5341 旁白 neutral]]
    The still pool water was like a boiling oil pot. Scarlet blood overflowed from the gaps in the constantly trembling metal coffin. When the blood poured into the stagnant water, in just an instant, the entire pool of water transformed into churning blood. [[5342 旁白 fearful]]
    The boiling blood surged out from the pool's stone walls, spreading across the ground, and began to advance and erode towards the four people's feet with an unstoppable momentum. [[5343 旁白 fearful]]
    "Your Highness, the wind, it's not enough!" [[5344 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
    Isabella's body was almost completely pressed against the pole of her spear, her beautiful gray hair was disheveled by the wind, and she tightly closed her eyes, shouting as if with all her might. [[5345 旁白 neutral]]
    Even now, she still couldn't control the first iron coffin to successfully land within the magic circle. The power of the iron box resisted her, and the wind in her domain became chaotic due to the malice she unleashed. [[5346 旁白 sad]]
    André leaped from the air to the ground, hastily pulled out several silver talismans from his pocket, activated them with magic, and threw them towards the blood on the ground, attempting to cut it off. [[5347 旁白 neutral]]
    But the truth was, he could only watch as the silver talismans sank into the red liquid, making a few gurgling sounds, as if dissolved by an acidic solution, and then showed no more reaction. [[5348 旁白 surprised]]
    "Damn, so fierce right from the start?" [[5349 安德烈 surprised]]
    André cursed silently in his heart. Just as he was about to pull out the two gun-swords stuck in the iron coffin to deal with another one, his hand stretched out but froze in mid-air. [[5350 旁白 neutral]]
    The man's fingertips trembled. He just felt that the wisp of breeze just now was a bit different. The wind stroked his skin, as if it took away a part of his body weight, and his body suddenly became lighter. [[5351 旁白 surprised]]
    "What is this?" [[5352 安德烈 surprised]]
    A certain conjecture burst forth in his mind, and before he could turn back to verify it, a wisp of seemingly illusory pure white feather floated past his eyes, completely confirming what he had just thought. The divine radiance was once again conceived from the depths of darkness, and this time, the girl who called herself Moying did not hide anything! [[5353 旁白 surprised]]
    "Isabella, it's enough! If the wind isn't enough, use mine!" [[5354 墨莺 neutral]]
    The girl's soft yet resolute voice was extremely clear amidst countless mixed sounds. Stopping her chant, she spread her arms, and emerald green light bloomed from her small, delicate body. Energy ripples flowed in her jade-colored green eyes, forming the shape of a white feather in the center of her pupils. [[5355 旁白 neutral]]
    One, two, three... countless pure white feathers fell from the sky. Although the underground sky was obscured by rocks, under Moying's control, it seemed as if goose-down snow was directly falling within the confined space. The falling pure white feathers soared freely amidst the emerald green wind elements. [[5356 旁白 neutral]]
    [Divine Domain • Wind • Clear Sky Between A Thousand Feathers] [[5357 旁白 neutral]]
    The moment the domain fully formed, André felt as if his heavy body had also transformed into a wisp of the thousand winds, and his consciousness became a freely drifting white feather in the wind. All negative physical or mental states such as fear, ominousness, and confusion were dispelled by the clear wind within this domain. [[5358 旁白 neutral]]
    The man lowered his head, looking at the palms of his hands. His mind detached from the hurried state of amazement. Following the wind, he looked towards the center where the source of everything was. The wind not only dispelled fear, but also blew away the black and white nun's habit she was wearing. Active wind spirits shuttled between her fair skin, weaving a beautiful gown like a poem. [[5359 旁白 neutral]]
    At this moment, she was no longer the Holy Nun Moying. The moment she unleashed a domain belonging exclusively to a Saintess and put on a Saintess's robe belonging exclusively to a Saintess, she truly revealed her most authentic form to the world: the Wind Saintess — Celeste Windermere. [[5360 旁白 neutral]]
    "Finally, revealed?" [[5361 安德烈 neutral]]
    Just as André sighed inwardly, a golden light suddenly flashed before his eyes, followed by the appearance of the familiar golden panel. [[5362 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[5363 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[5364 旁白 neutral]]
    [Divinity release detected, analyzing...] [[5365 旁白 neutral]]
    [Analysis complete. Results as follows:] [[5366 旁白 neutral]]
    Skill Name: Clear Sky Between A Thousand Feathers [[5367 旁白 neutral]]
    Skill Description: Unfold a pure wind feather domain. All allies become immune to negative status effects and gain [Divine Speed], [Purity], and [Clear Mind] buffs. The Saintess herself additionally gains [Clear Insight]: perceive the weaknesses of all things, greatly increasing penetration, critical hit rate, and defense-ignoring abilities. [[5368 旁白 neutral]]
    [Tip: The panel skill description is for reference only. Please refer to actual effects.] [[5369 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[5370 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[5371 旁白 neutral]]
    Reading this text was just a glance, but it took André tens of seconds to fully digest the information it contained, standing愣 in place. [[5372 旁白 surprised]]
    "What the hell? What did he just see?" [[5373 安德烈 surprised]]
    Within the domain, all allies are immune to negative status effects... He reread it several times, to make sure he hadn't missed anything, but the facts proved to him that there were no restrictive clauses added behind this text. [[5374 旁白 surprised]]
    In an instant, he once again deeply understood a saying he heard when playing games in his previous life: simple text description, ultimate effect. [[5375 旁白 neutral]]
    "So, the fewer the words, the stronger the skill?!" [[5376 安德烈 surprised]]
    Aside from a range limit, mass immunity to negative status effects... Seriously, game designers, the Wind Saintess isn't scheming, but my Moying is a bit of a letdown. [[5377 安德烈 neutral]]
    Facts proved that the abilities of the girls chosen by gods in this world were indeed subtly cunning. Isabella's still-active wind domain directly broke free from her control and automatically merged into the Divine Domain unleashed by Celeste. [[5378 旁白 neutral]]
    In a fixed area, releasing multiple domains is akin to lion prides vying for territory on the grasslands. Domains of equal quality will collide, invade, or compress each other until one side's domain is completely broken. However, this is a struggle between domains of people with comparable strength. If it's a collision between a high-level domain and a low-level domain, a war will not even be triggered, because from both game text and real-world perspectives, a high-level domain will directly devour or overwrite a low-level domain. [[5379 旁白 neutral]]
    This is the rule of the game, and also the law of the world. [[5380 旁白 neutral]]
    A thousand feathers brushed away the dust of this world, and the clear mountain wind dispersed the haze that covered the sky. The blood aggressively advancing on the ground seemed unaffected by the domain. André stood there, watching as the blood completely occupied every inch of clean ground beneath his feet, attempting to cover and climb up his shoes, and infect upwards... [[5381 旁白 neutral]]
    The result? It failed... [[5382 旁白 surprised]]
    Even if this blood were a caterpillar with unsteady legs, it couldn't climb up. It barely managed to climb an inch onto his shoe, but then, as if cunning, it retreated. [[5383 旁白 neutral]]
    Going up and down, up and down, André watched the persistent, eerie blood on the ground with a twitching mouth. Deep down, he even felt a slight urge to laugh. [[5384 旁白 neutral]]
    "So, this is the true authority wielded by the Wind Saintess, one of the Six Saints?" [[5385 安德烈 neutral]]
