Chapter 3: Reset 3 - Has the System Update Arrived? [[114 Narration neutral]]
Before he could react, a golden light flashed before his eyes and shot into the space between his eyebrows. [[115 Narration neutral]]
In that moment, the aura of his body was no longer suppressed and began to reveal itself... Just kidding. It was just a daydream. [[116 Selen An neutral]]
The cheat system he had imagined didn't arrive, nor did he hear the familiar "ding" from typical web novels. The golden light simply gathered before his eyes, eventually forming a golden panel floating in mid-air. [[117 Narration neutral]]
Text appeared on the panel: [[118 Narration neutral]]

Arrogant and Domineering (Recovery greatly increased) [As a noble, you believe you are naturally superior to the commoners. Please look down on people with your nose in the air. This is the pride of a noble!] [[134 Narration neutral]]
Treasure: [[135 Narration neutral]]
Sword of Peace (Unsealed) [Proof of the Water Saintess's successor, symbolizing peace. It has never been sharpened. "A blade without an edge, for true peace requires no killing" — The teardrop-shaped emblem of the Water God is engraved on the hilt.] [[136 Narration neutral]]
... [[137 Narration neutral]]
Although he knew the original owner of this body was a weakling drained by women, with terrible stats, he still couldn't help but get excited for a moment when the panel appeared. [[138 Narration neutral]]
What if? What if he was favored by the goddess of luck? [[139 Selen An hopeful]]
With the anticipation of opening a mystery box, he read through all the data on the panel, then looked away with a blank expression. [[140 Selen An sad]]
He admitted he was a curious cat. Even knowing it was garbage, he felt a rebellious urge to taste it for himself. [[141 Selen An angry]]
Damn it! [[142 Selen An angry]]
Could these stats be any more useless?! [[143 Selen An angry]]
Setting aside the "Half-Succubus Transformation" tag on his race, just look at the stats. At first glance, you might think there's something decent, but all the key stats are D. What's the point of having such high stamina and recovery? [[144 Selen An angry]]
In other games, this might be a highlight, but this is an adult game world. In the future, he would even become a female succubus. High stamina and recovery, in short, just meant he was "durable" in bed! [[145 Selen An angry]]
And this skill, Marksmanship Expertise, seems fine at first glance. But on second thought, the original owner of this body was a direct descendant with the purest bloodline of the Water Saintess. [[146 Narration neutral]]
In the continent of Nephalem, every Saintess followed the path of a traditional mage. Damn it, his ancestor was a top-tier mage, and he, the descendant, was supposed to use a crossbow? [[147 Selen An angry]]
Giving up being a mage to be an archer? [[148 Selen An angry]]
This was completely outrageous, not loyal at all! [[149 Selen An angry]]
The game designer who filled this character's panel with such nonsense must have been drunk. [[150 Selen An angry]]
But that wasn't even the most ridiculous part. Compared to the class skills below, it was nothing. [[151 Narration neutral]]
If you don't want to give class skills, then don't. But using negative idioms like "Afraid of Death" and "Arrogant and Domineering" as skills? [[152 Selen An angry]]
Look at this skill description, especially "Arrogant and Domineering." Is it afraid that he, the Profligate Scion, won't die fast enough? [[153 Selen An angry]]
Looking down on people with his nose in the air? If he dared to do that to the old nun outside the carriage right now, he'd probably be crawling on the ground like a dog for her in a few days. [[154 Selen An fearful]]
Seeing all this was already infuriating enough, but the final treasure truly made him laugh in anger. [[155 Selen An angry]]
He thought that even if the attributes and skills were unreliable, a real treasure would be useful, right? [[156 Selen An hopeful]]
The Sword of Peace, unsharpened because it symbolizes peace. Heh, heh... [[157 Selen An angry]]
Never mind that it has no special bonuses, this unsharpened, blunt sword is basically a fire poker. It's not even as useful as a farmer's hoe from the side of the road! [[158 Selen An angry]]
In short, looking over the entire panel, it could be summed up in one word—despair. [[159 Narration neutral]]
It was so damn hopeless. There was nothing useful at all. [[160 Selen An sad]]
The only seemingly useful skill, "Marksmanship Expertise," was useless since he didn't have any ranged weapons. It was like a swordsman without a sword, powerless in a fight. [[161 Selen An sad]]
In this situation, it seemed that apart from suddenly awakening his bloodline, he could only pray for a miracle from the Water God his family had believed in for generations. [[162 Selen An fearful]]
But as everyone knew, among the six creator gods, the Water God was the only one who had fallen into a deep slumber for no reason. This was why the one who issued the divine oracle to hunt him down for blaspheming the Water God's faith was the Ice God instead. [[163 Narration neutral]]
Because in the myths, the Water God of peace and the Ice God of judgment were sisters. He had been targeted by a god with a protective sister complex! [[164 Selen An fearful]]
I'm so dead! [[165 Selen An fearful]]
Selen An couldn't help but curse the original owner of this body for being such a troublemaker. If he had just stayed quietly in his great family and not caused trouble, the family would have provided for him because of his bloodline and status. His only task would have been to be a qualified stud, producing heirs for the direct line. Life would have been carefree. But now? [[166 Selen An angry]]
He craved some so-called power, wanted to awaken his bloodline. [[167 Selen An angry]]
Come on, it's good to be ambitious, but can't you use your brain? Asking the Demon Clan for help? Isn't that just walking into a wolf's den? [[168 Selen An angry]]
In the eyes of the demons, this sole heir of the direct line was a fat sheep, both personally and for his political value. Moreover, colluding with the Demon Clan was a direct violation of the bottom line of the creator gods and the Church, which would inevitably lead to being hunted down relentlessly. [[169 Narration neutral]]
In short, the original owner had stepped on every landmine possible, and after doing so, he just died and left this mess for a miserable guy like him to clean up. [[170 Selen An angry]]
If he couldn't handle it, he would have to choose between getting his head cut off or his body run through. [[171 Selen An fearful]]
Just as he was worrying, the moving carriage came to a sudden stop. The immense inertia sent him flying headfirst into the wooden wall of the carriage. [[172 Narration surprised]]
"Thud!" [[173 Narration neutral]]
Selen An was so dizzy he saw stars. Before he could recover and figure out what was happening, the carriage door was opened again. The governess, Mara, reached in from outside, grabbed him, and pulled him out with a forceful "Get over here~". [[174 Narration surprised]]
In his daze, he smelled the strong scent of blood from outside. The smell stimulated his brain, and he instantly sobered up. He saw that the two guards in front of the carriage had fallen into a pool of blood, their eyes wide open in death. [[175 Narration fearful]]
"What..." [[176 Selen An surprised]]
It was the first time Selen An had been so close to death. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest. [[177 Selen An fearful]]
"Master, don't worry about them. These two were spies for the demons. I discovered them and took care of them. The killer behind us is about to catch up, let's go quickly!" [[178 Mara neutral]]
The nun Mara grabbed Selen An's hand and walked forward quickly. The strength in her hand was not something an old nun should possess. The young man turned his head to look at the two guards by the carriage who had died tragically. The pool of blood on the ground stimulated his nerves. [[179 Narration fearful]]
Mara wasn't even bothering to hide her intentions now. Seeing that they had arrived at Craigmore, the demon's rendezvous point, she couldn't hold back any longer. She killed the two guards and dragged her mission target away. [[180 Narration neutral]]
And Selen An, knowing Mara's true identity and what he was about to face, did not dare to resist. He just let Mara drag him forward. The bloody scene replayed in his mind, as if warning him... [[181 Narration fearful]]
If he acted impulsively, that would be his fate! [[182 Selen An fearful]]
