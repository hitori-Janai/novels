Chapter 3: Reset 3: Is the Cheat Here? [[114 旁白 neutral]]
    No sooner said than done, a golden light flashed before his eyes and instantly plunged into his glabella. [[115 旁白 neutral]]
    In an instant, the oppressive aura around his body finally dissipated, revealing itself. Nine... nine o'clock and still daydreaming? Any netizen next door would probably pour some strong liquor to sober him up. [[116 旁白 neutral]]
    The imagined cheat finger did not arrive, nor was there the familiar "ding" sound of traditional web novels. The golden light merely condensed before his eyes, finally manifesting as a golden virtual panel suspended in mid-air. [[117 旁白 neutral]]
    Text appeared on the panel: [[118 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[119 旁白 neutral]]

    Race: Human (Semi-Succubus) [[122 旁白 neutral]]
    Class: Profligate Scion [[123 旁白 neutral]]
    Level: Rookie Warrior [[124 旁白 neutral]]
    Attributes: (Average level for ordinary people is D+) [[125 旁白 neutral]]

    Class Skills: [[132 旁白 neutral]]
    Greed for Life and Fear of Death (Endurance slightly increased) [A fixed personality trait for villainous male supporting characters. Better endurance helps you live longer. When facing danger, your will to survive will be far higher than others, and your chance of successfully begging for mercy will be higher than average.] [[133 旁白 neutral]]
    Arrogant and Overbearing (Recovery significantly increased) [As a noble, you naturally believe you are superior to commoners. Look at people with your nostrils; this is the arrogance of a noble!] [[134 旁白 neutral]]
    Treasures: [[135 旁白 neutral]]
    Sword of Peace (Unsealed) [Proof of the Water God's agent, symbolizing peace, never sharpened. "A sword without an edge, for true peace needs no slaughter" —engraved on the hilt is the First Saintess's tear-shaped Water God's eye.] [[136 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[137 旁白 neutral]]
    Although he had long known that the original owner of this body was a good-for-nothing whose body had been hollowed out by beauties, and whose stats would be garbage, he still secretly felt a little excited in his heart the moment the panel appeared. [[138 塞伦安 neutral]]
    What if? What if he was favored by the Goddess of Luck? [[139 塞伦安 neutral]]
    With a mindset similar to opening a blind box, he read through all the data on the panel, then expressionlessly averted his gaze. [[140 旁白 neutral]]
    He admitted he was a glutton. Even though he knew it was crap, he still felt rebellious and tasted it himself. [[141 塞伦安 angry]]
    Damn it! [[142 塞伦安 angry]]
    Could this panel data be any more ridiculous?! [[143 塞伦安 angry]]
    Putting aside the "semi-succubus" tag under race, just looking at those stats, at first glance, one might think there were some noteworthy points, but the crucial stats were all D. What did such high endurance and recovery mean? [[144 塞伦安 angry]]
    In other games, this might be a highlight, but this was an adult game world. In the后续 plot, he would even become a female Succubus. High endurance and recovery, to put it simply in two words, didn't that clearly mean he was "enduring"?! [[145 塞伦安 angry]]
    And this skill, Marksmanship, seemed fine at first glance. But on second thought, the original owner of this body was a direct descendant inheriting the purest bloodline of the Water Saintess. [[146 旁白 neutral]]
    In the Niflheim Continent, all Saintesses followed the most orthodox mage path. Damn, his ancestor was a top-tier mage, and they wanted him, a descendant, to play with crossbows? [[147 塞伦安 angry]]
    Not being a mage, but an archer? [[148 塞伦安 angry]]
    This was simply rebellious and disloyal! [[149 塞伦安 angry]]
    To fill this character's panel with such mismatched things, the stats planner must have been utterly incompetent. [[150 塞伦安 angry]]
    But this wasn't the most outrageous part. Compared to the classes below, it was merely a drop in the ocean. [[151 旁白 neutral]]
    If they didn't want to give class skills, they didn't have to, but could "Greed for Life and Fear of Death" and "Arrogant and Overbearing," these derogatory idioms, also be used as filler skills? [[152 塞伦安 angry]]
    Look at these skill descriptions, especially "Arrogant and Overbearing." Did they want this profligate young master to die even faster? [[153 塞伦安 angry]]
    And looking at people with his nostrils? If he dared to look at the old nun outside the carriage with his nostrils now, he'd probably be crawling on the ground like a dog for her in a few days. [[154 塞伦安 angry]]
    He was already annoyed enough after reading all this, but the final treasure really made him laugh out of anger. [[155 塞伦安 angry]]
    He had thought that even if the attribute skills were unreliable, a genuine treasure might at least be useful, right? [[156 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Sword of Peace, because it symbolized peace, was never sharpened. Heh, heh... [[157 塞伦安 sad]]
    Not to mention no special bonuses, this unsharpened blunt sword was completely useless, not even as good as a farmer's hoe by the roadside! [[158 塞伦安 angry]]
    In short, looking at the entire panel, it summed up to two words—despair. [[159 塞伦安 sad]]
    It was so utterly despairing; there was nothing useful at all. [[160 塞伦安 sad]]
    The only seemingly useful skill, "Marksmanship," he didn't even have any ranged weapons on him. This was like a swordsman without a sword, fighting empty-handed and powerless. [[161 塞伦安 sad]]
    In this situation, it seemed that besides suddenly awakening his bloodline, he could only pray for a miracle from the Water God, whom his family had worshipped for generations. [[162 塞伦安 sad]]
    However, as everyone knew, among the six creation gods, the Water God was the only one in a deep slumber, without any reason. This was also why he, who blasphemed the Water God's faith, was being pursued by the Ice God. [[163 旁白 neutral]]
    Because in mythology, the Water God, symbolizing peace, and the Ice God, symbolizing judgment, were sisters. He was hated by a certain sister-complex god! [[164 塞伦安 fearful]]
    He was going to die! [[165 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Selen An couldn't help but curse the original owner of this body for being so reckless. If he had just stayed safely in the large family, not causing trouble, the family would have provided him with good food and drink due to his bloodline and status, and his only task would have been to be a competent stud, propagating the direct lineage. His life would have been carefree. But now? [[166 塞伦安 angry]]
    Craving some so-called power, wanting to awaken his bloodline. [[167 旁白 neutral]]
    Please, it's good to be ambitious, but can't you use your brain? To seek help from the Demon Clan, wasn't that just throwing himself into a wolf's den? [[168 塞伦安 angry]]
    In the eyes of the Demon Clan, he, the sole direct descendant, was practically a fat sheep, both himself and his political value. Moreover, once he colluded with the Demon Clan, it would almost certainly cross the bottom line of the creation gods and the Church, leading to relentless pursuit until death. [[169 旁白 fearful]]
    In short, the original owner had stepped on every possible landmine. After stepping on them, he tilted his head, exhaled his last breath, and it was left to him, the poor unfortunate soul, to clean up the mess. [[170 旁白 neutral]]
    If he couldn't handle it well, he would only have to choose between "decapitation" and "body penetration." [[171 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Just as he was agonizing, the moving carriage suddenly came to a screeching halt. The immense inertia sent him crashing headfirst into the wooden wall of the carriage. [[172 旁白 neutral]]
    “Thud!” [[173 旁白 neutral]]
    Selen An was almost dizzy from the impact. Before he could recover and understand the situation, the carriage door opened again. Mara, the governess-nun, reached out from outside and, with a simple "Come~ here~," dragged him out. [[174 旁白 neutral]]
    Amidst his dizziness, he smelled the strong scent of blood outside. The bloody smell stimulated his brain, instantly clearing it. He saw the two men dressed as guards in front of the carriage lying in pools of blood, their eyes wide open in death. [[175 旁白 fearful]]
    “This...” [[176 塞伦安 fearful]]
    It was Selen An's first time experiencing death up close, and he felt his heart pounding in his chest. [[177 塞伦安 fearful]]
    “Young Master, don’t mind them. They were demon spies, discovered and secretly dealt with by me. That killer behind us is catching up; let's go quickly!” [[178 玛拉 neutral]]
    Mara, the nun, pulled Selen An forward with brisk steps. Her immense strength was not something an old nun should possess. The young man turned his head to look at the two guards by the carriage, whose deaths were gruesome. The pooling blood on the ground stimulated his nerves. [[179 旁白 fearful]]
    Mara was now completely unrestrained. Seeing that they had reached Craigmore, the demon rendezvous point, she could no longer hold back. She casually killed the two guards and dragged her target away. [[180 旁白 neutral]]
    Selen An, who knew Mara's true identity and what he was about to face, dared not resist at all. He merely let Mara drag him forward. The bloody scene kept replaying in his mind, as if warning him... [[181 旁白 fearful]]
    If he acted impulsively, that would be his fate! [[182 旁白 fearful]]
