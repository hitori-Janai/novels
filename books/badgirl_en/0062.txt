Chapter 62: The Violent Priest [[3518 旁白 neutral]]
    "Five..." [[3519 旁白 neutral]]
    "Four..." [[3520 旁白 neutral]]
    In the pitch-black darkness where one couldn't see their hand in front of their face, flowing shadows like oil surging from the ground gradually encroached upon every inch of the wooden floorboards that covered the room. [[3521 旁白 fearful]]
    "Three..." [[3522 旁白 neutral]]
    "Two..." [[3523 旁白 neutral]]
    The scent, a mixture of fresh flowers and rotting corpses, grew thicker and thicker. As he counted down to two in his mind, that unusual smell was almost pressed against his cheek, and foul-smelling saliva dripped onto his shoulder. [[3524 旁白 fearful]]
    "One..." [[3525 旁白 neutral]]
    "Zero!" [[3526 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre suddenly opened his eyes, and a brilliant holy light, like a blazing sun, pierced through the covers, fully blooming in the enclosed room. [[3527 旁白 surprised]]
    [Basic Holy Light Art] [[3528 旁白 neutral]]
    This sudden change left the monsters hidden in the room's darkness with nowhere to hide. The brilliant holy light mercilessly tore through their camouflage. As the dazzling white light touched their true forms, the sizzling sound of white smoke mixed with hoarse screams instantly shattered the night's tranquility. [[3529 旁白 fearful]]
    "Ugh! Damn Holy Light, we've been tricked!" [[3530 陌生男1 angry]]
    The three vampires, forced to reveal themselves in the darkness, clutched their eyes in pain, their bodies contorting. [[3531 旁白 fearful]]
    At the same time, the man's muscles under the sheet suddenly tensed, his pure yang blood boiling in his veins like magma. When the second drop of foul-smelling saliva landed on his pillow, he sprang up like a coiled spring, and a silver glint cut through the darkness. [[3532 旁白 neutral]]
    With the brief illumination from the holy light, he instantly caught sight of the three figures in the room, as well as the other two rotten-smelling figures guarding outside the door who hadn't been greatly affected. [[3533 旁白 neutral]]
    There were five targets visible to the naked eye. The one closest to him had its face pressed against the headboard. At the moment the holy light bloomed, it was affected the most; white smoke seeped from its eye sockets as if its eyeballs had been completely burned away in that instant of white light. [[3534 旁白 fearful]]
    Andre pulled the trigger with one hand, the muzzle pressed accurately against the forehead of this most unlucky vampire. The silver bullet, engraved with thorn patterns, spun through its brow, and the holy water-soaked bullet exploded with holy light inside its skull. [[3535 旁白 neutral]]
    The booming gunshot signaled the start of the battle. The moment the two sides clashed, Andre, with the force of thunder, instantly killed one of the vampires. [[3536 旁白 neutral]]
    Under the quadruple叠加 of Holy Light Art + Silver Killer + Demon Hunting Bullet + High-Grade Holy Water, even vampires, rumored to be immortal, had no chance of "getting back up" again. [[3537 旁白 neutral]]
    The bullet passed through the brow, and the monster's brain exploded like a melon. [[3538 旁白 neutral]]
    The silver bullet spun, tearing through pale flesh, and the skull cracked open with spiderweb-like fissures. Gray-green brain matter, mixed with bone fragments, splattered out radially. Black blood burst like overripe berries, and a few drops of foul-smelling fluid splashed onto the wooden floor, instantly corroding honeycomb-like holes. The residual holy water in the cranial cavity sizzled, evaporating dark red blood mist. [[3539 旁白 neutral]]
    Witnessing such a bloody scene tonight did not make Andre flinch in the slightest. The highly corrosive blood, as it approached him, was instantly neutralized by the gleaming pure white stole worn under his white coat. [[3540 旁白 neutral]]
    "He killed Gulpo, that bastard! Kill him quickly!" [[3541 陌生男2 angry]]
    After all, Holy Light Art was the most basic magic, its effect lasting almost only an instant. As the light faded, the vampires who had not been heavily affected by the holy light recovered from their previous surprise attack and angry shouts immediately rose. [[3542 旁白 angry]]
    Four bloody pupils suddenly lit up in the four corners of the room, and decaying bat wings stirred a foul wind. The small room instantly felt like it was hit by a Category 10 hurricane, and the wooden walls and furniture let out an unbearable "creaking" wail. [[3543 旁白 fearful]]
    Facing two such terrifying auras, with two unknown enemy companions still guarding outside the door, Andre did not hesitate for a moment. Under the additional blessing of [Accurate Shot MAX], his iron sight was locked onto the center of the second vampire's head as if it were on a rail. His index finger pulled the trigger, the cylinder rotated, and the silver muzzle flash roared as it was spat out. [[3544 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre was confident that none of his bullets would miss, but the vampires opposite him were not fixed targets. Without the initial blinding effect of the holy light, the flight speed of the bullets was indeed slowed down to a reactive pace in their enhanced bloodshot eyes. [[3545 旁白 neutral]]
    Their monstrous bodies allowed them to react immediately, unlike humans, whose minds might keep up but their bodies couldn't. [[3546 旁白 neutral]]
    "Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...!" [[3547 旁白 neutral]]
    Six consecutive gunshots rang out. The fired bullets were either dodged or deflected by the bat wings unfurled behind the vampires. Although the bullets only grazed the bat wings, tearing a series of large holes in their thin flesh, as long as they didn't hit fatal spots like the head or heart, the bone-burning pain only further ignited the vampires' ferocity. [[3548 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre's "Silver Killer" twin guns were classic six-shot revolvers. After a round of combat, more than half of the ammunition in the cylinders was gone. Besides the first unlucky one at the beginning, he hadn't caused any fatal severe injuries to any other vampire yet. [[3549 旁白 neutral]]
    The vampires clearly realized this. Taking advantage of Andre's ammunition shortage, they rapidly advanced with their agile movements. Bloody light tore through the depths of the night, bringing with it a man-eating stench. [[3550 旁白 neutral]]
    "Bang, bang, bang...!" [[3551 旁白 neutral]]
    Another continuous volley of fire, until the muzzles of the silver twin guns smoked white, no longer able to spit out their holy flames. [[3552 旁白 neutral]]
    The first four bullets were dodged by the two vampires in the same manner. At the moment the last silver bullet pierced through a gap in a bat wing, Andre's wrist twitched slightly, and the bullet's trajectory suddenly curved strangely. [[3553 旁白 neutral]]
    The young vampire's face still held a fanged, cruel grin, but his left eye socket suddenly bloomed with a silver lotus-like vortex of brain matter. The spinning bullet even accelerated a second time during its flight, causing his entire head to snap back ninety degrees as it penetrated his skull. [[3554 旁白 neutral]]
    Another one was taken down, but the surviving vampire had already closed in, its crimson eyes full of a thirst for blood. [[3555 旁白 neutral]]
    All the bullets in the Silver Killer were spent. Reloading was clearly too late. The last vampire's face also revealed a triumphant, cruel grin. Without the ranged suppression of firearms, fighting a vampire in close quarters in such a small room was no different from seeking death. [[3556 旁白 neutral]]
    The reflection of the undead monster was in the man's poet-green eyes. Clearly, he knew this truth as well. [[3557 旁白 neutral]]
    As the foul-smelling blood rain scattered, Andre crossed his arms and swung them. The two silver guns slid down to his waist with the force, replaced by silver-white gun-swords that sprang from his coat sleeves. [[3558 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre's white-gloved hands naturally grasped the hilt of the sliding gun-swords. The blades, carved with exorcism runes, shimmered with a mercury-like sheen, and the holy crystals embedded in the guards hummed with a hungry sound. [[3559 旁白 neutral]]
    "Clang!" [[3560 旁白 neutral]]
    It was the shrill sound of the vampire's claws colliding with the priest's gun-sword. The vampire stared incredulously at the priest before him; he had actually withstood its charge head-on. This guy's strength was terrifying, like a monster. [[3561 旁白 surprised]]
    "Had enough? If you have, then try this!" [[3562 旁白 angry]]
    The man's eyes were filled with coldness. The knotted muscles in his arms suddenly exerted force, forcing open the vampire's claws. The friction between the claws and the metal gun-sword sparked. [[3563 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre spun to avoid the renewed blood claw attack. The gun-sword grazed the vampire's wrist, and blue runes lit up on the blade the moment it touched the corrupted blood. The vampire's entire arm suddenly exploded from within, and moon-white thorns rapidly grew from its flesh, coiling like living snakes around the vampire's neck. [[3564 旁白 fearful]]
    The dying vampire frantically tore at its windpipe in agony. Andre seized the opportunity and thrust a gun-sword into its gaping mouth. [[3565 旁白 neutral]]
    The moment the blade pierced through the back of its head and nailed it to the wall, another gun-sword also entered through one of the vampire's temples, its tip emerging from the other side. [[3566 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre released the hilts and slowly stepped back, revealing the two gun-swords firmly stuck in the vampire's head, forming a perfect upright cross. [[3567 旁白 neutral]]
    The man lifted a corner of his greatcoat and pulled out a test tube filled with high-grade holy water from his pocket. With a "pop" as the cork was flicked open with his thumb, the pure holy water poured onto the vampire's corpse, automatically igniting a purifying white holy flame. [[3568 旁白 neutral]]
    Watching the vampire's corpse, even its skeleton, completely melt away in the white flames, he retrieved his gun-swords from the wall. The slight breeze created by his movement scattered the remaining ashes after the holy fire's purification. [[3569 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre pushed open the large door. The two figures who had been guarding outside were now lifeless, but downstairs, it seemed more restless monsters had been unleashed. [[3570 旁白 neutral]]
    The man looked up at the full moon in the sky, his eyes devoid of sadness or joy. [[3571 旁白 neutral]]
    Because he knew... tonight's battle had only just begun. [[3572 旁白 neutral]]
