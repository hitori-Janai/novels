Chapter 66 I Am Your Highness's Dog [[3727 旁白 neutral]]
    The pain of his limbs being cut felt as if it would tear his soul apart. The demon-hunting bullets pierced and tore his wounds, feeling more like a red-hot branding iron shoved into his abdomen. The high temperature constantly burned and roasted his flesh, allowing it to grow back only to destroy it again, repeating an endless torture. [[3728 旁白 fearful]]
    Even in a coma, the torment, like death by a thousand cuts, didn't spare him. Every inch of his skin felt as if it was constantly being lashed by thorned branches soaked in saltwater. The heart-wrenching pain prevented him from ever falling completely numb, thus denying him even a moment of peace... [[3729 旁白 fearful]]
    To him, death felt like heaven, while living was an endless hell. Yet, this agonizing moment came to an abrupt halt at some point. [[3730 旁白 neutral]]
    His mouth was violently pried open by someone. Following that, a warm liquid was poured into his mouth. The sweet taste stimulated his gradually recovering taste buds, and his consciousness, numbed by the boundless pain, slowly awakened under the nourishment of what felt like divine nectar. [[3731 旁白 neutral]]
    The fresh blood revived this withered and decaying body. [[3732 旁白 neutral]]
    "Drip—drop—" [[3733 旁白 neutral]]
    The sound was like a beautiful note played when blood spurted from the neck wound of prey and dripped onto the ground. [[3734 旁白 neutral]]
    Sasha opened his eyes. The vision before him gradually sharpened from a blur. This looked like a dungeon, small, dark, and damp. This was nothing to a blood race; they were naturally good at living in such environments. In fact, arriving here gave Sasha, who had just suffered a terrible torture, a slight sense of peace. [[3735 旁白 neutral]]
    "It seems you're awake~" [[3736 魅魔 neutral]]
    A soft, exceedingly charming voice instantly captured all his attention. Sasha twisted slightly and saw a petite human female crouching beside him... [[3737 旁白 neutral]]
    No! [[3738 旁白 surprised]]
    With just one more glance, Sasha's eyes were completely fixated. [[3739 旁白 neutral]]
    That was not a human female, but a genuine succubus. [[3740 旁白 surprised]]
    "You are..." [[3741 撒夏 neutral]]
    Perhaps it was due to just waking up, or perhaps the mental pain suffered during his coma was too severe. Even with the nourishment of high-quality blood, his voice was still somewhat weak. [[3742 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh my, oh my~ Are Duke Vlad's little pawns so lacking in discernment now?" [[3743 魅魔 angry]]
    The succubus with pale hair and pink heart-shaped pupils crouched, resting her small hands on her chin, a playful and joyful smile filling her bewitching face. [[3744 旁白 neutral]]
    Such an arrogant tone, seemingly not putting the great Duke in her eyes at all. Sasha, deeply influenced by family control and his bloodline, instinctively wanted to sternly question her, disregarding his own predicament, but after clearly seeing her appearance, he trembled all over. [[3745 旁白 fearful]]
    Pale long hair, pink heart-shaped pupils, dark goat horns, and matching heart-shaped tail and small demon wings behind her—these features, without exception, only existed on high-ranking succubi, and this succubus lady had them all! [[3746 旁白 surprised]]
    Without a doubt, even if her aura wasn't strong, this succubus lady before him was definitely a big shot that a mere blood race like him couldn't offend. In the demon realm, her mother could even be a clan leader on equal footing with the great Duke Vlad! [[3747 旁白 fearful]]
    "L-lady..." [[3748 撒夏 fearful]]
    Sasha swallowed back the rebuke that had already reached his lips and called out humbly, his voice indistinct. [[3749 旁白 neutral]]
    "Heh, it seems you're not completely stupid after all~ This Princess thought all you long-fanged creatures, who only know how to gnaw on necks all day, only had a craving for blood left in your brains~" [[3750 魅魔 neutral]]
    The white-haired succubus stood up, stretching her graceful figure lazily. Under Sasha's night vision, her unintentional movements, every slight change in action, seemed like the most alluring temptation in the world, making one's blood surge uncontrollably. [[3751 旁白 neutral]]
    At the same time, he also noticed the key information unintentionally revealed in her words. [[3752 旁白 neutral]]
    "This Princess" and "long-fanged creatures" — the former was a self-address only held by those of noble status like princesses and princes, while the latter was a completely derogatory nickname for the blood race. Hearing this, Sasha felt no shame from being insulted; instead, it further solidified his recent guess. [[3753 旁白 neutral]]
    This seemingly not-so-strong succubus lady was most likely the daughter of the current Succubus Queen, one of the most noble identities in the entire demon race. Only a succubus princess would dare to call them "long-fanged creatures" so brazenly in front of a blood race. [[3754 旁白 neutral]]
    In conclusion, he, a lowly baron, had actually seen the Princess of the Succubus race with his own eyes! [[3755 旁白 surprised]]
    Thinking of this, Sasha instinctively lowered his guard. Although the other party was not of the same blood race as himself, both the blood race and the succubus race belonged to the greater demon race. [[3756 旁白 neutral]]
    There was a saying in the demon realm: "A great demon doesn't cheat a great demon." [[3757 旁白 neutral]]
    This was one of their own, no problem! [[3758 旁白 happy]]
    Just as Sasha was about to say something to express his noble respect, an unbearable itch suddenly came from his lower body. He looked down and saw large patches of blood sprouts and blood vessels extending outward from the wound, rapidly weaving and reshaping his legs at a visible speed. [[3759 旁白 surprised]]
    Such an astonishing healing speed was completely inconsistent with his current weakened physical state. Combined with the inexplicably high-quality blood that flowed into his mouth before waking up, Sasha trembled again. Without waiting for his lower body to fully heal, he completely knelt and prostrated himself on the damp ground. [[3760 旁白 surprised]]
    "Thank you, Your Highness, for the grace of the blood! Thank you, Your Highness, for the grace of the blood!" [[3761 撒夏 happy]]
    He could clearly feel that his weak body was not only recovering quickly, but deep within his flesh, a pure power was continuously cleansing his mottled bloodline! [[3762 旁白 surprised]]
    Bloodline, to the blood race, was undoubtedly a second life. A blood race with a high bloodline could even ignore the restraints of mithril and sunlight. If he possessed a more noble bloodline, he would not have lost the battle against that priest! [[3763 旁白 neutral]]
    There were only two possibilities to elevate one's bloodline. One was the blood-snatching battle among the blood race, where through ancient rituals and agreements, a duel from lower to higher ranks could be initiated. The victor would seize the stronger one's original blood, thus becoming a more noble and powerful blood noble. [[3764 旁白 neutral]]
    The defeated blood nobles usually met a tragic end; either their strength plummeted, completely becoming pawns for high-ranking blood races to toy with, or their bloodline directly ran wild, degenerating into the dirtiest, most humble ghouls. [[3765 旁白 neutral]]
    Clearly, this path carried great risks, and many blood races forever remained stagnant due to their fear of the consequences of defeat. [[3766 旁白 neutral]]
    The second method was much easier: by consuming higher-quality blood, the bloodline of the blood race would be cleansed and transformed. Such high-quality blood was not limited to the blood race; elves, orcs, and winged folk who possessed rich magic power or even a certain amount of divine blood in their bodies could also provide it. [[3767 旁白 neutral]]
    The direct bestowal of fresh blood by a superior was respectfully called "blood bestowal" by the first-generation students. This grace, in the eyes of the blood race who received it, was no different from being reborn. [[3768 旁白 neutral]]
    Because of this, Sasha knelt directly before the other party without a second thought. [[3769 旁白 neutral]]
    He never dreamed that encountering that blond priest was the worst luck of his life, and he feared his life would be lost in this nameless small town. Yet, he never expected that the arrival of misfortune also heralded the greatest "benefactor" of his life. [[3770 旁白 happy]]
    "Heh heh, I merely bestowed a little of my blood, and look how happy you are. You look less like a blood race now and more like a dog wagging its tail to please me after getting some meat~" [[3771 魅魔 neutral]]
    The pink-eyed succubus watched this scene, and a sense of joyful manipulation of others' fates arose in her heart. She squatted down, reached out, and stroked Sasha's hair, her enchanting face displaying a playful expression as casual as if she were stroking her own pet dog. [[3772 旁白 neutral]]
    "Yes, Your Highness, yes, Your Highness, I will be your dog from now on! Your Highness's most loyal dog!" [[3773 撒夏 happy]]
    Absurd words echoed in the dungeon. Sasha, who once prided himself as a noble, had no noble dignity left; his words only conveyed an urgent desire to cling to the demon princess. [[3774 旁白 neutral]]
    He, Sasha, truly wanted to improve! [[3775 旁白 neutral]]
