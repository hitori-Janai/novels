Chapter 105: Wolf King Steelbone [[6217 旁白 neutral]]
    "That's right, now that's more like it~" [[6218 卡耶塔纳 happy]]
    "Show your true form, display the elegance you, as a descendant of a witch, should have, prove your worth, and then perish in pain!" [[6219 卡耶塔纳 angry]]
    Cayetana watched the bursting starlight. In her scarlet eyes, there was no fear or hesitation, only the exhilaration of reuniting with her "nemesis." [[6220 旁白 neutral]]
    Surrounded by thousands of starlight, Medea, restored to youth, opened her wine-red eyes. Her pure white priestess robe melted in the light, then rewove into a witch's robe, weaving through the starlight branches. [[6221 旁白 neutral]]
    She raised the holy silver scepter in her hand. The dazzling holy silver scepter also peeled away under the brighter light, revealing rough tree bark. The ancient wooden scepter was carved with the marks of time; though not as sacred as holy silver, it was the legendary witch's exclusive staff. [[6222 旁白 neutral]]
    Looking at Grandma Priestess, who seemed reborn from fire in the light, Lobelia couldn't help but genuinely admire the beauty of the witch lineage. [[6223 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
    No wonder in the bards' tales, witches and sorceresses are always described as enchanting beings and femme fatales. With her vibrant, fiery red hair, Medea was like the only red rose blooming at night; under the night sky, her beauty and fragrance were unrivaled. [[6224 旁白 neutral]]
    So, this is what Grandma Priestess looked like when she was young? [[6225 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    While Lobelia was momentarily stunned, the battle on the other side had already begun. [[6226 旁白 neutral]]
    Clearly, the secret art of restoring to peak condition using starlight had a time limit. After Medea, having regained her youth, finished her not-so-short "cutscene," she wasted no words. Countless star-lines swirled around her, and her figure transformed into the legendary, mysterious, and magnificent Star Spirit. [[6227 旁白 neutral]]
    Countless streams of light fell from the sky, beginning a thorough, all-encompassing "cleansing" towards Cayetana's location. Amidst continuous roars and flying dust, this ancient town, after a millennium, once again welcomed an earth-shaking transformation. [[6228 旁白 neutral]]
    Having seemingly seen the familiar appearance of her old nemesis, Cayetana, who had previously shown little interest in Medea, the witch's descendant, perked up. She decisively cut her own skin, allowing crimson blood to flow... [[6229 旁白 neutral]]
    This blood, exposed to the air, did not drip to the ground due to gravity. The blood, infused with magic, quickly solidified and existed as non-scab-like crystals. [[6230 旁白 neutral]]
    Her blood condensed into sharp, prismatic blades, arranged in sequence, overlapping and floating around her lower body like a second skirt, cold and elegant. [[6231 旁白 neutral]]
    The backless design of her Gothic dress conveniently allowed her to unfurl her demonic wings. A terrifying aura made the ground she stood on crack. She gazed at her millennium-old nemesis in the sky, her eyes filled only with a thirst for battle and slaughter. [[6232 旁白 neutral]]
    "Let's fight!" [[6233 卡耶塔纳 angry]]
    She declared loudly. With a wave of her sleeve, the swirling air currents tore another monstrous gash in the ground. [[6234 旁白 neutral]]
    Their clash was like colliding meteors. The blood-red moon and the dazzling comet moved at extreme speeds, with continuous sonic booms; each collision was a test of eardrum endurance. [[6235 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing that Grandma Medea had successfully entangled Cayetana, Lobelia lightly tapped her toes, wanting to leave the starlight barrier and go support the Wind Saintess. [[6236 旁白 neutral]]
    As soon as she flew into the air, she heard two "swish" sounds. Three or four red streams of light grazed the girl's cheek, then exploded into countless tiny blood crystals upon touching the ground. [[6237 旁白 fearful]]
    The girl, who had hastily stopped her journey, slightly furrowed her brows. [[6238 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    As expected, it's still a bit difficult, isn't it? [[6239 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Even if Grandma Medea regained her youth and seemed to entangle Cayetana, how could a sixth-tier bloodline be stopped by a fifth-tier one? [[6240 旁白 neutral]]
    While they fought, she could still spare attention to intercept her, clearly not letting her leave. Forcing her way out would be too risky. [[6241 旁白 fearful]]
    Should I use the [Non-Aggression Pact]? [[6242 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    No, it's clearly not the time yet. Using it early would only put me in a helpless situation without any trump cards. [[6243 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    So, I can only try that skill? [[6244 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    As the girl hesitated with divided attention, the battle in the sky grew fiercer... [[6245 旁白 neutral]]
    Just as the comet and blood moon were about to collide again, the magic enveloping both of them exploded simultaneously. Without the protection of magic, their flesh became the first line of defense. [[6246 旁白 neutral]]
    Cayetana's demonic wings suddenly folded like blades! She allowed the starlight chains to pierce her left shoulder, while also locking onto her opponent, smashing towards the ground like a cannonball, using the impact force. [[6247 旁白 neutral]]
    "Boom!" [[6248 旁白 neutral]]
    In the center of the collapsing square, a somewhat disheveled Medea, who had just gotten up, had not yet fully unfolded her star array when the bloodline girl tore through the dust and charged within three steps. [[6249 旁白 neutral]]
    Her blood-stained skirt transformed into a deadly weapon at this moment. The floating blood crystal blades rained down towards the witch's throat. Medea was forced to condense the automatically attacking star-tracks around her into layered magic shields. The light shields and blood crystals collided, emitting a harsh wail. [[6250 旁白 neutral]]
    "Crack!" [[6251 旁白 neutral]]
    The light shield shattered, and the sharp blood crystals successfully penetrated Medea's close defense. Just as these arrow-like blood crystals were about to pierce the woman's chest, a pure white coffin engraved with a cross suddenly blocked her way. [[6252 旁白 surprised]]
    The blood crystals, which could pierce magic, shattered upon colliding with the coffin lid. Cayetana, who had been pressing her attack, was slightly surprised. Instead of immediately taking the witch's life, she was more curious: what was this white coffin that had suddenly appeared? [[6253 旁白 surprised]]
    Especially the aura emanating from this coffin made her feel both familiar and disgusted. It was familiar because it had a strong wolf scent, and she disliked it for the same reason. [[6254 旁白 neutral]]
    This smell instantly reminded her of the night she was sealed a millennium ago: the red-haired witch and the bipedal Wolf King with a body of steel. [[6255 旁白 neutral]]
    Meanwhile, Lobelia, who had just been preparing to act from the side, was completely stunned. Cayetana didn't recognize this coffin, but she did! [[6256 旁白 surprised]]
    Isn't this Master's coffin? [[6257 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
    Back then, it was Andrew who personally presided over the burial ceremony, and he even personally shovelled the first handful of soil into the grave. [[6258 旁白 neutral]]
    So, Grandma Priestess dug up Master's coffin? [[6259 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
    But this question didn't last long; Medea soon personally resolved it— [[6260 旁白 neutral]]
    Taking advantage of everyone's stunned state, she turned and slammed her palm heavily on one side of the coffin. Immediately, with the whirring of dense mechanical gears, the rectangular coffin opened outwards diagonally on both sides, revealing an array of ice-cold, radiant weapons. [[6261 旁白 neutral]]
    That hateful aura grew even stronger; at this point, it wasn't just dislike, but an instinctive reaction. [[6262 旁白 fearful]]
    Cayetana gazed at the peculiarly shaped coffin, which resembled a sword case, and coldly uttered a few words, narrowing her eyes. [[6263 卡耶塔纳 neutral]]
    "Wolf King Steelbone." [[6264 卡耶塔纳 neutral]]
