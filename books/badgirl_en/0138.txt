Chapter 138: Companionship [[8788 旁白 neutral]]
"So, Miss Windsor, are you also planning to go to Giant Rock City?" [[8789 塞伦安 neutral]]
Inside the carriage, Selen An and the newly acquainted Windsor sat opposite each other, conversing. [[8790 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes, my destination is also Giant Rock City." [[8791 陌生女1 neutral]]
The silver-haired Moon Elf sat gracefully on one side of the carriage, her hands folded on her lap, looking very much like a well-bred lady. [[8792 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh, it seems this is indeed fate. Sera and I are also planning to go to Giant Rock City." [[8793 塞伦安 happy]]
"Actually, I've always been curious, since both of you are clergy serving the God of Wind, why would you leave the land of the Wind God and come to the land of the Rock God?" [[8794 陌生女1 neutral]]
Windsor showed a puzzled expression. [[8795 旁白 neutral]]
She couldn't understand. Priests and nuns should stay in their own churches, spreading the gospel of their faith and serving their deity. It was very rare for them to suddenly go to another deity's territory. [[8796 旁白 neutral]]
"Because I've stayed in Windermere for too long. I feel that staying in one place for too long loses the concept of freedom. Besides, although the Ainwell territory is protected by the God of Rock, it doesn't guarantee that the entire land is full of Rock God believers..." [[8797 塞伦安 neutral]]
"The free wind will blow across every land. I believe that even in a foreign land, there will still be devout believers returning to the great Wind God!" [[8798 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An's passionate speech completely convinced Windsor. [[8799 旁白 neutral]]
For some reason, normally, if others had said the same thing, the silver-haired elf lady would most likely still calmly assess the truth of those words, at least not believe them immediately as she did now. [[8800 旁白 neutral]]
Facing Selen An, this unfamiliar priest whom she had never met, Windsor always felt an inexplicable closeness. [[8801 旁白 neutral]]
This was also the main reason she had intervened multiple times before. With the kind nature of elves, encountering evildoers would naturally lead to intervention, but that was usually it. Normally, Windsor would have shot an arrow from a tree branch, hitting the evildoer's arm, and then disappeared stealthily before the rescued person even realized it. [[8802 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, she didn't. Because of that inexplicable feeling in her heart, she chose to come down from the tree and interact with this young priest whom she had never met. Now, things had progressed to the point where she was traveling with them. [[8803 旁白 neutral]]
[Wendini, oh Wendini, what is wrong with you? Finding the Saintess is the top priority, so why are you getting sidetracked at this critical juncture?] [[8804 温蒂尼 sad]]
She constantly questioned herself in her heart, but even stranger, the elf's clear and flawless mind didn't feel even a trace of regret. [[8805 旁白 neutral]]
This surprised her greatly. In other words, making this choice was not a momentary impulsive mistake, but a truly heartfelt and "correct" decision. [[8806 旁白 neutral]]
The objective correctness and subjective correctness conflicted, causing Wendini to experience this unique kind of distress for the first time. [[8807 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way, Miss Windsor, as an elf, are you going to Giant Rock City to admire the exotic scenery, or do you have other important matters to attend to?" [[8808 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man's voice pulled her thoughts back. [[8809 旁白 neutral]]
"I..." [[8810 陌生女1 neutral]]
"If it's inconvenient to answer, you don't have to force yourself." [[8811 塞伦安 neutral]]
"No, if it's Mr. Andrew, I trust your noble character and won't feel pressured." [[8812 陌生女1 neutral]]
Wendini waved her hand quickly, as if she couldn't refuse any of Selen An's requests. [[8813 旁白 neutral]]
"Actually, I'm going into the city this time to find someone, someone very important to me." [[8814 陌生女1 neutral]]
Although emotion and logic were clashing, elves are naturally emotional creatures. After much thought, Wendini decided to trust her intuition and this young priest who gave her a special feeling. [[8815 旁白 neutral]]
Besides, finding someone naturally benefited from more hands. If it weren't for the safety of her race, the Elf Queen would naturally send a large number of people to search everywhere. [[8816 旁白 neutral]]
Even if the scope was now narrowed down to Giant Rock City, it was still a vast city, and the probability of finding someone in such a large crowd was too small. If someone could help... [[8817 旁白 neutral]]
"Someone very important? Miss Windsor, if you trust me, why not tell me what that person looks like? As a priest certified by the Church, once I reach Giant Rock City, I can ask the Church personnel to keep an eye out for them." [[8818 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man's kind smile further touched Wendini. She found herself increasingly unable to resist this young priest's smile. [[8819 旁白 neutral]]
"Wouldn't that be too much trouble for you?" [[8820 陌生女1 neutral]]
"How could it be? You saved our lives. This small favor is nothing compared to that." [[8821 塞伦安 neutral]]
Just asking these two clergy to keep an eye out shouldn't be a problem, as long as no sensitive information about the Saintess was leaked. [[8822 旁白 neutral]]
After much consideration, Wendini decided to give it a try. [[8823 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm looking for a water-element female mage, with blue hair and blue eyes, a good appearance, and a special aura about her. That's all for now..." [[8824 陌生女1 neutral]]
She didn't mention sensitive information like the Saintess having special teardrop eyes or other obvious symbolic features. This matter involved too much, and even as a princess, she couldn't act completely on her own will. [[8825 旁白 neutral]]
To tell so much to a newly met friend was already her limit. [[8826 旁白 neutral]]
"Is that so?" [[8827 旁白 neutral]]
The young man rubbed his chin, a thoughtful expression on his face, then nodded. [[8828 旁白 neutral]]
"Understood. After we enter the city, I'll help you keep an eye out." [[8829 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Thank you for your benevolence. You are truly a gentleman with a pure soul and noble character." [[8830 陌生女1 neutral]]
Wendini placed one hand on her chest, made a noble gesture, and praised him sincerely. [[8831 旁白 neutral]]
As the two chatted idly in the carriage, outside, their destination, Giant Rock City, was already in sight. [[8832 旁白 neutral]]
Giant Rock City, being a rather famous large city-state, naturally had a large flow of people entering and leaving daily, and the city gate always had long queues. But today, as a special carriage drove in, the people in line all cast their gaze towards it. [[8833 旁白 neutral]]
Seraphina, driving the carriage, pulled the reins. She ignored the curious glances of outsiders, merely glancing at the other person on the carriage seat. The mercenary who had been guiding them along the way immediately understood, extending his hands ingratiatingly, allowing Seraphina to bind him with chains and lead him to the back of the carriage, where an entire mercenary group that had accompanied the carriage was located. [[8834 旁白 neutral]]
All the members of the wandering mercenary group had their hands tightly bound by tough, emerald-green vines, and were lined up one after another. Each person was connected by vines to prevent the formation from breaking or anyone from escaping the main group. [[8835 旁白 neutral]]
All the members of the wandering mercenary group followed dejectedly behind the carriage on foot, and they couldn't walk too slowly, or they would be dragged. [[8836 旁白 neutral]]
This unusual sight not only attracted the attention of ordinary people but also drew the notice of Giant Rock City's city defense forces—a squad of city guards in uniform armor approached with caution. [[8837 旁白 neutral]]
"Who are you? What's in this carriage? And what about those behind the carriage..." [[8838 陌生男1 neutral]]
"They are the wandering mercenary group known as Iron Lion." [[8839 塞伦安 neutral]]
A young man's voice suddenly interjected. The leading squad captain looked in the direction of the voice, seeing that the carriage door had been opened by the girl driving it. From it emerged two young people, one golden-haired and one silver-haired, both with handsome and delicate features, and an extraordinary demeanor. [[8840 旁白 neutral]]
"This soldier, we are clergy from the Windermere territory, and this is my friend accompanying me." [[8841 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An casually introduced the identities of the three of them. [[8842 旁白 neutral]]
"As for this Iron Lion mercenary group, they tried to intercept my carriage halfway. Fortunately, I had been diligently cultivating in Windermere and had some basic martial skills, plus a bit of luck and the Wind God's blessing, I managed to subdue these lawless individuals." [[8843 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man said this, patting his chest at the right moment with a look of lingering fear, as if it truly was divine blessing and good fortune. [[8844 旁白 neutral]]
The city guard squad captain looked at the Iron Lion mercenaries lined up like prisoners and listened to the young man's vivid account, his mouth twitching uncontrollably. [[8845 旁白 neutral]]
If there were only three to five mercenary members before him, he might have believed the young priest's words. But this was the Iron Lion mercenary group, and an entire one! [[8846 旁白 neutral]]
The bounty for the Iron Lion mercenary group members had been posted in the city for more than a day or two, and the reward amount was very tempting, but in reality, very few people dared to take on this task. These guys were very cunning, picking on easy targets; if they could win, they fought, if not, they ran. Even catching one was very difficult, and this priest caught them all... [[8847 旁白 neutral]]
From this perspective, the priest's words needed to be carefully considered. At least, the "basic martial skills" he mentioned earlier seemed to have a lot of "water" in them... [[8848 旁白 neutral]]
The squad captain subtly wiped the sweat from his forehead, then compared the faces of the mercenaries, confirming they all matched, and turned to Selen An. [[8849 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you for your efforts. These suspects will be taken to the Judicial Department by me. Once their identities are confirmed and interrogated, the bounty will be delivered to you as soon as possible. However, the identity verification process before entering the city cannot be omitted." [[8850 陌生男1 neutral]]
Facing such a capable priest, the squad captain spoke as gently as possible. [[8851 旁白 neutral]]
Similarly, Selen An's strength also refreshed his perception of the combat capabilities of Windermere's clergy. Were all priests and nuns in that free land so "slightly skilled" in martial arts? [[8852 旁白 neutral]]
If so, then Windermere's combat power would be terrifying. [[8853 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes, yes, please wait..." [[8854 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An had certainly prepared essential documents like ID cards before leaving, not just his own, but Serafina's too. [[8855 旁白 neutral]]
The squad captain looked at the documents he had received, muttering and comparing them. [[8856 旁白 neutral]]
"Andre Vickers... Sera Howard... certified by the Windermere Church..." [[8857 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Thank you for your cooperation, Father. Your identities are in order, but as for your friend here..." [[8858 陌生男1 neutral]]
The squad captain glanced at the beautiful woman standing beside him, who also had an extraordinary aura. Identity checks before entering the city were for two reasons: one was to collect taxes, and the other was to prevent wanted criminals or demon spies. Although it was unlikely for companions of two clergy to be the latter, it was still part of the procedure. [[8859 旁白 neutral]]
Or... just let it go? [[8860 旁白 neutral]]
Being able to hold the position of squad captain, the man was a shrewd individual. However, this was Giant Rock City, a land protected by the Rock God. Under the influence of this guardian deity, Ainwell Territory's city defense work was often the most stringent. If any oversight occurred under his watch... but offending a priest from the Church directly didn't seem like a wise choice either. [[8861 旁白 neutral]]
Just as the captain was caught in a dilemma, Windsor proactively stepped forward. [[8862 陌生女1 neutral]]
"No need to worry, I have corresponding items that can prove my identity." [[8863 陌生女1 neutral]]
When a badge with a cross-sword engraved on it was placed in the squad captain's palm, the man's pupils visibly contracted for a moment. He immediately stood at attention, and with a loyal expression, held the badge with both hands, returning it. [[8864 旁白 neutral]]
"It is a guest from the Lowell family. Please forgive my rudeness just now." [[8865 陌生男1 neutral]]
"It's fine..." [[8866 陌生女1 neutral]]
The surname Lowell seemed to have attracted the attention of some people around, and many began to whisper. But Selen An's attention was clearly not on this name, but was drawn to another object that Wendini had pulled out along with the badge. Although she quickly put it away, that momentary glance made him feel as if time had slowed down countless times—it was a necklace, and the pendant part of the necklace hung a small gem sword that looked like it had been carved from stone. [[8867 旁白 neutral]]
"Hestia..." [[8868 塞伦安 neutral]]
He couldn't help but murmur. [[8869 旁白 neutral]]
"Eh?" [[8870 温蒂尼 surprised]]
Wendini, who was politely chatting with the soldier, felt as if she had hallucinated. She seemed to have heard the Goddess's true name just now, but this was the land of the Rock God. How could anyone remember that Goddess's true name here? [[8871 旁白 neutral]]
She turned her head following the sensation and saw the young priest standing beside her with a somewhat dazed expression. His emerald-like, poetically romantic eyes even flashed with a hint of azure for a moment. [[8872 旁白 neutral]]
Wendini felt as if something was wrong with her body. How could she be hallucinating and seeing things at the same time? [[8873 旁白 neutral]]
How could a normal person's eyes temporarily change color? [[8874 旁白 neutral]]
"Young Master." [[8875 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Seraphina, who had been constantly focusing on Selen An, noticed the abnormality and immediately moved closer, worriedly taking the young man's hand. [[8876 旁白 neutral]]
"It's fine. Perhaps it's the bumps from the journey. My head was a little dizzy just now. It seems I need to rest early after entering the city." [[8877 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An waved his hand, indicating he was fine. [[8878 旁白 neutral]]
The city guard squad captain immediately arranged for the three of them to enter the city. These three had extraordinary identities; two were clergy, and the other was connected to the Lowell family. He quickly let them all in, otherwise, if he offended any side, he would be in deep trouble. [[8879 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Andrew, are you alright?" [[8880 温蒂尼 neutral]]
Wendini asked with slight concern. [[8881 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm fine, I'm just a bit tired. I apologize, Miss Windsor, but perhaps we should part ways for now. I really need to rest early." [[8882 塞伦安 neutral]]
