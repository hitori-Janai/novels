Chapter 36: Reset 36 - The Holy Song [[2070 旁白 neutral]]
The blur in his vision was like a brief disconnect between consciousness and reality. When he came back to his senses, Kgersa seemed to realize something, his pupils contracting sharply. [[2071 旁白 surprised]]
The air was no longer filled only with the howling of the biting wind, because a sound had broken through the storm's noise, covering it and spreading to every corner. [[2072 旁白 neutral]]
It was a song... [[2073 旁白 neutral]]
It was a sacred melody that brought peace to the soul. [[2074 旁白 neutral]]
Like a gentle mother comforting an injured child, all pain and despair found solace at this moment. Anger was quenched by the gentle, flowing voice, turning into a wave of grievance that made one want to fall into a loved one's arms and weep. [[2075 旁白 sad]]
Kgersa turned his head stiffly, his neck creaking like a rusty axle. He looked behind him, muttering. [[2076 旁白 fearful]]
"A Holy Song... It's a Chanter." [[2077 克格萨 surprised]]
As a high-ranking Great Demon, Kgersa was very familiar with the methods of the Church. Besides the divine arts used by priests and clerics, the Church had a special group of clergy to deal with the Abyss's corruption and curses—the Chanters. [[2078 旁白 neutral]]
Just as every church of a certain size has a choir of devout young boys and girls with pure voices, the Chanters were the best of the best, meticulously selected from local choirs by archbishops or bishops. [[2079 旁白 neutral]]
Ordinary choir members could only recite simple hymns or songs of blessing, but Chanters were worthy of singing Holy Songs. Every Holy Song was said to have been composed by a god. Singing a Holy Song was, in a way, using the language of the gods to command a small portion of their power. [[2080 旁白 neutral]]
The more devout a Chanter's faith and the deeper their understanding of the Holy Song, the greater its effect. [[2081 旁白 neutral]]
In Kgersa's memory, the most powerful Chanter he knew was a saint from the Church named Nataya. That legendary Chanter went alone into a small city long consumed by the Abyss and plague and, with a single holy hymn, drove out all evil and uncleanness from the city. [[2082 旁白 neutral]]
Many such cases had forced the demons to admit that the Church's Holy Songs held a power that was hard to ignore. But this power was mostly for purification or buffing themselves and their allies. [[2083 旁白 neutral]]
To put it nicely, they helped their allies win more easily. To put it bluntly, they were just another type of support, like priests. [[2084 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how miraculous a Holy Song was, it was only for support, not for hard control! A Holy Song that could forcefully control the actions of a Great Demon was completely unheard of! [[2085 旁白 surprised]]
Perhaps the Church really did have Holy Songs that could influence the body or soul, but that didn't matter now. What Kgersa wanted to know most was, in this godforsaken place with such a large-scale battle, which death-defying cleric had come here looking for trouble? [[2086 旁白 angry]]
If he found out it was just some ordinary Chanter with only buffing abilities and no combat power, he swore he would rip off their limbs, cut off their head, and take it back as a wine cup or a trophy. [[2087 旁白 angry]]
But when he saw who had arrived, these thoughts were instantly forgotten. [[2088 旁白 surprised]]
Water. He saw endless water. The water falling from the sky, the water melting on the ground, the water held in the air, and the water that people normally couldn't see or touch. All of it materialized as soldiers awaiting orders beside the blurry figure approaching from the horizon. [[2089 旁白 fearful]]
Beside her, a spiraling pillar of water reaching for the heavens was like a celestial column supporting the sky. It was a great power connecting heaven and earth, possessing the majesty of a deity descending upon the world. [[2090 旁白 fearful]]
Accompanied by an ethereal and graceful girl's chant, the daylight pierced the dark clouds like a sharp sword. A huge pillar of light shone down on the horizon, enveloping the holy figure bathed in the embrace of divine water. [[2091 旁白 surprised]]
The dark clouds overhead shattered with a roar, transforming into a gentle, dense spring rain that poured down on every corner of this desolate wasteland. [[2092 旁白 neutral]]
The wind blew again, but this time it wasn't the freezing wind that sealed all life, but a spring breeze that cleansed with life. [[2093 旁白 neutral]]
A spring breeze, as gentle as the warm sun, swept over the thick snow on the wasteland. The pale snow melted, and the bone-chilling cold vanished with it, turning into the purest source of life with the spring wind, injecting new vitality into this withered, desperate land. [[2094 旁白 neutral]]
The Ice of Misfortune, which was nearly impossible to melt with external heat, shed its hard shell under the soothing comfort of this seemingly gentle wind and light. It returned to the control of the singer in a gentler, more forgiving form. [[2095 旁白 neutral]]
The sky, as full of compassion as the song itself, cleared of its gloomy clouds and opened up. The azure canopy returned to its place above this land. [[2096 旁白 neutral]]
The demon soldiers who had already lost their lives in the blizzard thawed from their icy shells, their bodies slumping over as cold corpses. The lucky ones on the fringes had just broken free from the ice, shivering, when they were immediately affected by the song filling the air. [[2097 旁白 neutral]]
Their blood-stained eyes, without exception, lost all will to fight and kill. Like bewildered children, they acted on instinct, all looking ahead in unison... [[2098 旁白 neutral]]
Because there, stood the singer. [[2099 旁白 neutral]]
When Kgersa finally saw the face of the person singing the Holy Song, his once-unsettled expression was immediately overcome with terror. [[2100 旁白 fearful]]
No, this is impossible! [[2101 克格萨 fearful]]
He knew that face. He definitely knew it. It should be said that every high-ranking Great Demon would never forget it, even in death! [[2102 旁白 fearful]]
Sea-blue long hair, eyes like divine water droplets, faint golden scales visible on her neck, and a blue-green swallowtail sacred dress. These iconic features and attire were a perfect replica of every generation of the Water Saintess. [[2103 旁白 surprised]]
The one causing such a commotion was undoubtedly the Water Saintess. To part the clouds and purify hearts with a single Holy Song fit her status. But, but... [[2104 旁白 surprised]]
Wasn't the sole heir of the Water Saintess's direct line just ruined by Mara? [[2105 旁白 surprised]]
How did another one pop out? [[2106 旁白 surprised]]
An imposter? Even more impossible! [[2107 旁白 fearful]]
That song, filled with the radiance of motherhood, could make any intelligent being voluntarily lay down their arms and avoid conflict. This ability also matched the authority the Water Saintess inherited from the God of Water. [[2108 旁白 neutral]]
None of this could be faked! [[2109 旁白 fearful]]
Thus, the answer was obvious. The person before him was Selen An. [[2110 旁白 fearful]]
As for why he had changed into this form, Kgersa could figure it out with a moment's thought. [[2111 旁白 neutral]]
It was like how a human implanted with a Succubus Seed would fully degenerate into a succubus. Selen An was a pure descendant of a saintess. He was useless before because the bloodline within him had not awakened. Once a bloodline awakens, the divine blood deposited in the body is activated, and the body, washed and nourished by it, will reveal its proper form. [[2112 旁白 neutral]]
He stared blankly as the Water Saintess walked steadily up to him. She paid no mind to his gaze, her movements gentle as she carefully lifted the still-sleeping Ice Saintess from the black ice, as if afraid the slightest force would wake her. [[2113 旁白 sad]]
Her gentle, water-droplet eyes, like a pool of autumn water, rippled with tenderness and affection. [[2114 旁白 neutral]]
And behind her, a deer made of pure water elements carried a likewise unconscious, blonde commoner girl on its back. [[2115 旁白 neutral]]
So... he had Mara drag Selen An down, but that incompetent bungler not only failed but also managed to awaken a Saintess's bloodline for him? [[2116 旁白 angry]]
Mara, f*ck you! [[2117 克格萨 angry]]
