Chapter 122: The Third Prophecy [[7245 旁白 neutral]]
    "If you do this, I will only lose part of my soul, but you will lose your entire life!" [[7246 弗拉德 angry]]
    He thought everything was in his grasp, but at the most critical moment, something went wrong. When it truly came down to a fight to the death, Vlad still showed a hint of panic. [[7247 旁白 fearful]]
    Everything has its pros and cons. High-ranking bloodkin have bodies that are almost immortal, but their deep red souls are more vulnerable to divine and holy substances. [[7248 旁白 neutral]]
    More importantly, soul-level damage is extremely difficult to recover from, and the souls of bloodkin are vital to their bodies. If a complete soul becomes incomplete, it's very possible that the body's strength will exceed the soul's limit, leading to an uncontrollable breakdown into chaotic tumors and monsters. [[7249 旁白 neutral]]
    Unless necessary, bloodkin would often rather lose an entire body than let their soul suffer even the slightest damage. The longevity of bloodkin is not a divine blessing like that of elves; their souls are not as solid as those of the equally long-lived elves, and with the erosion of time, the outcome is obvious... [[7250 旁白 neutral]]
    The longer and stronger a bloodkin lives, the more severe these problems become, and Vlad is no exception. [[7251 旁白 neutral]]
    He didn't want a perfectly good hunt to ultimately become the root cause of his decline. [[7252 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "It doesn't matter, I wasn't going to live long anyway, right?" [[7253 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    The girl in the wind had her green hair wildly fluttering. She stood in the hurricane, a fearless curve on her slightly childish face. [[7254 旁白 neutral]]
    "Fool! Even if you really go mad and destroy this part of my soul, you can't truly kill me. Even if you really don't care about your life and want to go down together, the final result will only be the fish dying, but the net won't break." [[7255 弗拉德 angry]]
    "Think about it, once you die, Windermere territory, without the Saintess's protection, will quickly fall into chaos. I think you also know that those corrupt old geezers in the court only care about their own interests, their hearts only hold their own power and wealth, and they never even glance at the so-called commoners!" [[7256 弗拉德 angry]]
    "As soon as you die, the Windermere border guards will surely be affected, even mutiny, and I will definitely avenge this, leading the demon cavalry to trampler your cherished land into scorched earth!" [[7257 弗拉德 angry]]
    At this point, it was Vlad who began to persuade the Wind Saintess not to give up on treatment, mainly because the current situation was too chaotic. [[7258 旁白 neutral]]
    He admitted that he had been arrogant before, originally thinking the situation was under his control, but he didn't expect to be backstabbed at the critical moment. Who would have thought that a bloodkin he personally embraced could defy orders and defect? [[7259 弗拉德 surprised]]
    Such a problem had almost never appeared in the history of bloodkin, as bloodkin naturally have absolute control over the bodies of lower bloodkin. As for soul-level issues, during the embrace, a normal person's soul is already strongly tainted with the master's color, and they will sincerely obey any of the master's commands. [[7260 旁白 neutral]]
    Even if someone with strong will endured the first wave of the embrace, the long torment afterward is a major test for the soul. After all, the body has already become bloodkin, and the soul controlling the body will unknowingly be influenced and changed; this process is unstoppable! [[7261 旁白 neutral]]
    Who knew that nun named Seraphina would be so lucky during the blessing! [[7262 弗拉德 surprised]]
    In reality, after Vlad saw the white feather mark blooming in Seraphina's eyes, he instantly understood everything. This Holy Nun, whom he personally embraced, was special— [[7263 旁白 neutral]]
    Every woman who can be canonized as a Holy Nun is special, but Seraphina is special among the special. [[7264 旁白 neutral]]
    As everyone knows, when a Saintess canonizes a Holy Knight or Holy Nun, she traditionally bestows a blessing upon this follower who has signed a soul contract with her. There's nothing wrong with this; the abilities and enhancements everyone gains through the blessing depend on luck. [[7265 旁白 neutral]]
    Some Holy Nuns gain increased affinity with corresponding attributes through blessings, some gain talent enhancement or awakening in certain areas through blessings, and even more rarely, some can directly gain partial sharing of the corresponding nun's authority through blessings, which is extremely rare in the entire history of the Church. [[7266 旁白 neutral]]
    The legendary Saint Singer Natalia was one such case. She also received a blessing from a certain generation of Wind Saintess and gained partial sharing of her authority, allowing her song alone to cleanse an entire city of impurity. Therefore, she was given the title of Saint by the Church. [[7267 旁白 neutral]]
    In short, Holy Nuns themselves are extraordinary beings, a goal many low-level clergy pursue their entire lives but find hard to reach. Cases where a Holy Nun also receives an authority blessing are even rarer, so rare that they are worthy of being recorded in history. [[7268 旁白 neutral]]
    In the symbols of the Wind God's authority, irises represent wisdom, and pure white feathers represent freedom. [[7269 旁白 neutral]]
    The pure white feather light mark appearing in her pupils indicates that Seraphina's soul, like the Wind Saintess's, is also protected by the authority of freedom. Even if he embraced her into a bloodkin, while enslaving her body, he could not truly possess her soul. [[7270 旁白 neutral]]
    If the body is compared to a machine, and the soul is the machine's owner, even though he changed her body and gained nominal absolute control over it, it might refer to a situation where the soul has already completely surrendered. [[7271 旁白 neutral]]
    So, at the brink of life and death, Seraphina being able to briefly break through the control of a higher-ranking bloodkin is actually very reasonable. [[7272 旁白 neutral]]
    The Wind Saintess being able to hide such a treasure of a Holy Nun even from the high-ranking officials of the Church is very unreasonable. [[7273 旁白 neutral]]
    At least from this point, it can be seen that the relationship between the Wind Saintess and the high-ranking officials of the Wind Church is not as amicable as it appears on the surface. [[7274 旁白 neutral]]
    So, getting back to the point, who would have thought that a Holy Nun he caught on a whim would be a hidden SSR? [[7275 弗拉德 surprised]]
    If, Vlad said if, if everything went according to the normal process, Seraphina, who possessed divine blessings, would definitely be a notable figure specially recorded by the Church. With his level of infiltration in the Church, he would surely have noticed, and such an oversight would never have occurred... [[7276 弗拉德 neutral]]
    But facts are facts, there are no ifs. Once a hidden danger is planted, someone will inevitably bear the consequences after it explodes. [[7277 旁白 neutral]]
    At this point, the most crucial issue is to persuade the Wind Saintess, who is ready to go down fighting. Losing a part of his soul means he won't die, that's true, but how can the soul of a sixth-tier powerful person be restored or compensated just like that? [[7278 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Moreover, the soul has always been a weakness for bloodkin. If such a large piece of soul were severely cut off, even if he were to truly unleash his anger on the Wind Saintess's territory, it wouldn't change the fact that he would fall into a long period of weakness. When he returns to the Demon Realm, those older immortals who once coveted his position, and some rising younger generations... [[7279 弗拉德 fearful]]
    Bloodkin are not monolithic; if they were to see him in a weakened state, he couldn't guarantee that those juniors who usually treated him with respect wouldn't unleash the traditional bloodkin ability—backstabbing. [[7280 弗拉德 fearful]]
    Vlad tried every method to persuade Celeste to calm down. Things had developed to a point where he alone could no longer control them. [[7281 旁白 neutral]]
    "Proud Grand Duke, you thought you controlled the entire situation, secretly pushing everything forward, but little did you know, little did you know, your opponent was also setting a trap for you, wasn't she?" [[7282 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Celeste, holding her holy sword, took in the fleeting panic in Vlad's eyes. She smiled, smiling at his cowardice, smiling at finally reaching this point. [[7283 旁白 neutral]]
    "You don't need to threaten me with the stability of the Windermere territory after my death. Rest assured, before coming here, I have made the most complete preparations possible." [[7284 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Her face was unburdened, like a long-prepared suicide, who, after dealing with all possible troubles, stood on the high platform about to jump, with only the relief of impending death in her eyes. [[7285 旁白 neutral]]
    Before coming to the town of Kempfer, she had already prepared for the worst outcome of this trip. Windermere Ridge is vast, and such a large territory cannot be without a Saintess for a single day. Therefore, she had to ensure that after her death, her family could immediately nominate a qualified successor for the Saintess position. [[7286 旁白 neutral]]
    Fortunately, she had long prepared for this. Over the years, she had been observing within the clan and had now discovered a promising candidate—a clan sister not favored by the family, with a dignified appearance, steady and resilient character, and very methodical in her conduct. She was a girl capable of great things; her only flaw was her collateral lineage and low divine blood concentration. [[7287 旁白 neutral]]
    If her bloodline concentration were higher, those clan elders who disliked her might have discovered this promising talent years ago and nominated her, making her the biggest rival on her path to inheriting the Saintess position. [[7288 旁白 neutral]]
    In some aspects, apart from bloodline, that clan sister was indeed more suitable to inherit the Saintess position than herself. If something truly happened to her, she would indeed be the best candidate, and she also had a way to solve the bloodline problem— [[7289 旁白 neutral]]
    Before leaving, she had entrusted something to Windsor: an alchemy flask containing primal divine blood, a good thing she had extracted from her own blood by an alchemist over the past few years without severely compromising her health. [[7290 旁白 neutral]]
    Although the amount of primal divine blood in that bottle was not much, and collateral branches could not achieve such high bloodline purity as herself after using it, bloodline is not necessarily better the purer it is. As long as it is raised to a certain threshold and can resonate with a deity's authority, that is enough to meet the minimum standard for becoming a Saintess. [[7291 旁白 neutral]]
    With ability and a qualified bloodline, coupled with the assistance of the ten Holy Nuns she left behind, that clever clan sister will surely quickly understand her intentions and stabilize the situation. [[7292 旁白 neutral]]
    As for other large and small local issues after her death, Celeste no longer had the energy or time to consider them. If she were to investigate them one by one, she probably wouldn't finish even when the Thorns Curse on her acted up. [[7293 旁白 neutral]]
    Anyway, as long as a Saintess can quickly take over after her death and the overall situation can stabilize, minor issues can be dealt with slowly later. As for herself, the former Saintess who is about to become a thing of the past, her life is not so cheap! [[7294 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    If he wants her body, he must be prepared to be fiercely bitten before she retaliates in her dying moments! [[7295 旁白 angry]]
    Meeting the girl's gaze, Vlad unconsciously took half a step back, shaking his head and muttering. [[7296 旁白 neutral]]
    "Impossible, my plan hasn't been leaked. Even if Avil's soul is protected by authority, her body is still under my control. She couldn't possibly have had the chance to reveal so much to you, and besides, the risk of doing so..." [[7297 弗拉德 surprised]]
    "You're right, no matter how fully prepared I am, as a Saintess, such an act would be somewhat reckless and irresponsible. Under normal circumstances, I probably wouldn't choose this path, but fate has shown me another possibility..." [[7298 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    As she spoke, a pure, azure figure appeared in Celeste's mind, and this memory was not recent, but from a past prophetic vision. [[7299 旁白 neutral]]
    Although Avil, after becoming a bloodkin, couldn't normally convey messages to her through language or writing secret codes, they were master and servant who had signed a soul contract after all, and Avil still possessed a portion of witch bloodline within her. [[7300 旁白 neutral]]
    Witches had many titles in ancient times. Powerful witches were revered as Demonesses, those skilled in changing celestial phenomena and summoning wind and rain were called Rain Masters, and witches who could receive prophetic hints from dreams also possessed some dream abilities, and these witches were called Dream Witches. [[7301 旁白 neutral]]
    Unable to convey information through language, various bodily actions, or even micro-expressions, Seraphina, in a midday dream, inserted some scenes she had seen into her dream. [[7302 旁白 neutral]]
    In that dream, she saw blood-red light filling the sky, a red-haired witch, a pair of cherry-haired and white-haired vampires, herself bound to a cross, and an azure figure emerging from the shimmering water, impossible to look away from. [[7303 旁白 neutral]]
    Even just seeing her in a dream, the golden divine blood from her lineage pulsed uncontrollably. It was the resonance between fellow Saintesses, an unmistakable heartbeat. [[7304 旁白 neutral]]
    The scenes in the dream were brief and rapid, yet they contained a wealth of explosive information. Seraphina merely put these scenes into her dream and nothing else, but she, who knew Seraphina's character well, had already guessed—this was the third prophecy she had seen as a witch. [[7305 旁白 neutral]]
    Her fate had changed. Unlike the second time, when she was surrounded and trapped by demon cavalry in the wilderness, this time, her destiny seemed to rest in an obscure, inconspicuous town. She was targeted by bloodkin, which also aligned with the fact that Seraphina was inexplicably embraced into a bloodkin. [[7306 旁白 neutral]]
    The only thing that surprised her and made her dare to take a gamble was that figure. She had never seen it before, yet felt an immediate familiarity. Just quietly recalling the frozen image of that figure in her memory, her heart felt infinite peace and tranquility. [[7307 旁白 neutral]]
    Although she didn't know why the Water Saintess would appear in her destiny, since fate had arranged it this way, why not seize the opportunity fate presented? [[7308 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Even though she had never seen her, it didn't prevent her from believing. After all, in the recorded history of the Church throughout generations, every Water Saintess has almost always been praised as supremely good and pure. How could such a kind and pure Saintess see another Saintess in distress and not offer help? [[7309 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
