Chapter 80: Miss Moying [[4529 旁白 neutral]]
    This was definitely Andre's most uncomfortable experience. [[4530 旁白 neutral]]
    Before this, he had never tried the effect of being forcibly interrupted halfway through a transformation. Now that he had experienced it, it felt terrible. To describe the feeling—it was like Xuanzang meditating, with a stink bug transformed by the Deer Strength Immortal stinging his face, an unbearable itch and pain, yet he couldn't scratch it off. [[4531 旁白 fearful]]
    The half-activated divine blood had already begun to affect his body, but to avoid exposure, he had to forcibly suppress it with his mind. [[4532 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre really wanted to curse right now. He had already prepared himself to reveal his true form to solve the problem, he had made all the psychological preparations, but just as he was about to transform, the damn support arrived at that very moment! [[4533 旁白 angry]]
    Having support was a good thing, but this kind of terrible situation, similar to being halfway through relieving himself and having to forcibly cut it off, he never wanted to experience it a second time in his life. [[4534 旁白 angry]]
    However, apart from his own terrible experience, Andre had to admit that this time's reinforcements were truly powerful. To be able to unleash such terrifying wind magic, and at the same time control its power just right, without affecting the nearby town in the slightest, this level of meticulous elemental control—could it really be the Wind Saintess herself? [[4535 旁白 surprised]]
    As he was slowly dragged down to the ground by the wind, many thoughts flashed through Andre's mind. [[4536 旁白 neutral]]
    And the one who affirmed and answered these thoughts was Isabella, who flew over. The nun, who was usually lazy and cunning, seemed like a different person. She descended from the sky, put away all her magic, and knelt on one knee towards the figure who landed with her. [[4537 旁白 neutral]]
    "Holy Nun Isabella greets the Saint..." [[4538 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Cough cough!" [[4539 旁白 neutral]]
    A clear cough interrupted Isabella. Andre, who had stood up from the wind-swept battlefield, also looked at this magic master who had made such a high-profile move. [[4540 旁白 neutral]]
    The thousand winds swirling around her dispersed, revealing a delicate and lovely girlish face, slightly childish. Her soft, teal long hair was tied into two pigtails, secured on both sides. She wore a nun's robe embroidered with the Wind God's crest, identical to Isabella's, and her lower body consisted of typical white tights paired with brown loafers. [[4541 旁白 neutral]]
    So cute! [[4542 旁白 happy]]
    This was Andre's subconscious first impression when he saw the girl. [[4543 旁白 neutral]]
    This girl was truly the type who was very girlish and cute, very pure, yet inexplicably gave people a feeling of extreme resilience. [[4544 旁白 neutral]]
    But why did this face look more and more familiar the more he looked at it? It seemed... [[4545 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, Sister Isabella, we are both Twelve Holy Nuns, why do you always look as if you're facing a great enemy every time you see me? Are you trying to trick me in front of others again?" [[4546 陌生女1 happy]]
    Before Andre could fully understand in his mind, the girl's clear and pleasant voice had already entered his ears. Her voice was soft and sweet, like the cry of an oriole emerging from a valley, clean and clear. [[4547 旁白 neutral]]
    This face, combined with this voice, instantly cleared Andre's somewhat模糊impression! [[4548 旁白 surprised]]
    Isn't this the current Wind Saintess?! [[4549 旁白 surprised]]
    In his previous life, when he browsed forums and online communities, he saw many netizens heavily posting illustrations of the Wind Saintess under posts evaluating the most delicious "bento boxes," claiming that she was the most delicious "bento box" in the world, fresh to be stolen and devoured, and other outrageous remarks. [[4550 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre was still brainstorming when the green-haired girl saw the man standing stunned, constantly winking at Isabella. The latter instantly understood and quickly cooperated with the act. [[4551 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh! Look at my memory, it's just that our little sister Moying looks too much like Her Royal Highness the Saintess. Every time I see you, I habitually make this mistake." [[4552 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Oh, Sister Isabella really needs to improve her memory! Her Royal Highness the Saintess isn't here this time. If she saw your awkward mistake, she would surely tease you mercilessly!" [[4553 陌生女1 happy]]
    The scene immediately turned into a close conversation between good friends. Andre quietly watched the two girls acting, his嘴角twitching, and he forced his expression to return to normal as much as possible. [[4554 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, right, little sister Moying, this is Father Andre, whom I often mention to Her Royal Highness the Saintess." [[4555 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella glanced at Andre. Seeing no unusual expression on his face, she breathed a sigh of relief and began to introduce them to each other. [[4556 旁白 neutral]]
    "Andre, this is Moying, who is one of the Twelve Nuns, just like me. Don't underestimate little sister Moying; in reality, her abilities are far greater than mine. Even Her Royal Highness the Saintess trusts her immensely, and they are practically like sisters!" [[4557 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Andre maintained a tense expression, continuing to watch Isabella patch things up and act. In reality, his inner complaints were almost gushing out. [[4558 旁白 neutral]]
    "Moying" on the side also turned at this moment, looking at Andre with a beaming smile. [[4559 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hello, Mr. Andre, my name is Moying. As for my identity, Sister Isabella has already introduced it. I believe Mr. Andre also finds it annoying and tedious and doesn't want to hear me repeat it." [[4560 陌生女1 happy]]
    "How could that be? To be able to personally meet the legendary Saint... ahem, I mean, to be able to personally meet the renowned Holy Nun, I'm too excited to even feel annoyed!" [[4561 安德烈 neutral]]
    Perhaps it was because they had been acting for too long, or perhaps he had been complaining in his mind for too long, but as soon as Andre opened his mouth, he almost revealed the secret that he had already recognized the other party. Fortunately, he corrected himself in time, and the other party's face only showed a momentary look of surprise before quickly returning to normal. [[4562 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is that so? Although it's our first meeting, Mr. Andre, Sister Isabella has mentioned you many times in her letters to the Grand Cathedral of the Wind God. Now that I've met you in person, indeed, just as Sister Isabella described, Mr. Andre is a very reassuring and reliable person." [[4563 陌生女1 happy]]
    Although the girl's appearance was pure and lovely, her demeanor and etiquette were just right, making people feel very comfortable, not at all inferior to royalty or nobles educated by court teachers since childhood. [[4564 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is that so? Did she really evaluate me like that?" [[4565 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre glanced at Isabella, who was standing respectfully to the side, finding it somewhat amusing. [[4566 旁白 neutral]]
    Usually lazy and casual, but in front of the Saintess, she puts on a gentle and virtuous facade. Could it be that anyone associated with the Wind Saintess automatically has a flair for drama? [[4567 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella, suddenly called out, froze for a moment, then forced out a difficult smile. [[4568 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course! Although Andre doesn't say it usually, I really approve of you in my heart." [[4569 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "I hope so. I still remember someone calling me a pervert who loves to peek at other people's thighs." [[4570 安德烈 neutral]]
    "How could I... Wait, did little sister Evelyn tell you that?!" [[4571 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
    Isabella instinctively wanted to retort, but quickly realized something, covered her mouth, and widened her eyes. [[4572 旁白 surprised]]
    Andre curved his lips, revealing a rare playful expression that seemed to say, "Guess." [[4573 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ahhh, little sister Evelyn is so naughty! How could she tell you such private topics among girls? No! You must have tricked little sister Evelyn and seduced her into saying these things! After all, she's so innocent, it's easy for a big pervert like you to deceive her!" [[4574 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
    Looking at the gray-haired nun whose demeanor changed repeatedly, Andre didn't even know where to begin complaining. [[4575 旁白 neutral]]
    "Whatever makes you happy." [[4576 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Don't put on an innocent face, it was you!" [[4577 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
    Watching the special atmosphere of their conversation, Moying, who was observing from the side, lightly covered her mouth and chuckled. [[4578 旁白 happy]]
    "It seems your relationship is very good when I'm not around~" [[4579 墨莺 happy]]
    "Hmph, I could be close to anyone but this big pervert. Who knows when he'll stare at a girl's sensitive areas with lewd eyes again?" [[4580 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
    "You're right, a great nun who sleeps until 10 AM every day, with the sun already shining on her butt when she gets up, the Wind God is truly blessed to have a worshipper like you~" [[4581 安德烈 neutral]]
    The two of them kept insulting each other, unwilling to give in, until Moying mediated, finally bringing the verbal war to a temporary halt. [[4582 旁白 neutral]]
    "By the way, did the wind just now hurt Mr. Andre?" [[4583 墨莺 neutral]]
    "Not at all, Miss Moying. Your wind magic control is very stable, the strongest I've ever seen among wind mages." [[4584 安德烈 happy]]
    Andre praised her unreservedly. [[4585 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hehe, Mr. Andre, praising me like this, I'm almost embarrassed." [[4586 墨莺 happy]]
    The girl's face showed a timely shy smile as she turned to look in the direction of the town. [[4587 旁白 neutral]]
    "This time, I received an order from Her Royal Highness the Saintess to inspect the situation in Kempfer Town. The unexpected events here slightly accelerated this trip, but since I'm already here, please take good care of me in the coming days, Mr. Andre!" [[4588 墨莺 happy]]
    The girl's brilliant smile made the man slightly愣. Soon, he composed his expression, placed a hand on his chest, and bowed slightly. [[4589 旁白 neutral]]
    "It's my duty." [[4590 安德烈 neutral]]
