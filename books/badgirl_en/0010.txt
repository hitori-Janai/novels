Chapter 10: Reset 10 - Coincidence and Misfortune [[580 旁白 neutral]]
This time, he was woken up by the strong, unpleasant smell of herbs. [[581 旁白 neutral]]
"Cough, cough..." [[582 塞伦安 sad]]
The first thing he felt after waking up was pain and weakness. The strong smell of herbs made him cough twice, and his fragile body felt like it might fall apart. [[583 旁白 sad]]
He desperately tried to sit up from the dry straw, but his trembling body was wracked with a sharp pain from the wound on his left arm. He couldn't stop a pained cry from escaping his lips, as if the pain had drained all his remaining strength. [[584 旁白 fearful]]
Thankfully, a pair of hands suddenly supported him from behind, helping him to sit up and lean against the wall. [[585 旁白 surprised]]
His vision slowly came into focus. He struggled to turn his head and look around, finding himself in a simple wooden hut. [[586 旁白 neutral]]
The walls of the hut were made of old wood, and the furniture was scarce. There was only a simple wooden bed, a wooden box, a small clay stove with a fire burning inside, and a pot bubbling with medicine on top of it. Nothing else... [[587 旁白 neutral]]
"Uh... where is this...?" [[588 塞伦安 surprised]]
"Don't move. Your injuries are serious. It's best if you lie down." [[589 陌生女1 neutral]]
A gentle female voice spoke by his ear as she pressed down on his body, forcing him to lean back again. [[590 旁白 neutral]]
Only then did he see clearly that the person who had helped him up was a young woman in a worn cloth dress with her hair tied up. Although her face was covered in dust and dirt, it was easy to tell that she was quite pretty underneath. [[591 旁白 neutral]]
"This is my home. I found you injured when I was out. Seeing how badly hurt you were, I took the liberty of bringing you back to treat you." [[592 陌生女1 neutral]]
The young woman explained. [[593 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An looked down and saw that he was covered with his own tattered coat, which had been worn out during his escape. As for his left arm, which was still throbbing with pain, the gash on his upper arm was wrapped in yellowish gauze. The gauze was clearly mixed with herbs, showing green herbal juice and seeping blood. [[594 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at his bandaged arm, Selen An forced a grateful smile for the young woman, moving his pale lips while enduring the intense pain. [[595 塞伦安 sad]]
"Thank you for saving my life... cough, cough..." [[596 塞伦安 sad]]
"Sir, you're too weak. You should talk less for now." [[597 陌生女1 neutral]]
The young woman advised him softly. At the same time, a cough was heard from behind him. [[598 旁白 neutral]]
The young woman quickly turned and went to the only wooden bed in the shabby hut. A woman was lying on it, and even under the covers, her swollen belly was clearly visible. [[599 旁白 neutral]]
If he wasn't mistaken, the woman on the bed was pregnant, and far enough along that she could give birth at any moment. [[600 旁白 neutral]]
"Mother, is your stomach hurting again?" [[601 陌生女1 fearful]]
"Ugh... it's alright. It's been like this all month. You, you should go check on that gentleman's injuries first..." [[602 陌生女2 sad]]
The woman's voice was clearly weak and breathless, but you could still tell she was a very gentle mother. [[603 旁白 neutral]]
The young woman looked worriedly at her mother's thin, pale face and her large belly, feeling anxious but helpless. [[604 旁白 sad]]
Her mother's stomach ache wasn't from sickness, but from hunger. As a woman about to give birth, she desperately needed nutrition and care. But here in the Craigmore wasteland, there was nothing but endless barren land. [[605 旁白 sad]]
Food and water were scarce here. [[606 旁白 sad]]
Even though she worked hard and searched for supplies every day, she could barely find enough for the two of them. Her mother was already pregnant when they fled, and now, in this harsh environment, she was suffering from malnutrition. [[607 旁白 sad]]
The woman stroked the young woman's hand and just shook her head, telling her not to worry. [[608 旁白 sad]]
The young woman hid her anxiety, knowing that worrying alone wouldn't help. She got up to take care of the medicine pot bubbling on the clay stove. [[609 旁白 neutral]]
"Sir, can you lift your arm? Let me change your medicine." [[610 陌生女1 neutral]]
The young woman carefully placed the steaming pot on the ground and lifted the lid, revealing a dark green paste inside. [[611 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as Selen An lifted his hand, the small movement pulled at his wound, causing a sharp pain that made him grit his teeth and let out a miserable cry. [[612 旁白 fearful]]
Seeing this, the young woman felt sorry for him. She came forward and rested his arm on her knees, then began to unwrap the bandage to clean the wound and apply new medicine. [[613 旁白 neutral]]
He had barely survived, and now he was completely unable to move. At this moment, Selen An had no energy to worry about whether the Demon Clan's army was still chasing him or what had happened to Serenia. He just watched the young woman's face as she seriously cleaned his wound and changed the dressing. [[614 旁白 neutral]]
At first, he thought it was just like a scene from an R-rated game. Any random commoner, an NPC in the game, looked incredibly beautiful up close in reality. But as he kept looking, he felt a strange sense of familiarity. [[615 旁白 surprised]]
Perhaps feeling his gaze, the young woman looked away. [[616 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, you saved my life, but I still don't know your name." [[617 塞伦安 neutral]]
"...Anna. My name is Anna." [[618 安娜 neutral]]
The young woman was silent at first. When she had almost finished changing the dressing, she suddenly looked up and answered. Her clear eyes met Selen An's, as if she was trying to find something in them. [[619 旁白 surprised]]
Hearing the name "Anna" and seeing the young woman's face, the massive amount of information that had been poured into his brain began to churn again. Memories related to the keyword "Anna" surfaced. [[620 旁白 surprised]]
So it was her... [[621 旁白 surprised]]
Selen An's feelings suddenly became very complicated. [[622 旁白 sad]]
From a player's perspective, this young woman named Anna was not an ordinary NPC. She had appeared in the game's animated cutscenes. [[623 旁白 neutral]]
The original Selen An was known as a profligate scion who had done many evil things. He had harmed many girls, and Anna was one of them. [[624 旁白 sad]]
Anna was originally an ordinary citizen in Saint-Contlan. But she was unlucky. Her greatest misfortune was being knocked over in the street by the great villain, Selen An. Because of her beauty and her simple, pure demeanor, which was different from that of noble ladies, Selen An took an interest in her. [[625 旁白 sad]]
What followed was the familiar story of a noble oppressing a commoner. Selen An used his power to try and take Anna by force. When Anna's father found out, he impulsively went to Selen An's home and knelt, begging him to spare his daughter and their family. [[626 旁白 sad]]
The news that a commoner had kneeled before a direct descendant of a Saintess quickly spread throughout Saint-Contlan. Selen An was criticized and mocked by his family and the public. He held a grudge and designed a plot to beat the poor father to death in a small alley. [[627 旁白 angry]]
A neighbor happened to pass by and saw it, then ran home to tell Anna and her mother. Fortunately, Anna's family had a good relationship with their neighbors. They pooled their money and efforts to help the mother and daughter escape the city before Selen An could get to them. [[628 旁白 neutral]]
By the time Selen An realized what had happened, Anna's home was empty. With the neighbors covering for them, he saw that he couldn't catch them. At that time, Selen An had already given up on himself, so he didn't care much and went back to his life of indulgence. [[629 旁白 neutral]]
He never thought that what was a minor incident in his eyes had caused this mother and daughter to lose their family's provider, lose their home, and flee to this wasteland, suffering greatly along the way. [[630 旁白 sad]]
Thinking of this, Selen An felt a strong sense of guilt, but at the same time, he kept telling himself that the original owner of this body had done these things, not him. [[631 旁白 sad]]
He was just an unlucky guy who happened to transmigrate into this body. In a way, he was a victim too. [[632 旁白 sad]]
But no matter how he tried to comfort himself, the guilt and sinfulness churned inside him, and he couldn't find peace. [[633 旁白 sad]]
Having those memories made it feel as if he had done those terrible things himself... [[634 旁白 sad]]
He felt confused. Feeling the young woman's intentional gaze on him, he subconsciously lowered his eyes to hide his panic. [[635 旁白 fearful]]
"Is, is that so... Anna, that's a very nice name..." [[636 塞伦安 fearful]]
Then, the air fell silent. [[637 旁白 neutral]]
