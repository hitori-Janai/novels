Chapter 109: First Embrace of Blood Sacrifice [[6418 旁白 neutral]]
    Vlad, who had just broken free from the illusion, had barely regained his sight of the outside world. He was still thinking about how to hold onto his hatred, but the rampant blood and water elements in the air were almost tearing apart the altar he had set up. [[6419 旁白 fearful]]
    With no time to figure out what was happening, Vlad, relying on the blood clan's instinctive perception and warning of danger, immediately drew the sword hanging at his waist and chanted briefly. [[6420 旁白 neutral]]
    "Sword, please drink my blood." [[6421 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Three sharp bone spurs immediately protruded from the hilt of the classical and exquisite sword, piercing through the back of the hand holding the sword. Blood splattered, and the white bone spurs, having absorbed the blood, immediately turned crimson. Similarly, the originally metallic, slender sword body also seemed to be coated with a layer of blood. [[6422 旁白 neutral]]
    "Drink!" [[6423 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Vlad composed himself and swung his sword. The surging sword energy tore apart the storm that was about to shatter the altar, but the torn gap was quickly refilled with an endless stream of rampant energy, and the crisis situation replayed itself. [[6424 旁白 fearful]]
    The sixth-tier Vlad clearly realized this. He swung three more swords in quick succession. The sword, enhanced by the blood sacrifice, was terrifyingly strong. The three separate sword energies temporarily resolved the crisis, but it was only temporary... [[6425 旁白 neutral]]
    As long as the elemental storm in the center didn't stop, waves like this would return no matter how many times they were torn apart. [[6426 旁白 neutral]]
    "Master, something is wrong. Perhaps we should..." [[6427 艾薇儿 fearful]]
    Avril, who was barely standing while holding the cross, shouted with difficulty. Her voice couldn't travel far in the storm and reached Vlad's ears weakly, but it seemed to infuriate the capricious blood clan Grand Duke, making his face immediately unpredictable. [[6428 旁白 angry]]
    "Shut up! It's just a bit of wind and frost!" [[6429 弗拉德 angry]]
    Although Vlad said this, he was somewhat timid deep down after witnessing the raging storm caused by the collision of water and blood. [[6430 旁白 fearful]]
    God knows why such a small place would suddenly erupt with forbidden spell-level power. Cayetana was one thing; after all, she was a sixth-tier blood clan Grand Duke, and she could reach that level of power when fighting for her life. But who released the other forbidden spell? [[6431 旁白 neutral]]
    Are there other sixth-tier individuals on this battlefield? [[6432 旁白 neutral]]
    The best course of action now was to retreat. The situation was unclear, and rashly getting involved would easily lead to disaster. Vlad was not a fool and understood this principle. The current power level was already enough to pose a fatal danger to him. [[6433 旁白 neutral]]
    Mainly, Avril hadn't mentioned retreating before, which instinctively annoyed him. His pride as a blood clan made him unable to tolerate his subordinate's advice to retreat. [[6434 旁白 angry]]
    "Proceed according to the original plan. Perfect, such a terrifying elemental storm will affect the entire Kempfa Town, no, the entire Windermere Territory!" [[6435 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "This is good. The first embrace ritual will be carried out early. I want the Wind Saintess to understand what despair is in this world-ending storm!" [[6436 弗拉德 angry]]
    As his voice fell, taking advantage of the disturbed elements that had just been torn open not yet filling the gaps around the altar, the shadow beneath Vlad's feet immediately exploded like ink, quickly enveloping and covering the entire altar. [[6437 旁白 neutral]]
    [Domain • Night Cage] [[6438 旁白 neutral]]
    Vlad, possessing immense magic power, didn't care about using his domain directly as a barrier. A huge unforeseen change had occurred in the original plan, and while it wasn't enough to make him panic, he didn't want to see any more "loopholes." [[6439 旁白 neutral]]
    The destruction of Kempfa Town, the impact on the Windermere Territory, and the losses of the Church—ultimately, these were all just side dishes. Even unsealing Cayetana from the seal was only to make his plan grander and more perfect this time. [[6440 旁白 neutral]]
    But now it seemed a bit too perfect. To avoid failure, he had to complete the core problem of this "exam" early, which was his promise to the three great demon lords: to capture and enthrall a Saintess. [[6441 旁白 neutral]]
    Arriving before the inverted cross, Vlad no longer had the mood to admire the Saintess's beauty. He raised his sword, and the blade swiftly grazed the girl's fair wrist twice. Immediately, two linear wounds opened, and the girl's blood continuously dripped down like a mountain spring... [[6442 旁白 neutral]]
    The two streams of blood dripped directly onto the ritual matrix carved into the altar beneath her. The matrix patterns and lines were pre-carved grooves, and the blood dripped perfectly into the grooves, guided along their direction, eventually filling the entire ritual matrix and flowing to Vlad's feet. [[6443 旁白 neutral]]
    The silver-haired, handsome, and eerie man crouched down and extended his own hand, cutting his wrist with the sword. Unlike the first embrace of Avril, where he only used a drop of blood squeezed from his fingertip, enthralling a Saintess required much more blood from him, but compared to the outcome, it was all worth it. [[6444 旁白 neutral]]
    When the blood clan's blood dripped into the normal blood flowing from the girl, the two bloods merged. Human blood was brighter, and blood clan blood was darker. As blood merged with blood, wisps of black energy began to emerge from the ancient sacrificial ritual array, integrating into the unpolluted blood. [[6445 旁白 neutral]]
    Avril still stood silently behind him, like a docile maid awaiting orders, watching as the polluted blood flowed back into the young lady's wounds and entered her body... [[6446 旁白 neutral]]
    The first embrace ritual had begun. As long as all the normal blood in the young lady's body was completely merged and corrupted, she would completely lose her human identity and inevitably become a member of the vampires. [[6447 旁白 neutral]]
    But, but this was the goal! [[6448 旁白 neutral]]
    This was Vlad's goal, and it was also her own goal. [[6449 旁白 neutral]]
    The difference was that Vlad wanted a Saintess bride personally enthralled by him, while she was gambling—gambling on an opportunity, gambling on a possibility, gambling on that one-in-ten-thousand chance... [[6450 旁白 neutral]]
    She was gambling, and the young lady was also gambling. [[6451 旁白 neutral]]
    While Vlad's attention was mostly focused on the first embrace ritual, Avril's peripheral vision glanced at the original battlefield, which had been entirely occupied by the two elemental storms of blood and water. Nothing could be seen except the raging elements... [[6452 旁白 neutral]]
    God of Wind, please look upon this place. May you show mercy this time. [[6453 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    ... [[6454 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[6455 旁白 neutral]]
    The clear blue separated the raging and turbulent outside world, leaving only the two of them and the core of the storm, looking at each other calmly. [[6456 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ugh..." [[6457 卡瑞塔娜 fearful]]
    Crimson blood converged towards the center, struggling to restore a female figure. Her cherry-colored hair was disheveled. Cayetana's opened eyes, her crimson pupils, were not as bright as before, but rather dim and weak. [[6458 旁白 fearful]]
    "Cough cough!" [[6459 卡瑞塔娜 neutral]]
    Her body suddenly hunched over, and she coughed twice. When she removed the hand covering her mouth, there wasn't even a trace of blood on her palm. [[6460 旁白 fearful]]
    Was this body so weak that she couldn't even cough up blood? [[6461 旁白 fearful]]
    How pathetic... [[6462 卡瑞塔娜 sad]]
    The proud blood clan girl couldn't help but mock herself internally. At the same time, she looked up at the girl who, besides herself, had made her pay such a high price and whom she had to approach no matter what. [[6463 旁白 neutral]]
    However, her current state seemed a bit special. Her aura was as weak and chaotic as her own, but her eyes, with their teardrop-patterned pupils, remained as calm as an ancient well. [[6464 旁白 neutral]]
    "Now, can you tell me your name?" [[6465 卡瑞塔娜 neutral]]
    "...Lobelia." [[6466 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
