Chapter 30: Reset 30 - The First Saintess [[1732 旁白 neutral]]
A holy light illuminated the darkness ahead, but it wasn't blinding. [[1733 旁白 neutral]]
In a daze, his consciousness felt as if it had been pulled into another world. His vision went from blurry to clear, until he could see his surroundings perfectly. [[1734 旁白 surprised]]
Blue-green spots of light from stained-glass windows moved across the walls. Seven spiral stone pillars held up the grand hall. Looking closely, each pillar was carved with ancient, holy symbols. The light inside the sacred cathedral was hazy and soft, making it feel unreal. [[1735 旁白 neutral]]
Where am I? [[1736 塞伦安 surprised]]
The question appeared in Selen An's mind, but he quickly pushed it aside. His attention was drawn to something else: at the front of the grand cathedral was an altar, and on the altar stood a giant statue. [[1737 旁白 neutral]]
The statue was huge and solemn. Behind it, three pairs of wings were spread out. Its arms were crossed tightly over its chest, as if protecting something. The statue was faceless. Light from the stained glass window shone on one side of the statue, giving the lifeless stone an incredible divine power. [[1738 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An recognized this statue. Or rather, as a veteran player, he knew every statue of the creator gods on the continent of Nephalem. This statue was one of the six creator gods: the God of Water, ****, who represents life and peace. [[1739 旁白 neutral]]
About the God of Water's name, Selen An wasn't joking. As a veteran player of the game in his past life, even he didn't know the god's real name. In almost all the game's texts, the God of Water was referred to as the "Goddess of Life," the "God of Peace," or simply with four asterisks (*). They didn't even try to hide it. [[1740 旁白 neutral]]
As these thoughts popped into his head, he was surprised to find he had somehow walked from the back of the cathedral to the front of the statue. He looked up at the faceless, mysterious, and solemn figure, but for some reason... [[1741 旁白 surprised]]
He felt a deep sense of familiarity he couldn't shake. [[1742 旁白 neutral]]
"How ridiculous," he muttered to himself. [[1743 塞伦安 neutral]]
"You've finally come, Mother." [[1744 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
Almost without warning, a warm and healing voice came from behind him. The voice was very familiar; he must have heard it somewhere before. [[1745 旁白 neutral]]
That's right, it was the voice that had suddenly appeared in his mind and influenced his actions several times. But unlike before, this voice was less ethereal and more gentle and motherly. [[1746 旁白 surprised]]
He whipped his head around to look behind him, and his pupils dilated uncontrollably. [[1747 旁白 surprised]]
"Holy crap, you're not human!" [[1748 塞伦安 surprised]]
Of course, Selen An didn't mean to be rude. He was just stating a fact in a dramatic way, because the one who had appeared behind him like a ghost really wasn't human! [[1749 旁白 neutral]]
Her skin was as delicate as water, her long hair as blue as the ocean, and her deep, serene eyes were so clear you could see a perfect reflection in them. She wore a blue-green fishtail gown that shimmered like a pearl from the deep sea. But he also noticed some unusual details—she had fins the color of stained glass instead of human ears, and pale gold scales dotted her neck and the edges of her cheeks like teardrops. [[1750 旁白 neutral]]
The holy maiden before him, glowing with a unique motherly light, was clearly not purely human. She was of the Merfolk! [[1751 旁白 surprised]]
He had never seen such a beautiful Merfolk before... No, something felt off. Wait, if that voice came from this Merfolk maiden, what did she just call him? [[1752 旁白 surprised]]
Selen An thought he must have misheard. The Merfolk maiden in front of him seemed to read his mind, and a gentle smile that was impossible to refuse bloomed on her beautiful, holy face. Her sapphire eyes were filled with affection and other complex emotions he couldn't understand. [[1753 旁白 neutral]]
"You've finally come, my child." [[1754 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"Ah, that's more like it." [[1755 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An immediately felt relieved. Although he didn't know the true identity of the Merfolk maiden before him, since she appeared under the statue in a church dedicated to the God of Water, and with the faint divine aura around her, he made a bold guess. She was probably... [[1756 旁白 neutral]]
"Just as you think, I am a devout follower of my Lord and your ancestor. My name is Sabella, the first Water Saintess." [[1757 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"As I thought... Wait, what did she just say?" [[1758 塞伦安 surprised]]
This Merfolk maiden, who called herself Sabella, was the first Water Saintess and his ancestor? [[1759 旁白 surprised]]
"You, me, this, that, but..." [[1760 塞伦安 sad]]
At that moment, his mind was a complete mess, and he was stammering. [[1761 旁白 neutral]]
A refreshing fragrance wafted over, and a slender, fair finger was placed on his lips. [[1762 旁白 neutral]]
"If your thoughts are confused, don't think about it for now. These questions will be answered later. What I can promise you is that I am indeed your ancestor, the first believer of my Lord in this world." [[1763 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
Sabella smiled sweetly. Her smile seemed to have a special magic that, combined with her voice, could instantly calm one's heart. [[1764 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An felt his head go light, and he nodded along with her words. [[1765 旁白 neutral]]
"So why did I come here?" [[1766 塞伦安 neutral]]
He collected his thoughts and asked Sabella politely. Usually, when a game character has a flashback or dies and their consciousness is pulled into a special space, it's for a wave of memories, and then they get a power-up. [[1767 旁白 neutral]]
After all, the magical girls next door followed the same pattern. [[1768 旁白 neutral]]
So, had his hard work finally paid off? Was heaven smiling on him, and was he about to awaken his bloodline power? [[1769 塞伦安 happy]]
"Because fate has brought our paths together. Because you already know the truth. If you hadn't figured out the answer, you wouldn't have done that, even with my power influencing you..." [[1770 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"An act is a choice in itself. So, have you figured it out, Selen An?" [[1771 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
Sabella's voice was like a stone dropped into the lake of his heart, causing ripples. [[1772 旁白 neutral]]
The young man lowered his head and looked at his palm, a bitter smile unconsciously forming on his lips. [[1773 旁白 sad]]
"Of course. I suspected it for a long time. Actually, this incident can't be called transmigration. It's rebirth." [[1774 塞伦安 sad]]
With a self-mocking laugh, the blue-haired young man looked up and spoke calmly. [[1775 旁白 neutral]]
"From the moment I woke up and took over this body, I never felt even the slightest bit of unfamiliarity. Even though I was in a game character's body, I didn't feel any separation or unreality. And all those feelings buried deep in my heart..." [[1776 塞伦安 sad]]
"Because I am Selen An, I couldn't help but feel guilty when I saw Anna. Because I am Selen An, Serenia's image was always in my mind. Because I am Selen An, I wanted to break free from the chains of fate, even if it cost me my life..." [[1777 塞伦安 sad]]
"The guilt, the regret, the memories that fit so perfectly with my soul—all this evidence was constantly telling me that I am Selen An." [[1778 塞伦安 sad]]
"Miss Sabella, am I right about all this?" [[1779 塞伦安 sad]]
The boy poured out the secret he had hidden in his heart for so long. Finally, he looked at the Merfolk maiden who had listened to his confession and asked bitterly. [[1780 旁白 sad]]
Sabella didn't answer him. She opened her arms and hugged the young man tightly. She let Selen An bury his head in her embrace, while her soft, white hands gently patted his back. [[1781 旁白 neutral]]
"If your heart hurts, just cry it out..." [[1782 莎蓓拉 sad]]
"Tears are the embrace of the Mother God. It's just you and me here. If you cry, you'll feel better." [[1783 莎蓓拉 sad]]
"So, go ahead and cry." [[1784 莎蓓拉 sad]]
She said softly, her warm embrace and words capable of making anyone let down their guard. [[1785 旁白 neutral]]
