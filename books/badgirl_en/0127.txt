Chapter 127: The Fall [[7560 旁白 neutral]]
My body, even my soul, was imprisoned, unable to move... [[7561 弗拉德 fearful]]
The moment the hexagram of judgment was fully formed, even space itself was locked down, completely sealing off any path of retreat. [[7562 旁白 neutral]]
At the moment of life and death, Vlad erupted with power beyond his limits. Bearing the immense weight of the "Pivot of the Seven Seas," he forcefully tore apart the seven towering pillars of chains, but his own body, unable to withstand the tremendous force, was left mangled and broken. [[7563 旁白 neutral]]
Nearly 90% of his skin was torn, and not a single bone in his body remained intact. Splintered bone fragments were embedded in his flesh. The powerful life force of the blood clan was helping him heal rapidly, but it was too late... [[7564 旁白 fearful]]
The witch's star flail was the first to pierce his chest. The spike at the end of the chain penetrated and shattered Vlad's heart. The unique nature of the witch's power greatly suppressed the blood clan's regenerative abilities. [[7565 旁白 neutral]]
The pink-eyed succubus followed close behind. Facing the fiercely struggling Vlad, the succubus girl gently pressed a slender index finger to her cherry-colored lower lip. A trace of pity showed on her charming face, but there was not a shred of mercy in her heart-shaped eyes. [[7566 旁白 neutral]]
"Really, what a waste of such a delicious meal. But then I remember your blood is soaked with so many undead spirits. On second thought, I'll pass. This lady is very picky~" [[7567 魅魔 neutral]]
Hearing that soft, seductive voice, Vlad subconsciously raised his head. Veins bulged on his outstretched neck, and his blood-red eyes burned like fire. [[7568 旁白 angry]]
"Satella, you bitch!" [[7569 弗拉德 angry]]
"How dare you conspire with humans to plot against me! Even in death, I will never forgive you, you lewd, despicable demon!" [[7570 弗拉德 angry]]
Clearly, the succubus girl's face and aura reminded the maddened Vlad of certain demons. With his reason burned away, he no longer cared if he was cursing the right person, simply venting the explosive emotions in his chest on instinct. [[7571 旁白 neutral]]
"Tsk." [[7572 魅魔 angry]]
The succubus, who had always maintained a seductive smile, uncharacteristically dropped her grin. She frowned in disgust, a flicker of anger rising in her desire-filled, heart-shaped eyes. [[7573 旁白 angry]]
"I don't know who this woman you're cursing is, but your words are unexpectedly... pissing me off!" [[7574 魅魔 angry]]
Her voice grew colder and colder, until the final word fell, filled with killing intent. The succubus twisted, and her heart-tipped tail shot out like a strange arrow, instantly piercing Vlad's throat and preventing him from making any normal sound. [[7575 旁白 angry]]
"Urgh-ahhh!" [[7576 弗拉德 sad]]
In agony, Vlad reached to pull out the black tail, but just as he raised his hands, he heard the chanting of the wind. [[7577 旁白 neutral]]
[Wind Divine Art: Ninefold Ring of Precepts] [[7578 旁白 neutral]]
Nine rings of wind, imbued with a powerful disciplinary attribute, clamped down hard around his entire body, binding his just-raised arms tightly to his sides. [[7579 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahhhh..." [[7580 弗拉德 sad]]
With his vocal cords completely destroyed, Vlad could only let out beast-like roars, making it impossible to tell if he was conveying anger or simply groaning in pain. [[7581 旁白 sad]]
"Noisy!" [[7582 西格利德 angry]]
Sigrid's cold shout suppressed the roars. After activating "Blood Sacrifice," her Wolf King Steel-Bone Rapier displayed unprecedented sharpness. Blood thorns, like living things, writhed from the hilt, wrapping around her sword hand and excitedly drinking the girl's blood. [[7583 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, sword~ Drink some more. May you turn this sin of greed into the sharpest blade to pierce the enemy!" [[7584 西格利德 neutral]]
Clang! [[7585 旁白 neutral]]
Then, with a clear sword-song like a dragon's cry, Sigrid's figure flashed behind Vlad. With a beautiful flourish, her fair hand sheathed the rapier gracefully. [[7586 旁白 neutral]]
Thousands of thread-like lines of blood suddenly appeared on the surface of Vlad's already-healed body. Blood flowed and sprayed from the lines. The man's wails intensified as he collapsed weakly to his knees, looking up at the sky... [[7587 旁白 sad]]
In the blink of an eye, Sigrid had struck a thousand times, each strike precisely severing the magic circuits and meridians in his body. [[7588 旁白 neutral]]
Wounds that would be fatal to a normal person were trivial to the blood clan. After all, a high-ranking member could regenerate their body from a single drop of essence blood. But Sigrid was using Wolf King Steel-Bone, and for a vampire, wounds from such a weapon were like a poisoned blade. [[7589 旁白 neutral]]
The severed magical circuits and meridians could not heal. He could no longer feel the immense power surging through him, only the searing pain in his flesh. [[7590 旁白 sad]]
This time, it wasn't just his soul that was damaged; even his most basic control over his magic as a transcendent being was completely lost... [[7591 旁白 fearful]]
But the nightmare was far from over. The praying saintess opened her serene, teardrop-shaped eyes. Ripples spread across her light blue pupils. She suddenly spread her arms, and a spiral of watery light condensed into the shape of a sword, slowly descending into her cupped palms. [[7592 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, a true sense of dread arose in Vlad's heart. His sixth-tier level gave him a certain sense of destiny, and this sense told him that the next blow would be the ultimate negation of his life. [[7593 旁白 fearful]]
He wanted to struggle, but it was too late. [[7594 旁白 sad]]
"Vlad Bathory..." [[7595 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Suddenly hearing his true name called by the girl's ethereal and divine voice, the sense of dread in Vlad's heart grew ever stronger. He struggled desperately, his instincts driving him to stop her next words at all costs. But now that Celeste was free from suppressing the curse with most of her power, her strength had improved qualitatively. For a moment, he couldn't break free from the wind rings of precept. [[7596 旁白 fearful]]
And so, like a death row inmate being led to the execution ground, he listened in terror and trepidation to the Water Saintess's sentence. [[7597 旁白 fearful]]
"I despise you." [[7598 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
As the last four words left the girl's mouth, the world seemed to fall silent for a moment. [[7599 旁白 surprised]]
Everyone was shocked by the four-word judgment—not because Lobelia's sentence was too light, but because, as high-level combatants, they could all feel the power contained within those four words, especially for a member of the blood clan. [[7600 旁白 surprised]]
The one who felt it most was, of course, Vlad. Just moments before, he had been struggling in a wild fury like a mad beast. But as the four-word judgment fell, he seemed to have been stripped of all his strength and sanity. The light faded from his blood-red eyes, and his head drooped mechanically. [[7601 旁白 surprised]]
"No..." [[7602 弗拉德 fearful]]
A single, hoarse, and ugly word was forced from his ruined throat. [[7603 旁白 fearful]]
Within her spiritual consciousness, inside the holy church, Cassandra stared at the smooth wall, but through it, she witnessed the entire event unfold outside. [[7604 旁白 neutral]]
Upon hearing Lobelia's final four words, even she, one of the most ancient vampires in the world, couldn't help but shiver. [[7605 旁白 fearful]]
"How ruthless... To be personally negated and despised by the avatar of the Sea of Life. This is probably the cruelest punishment for any creature with a physical body, right?" [[7606 卡珊德拉 fearful]]
She whispered to herself, but felt a pair of gentle hands rest on her shoulders, followed by a soft voice. [[7607 旁白 neutral]]
"No, this is mercy." [[7608 莎蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Sabella said. [[7609 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey, are you sure you're not just getting old and confused? To be despised by her is almost equivalent to having the very meaning of your existence denied by the authority of life itself. Isn't the greatest feature of the blood clan their immortality? So now..." [[7610 卡珊德拉 angry]]
Cassandra frowned and retorted, but before she could finish, a mermaid's finger was pressed against her lips, forcing the rest of her words back. [[7611 旁白 neutral]]
"A life that cannot embrace death is the loneliest, most sorrowful child in the world. Weren't you the one who said that, Cassandra?" [[7612 莎蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"I! You!" [[7613 卡珊德拉 angry]]
The duchess was at a loss for words, her face flushing red. [[7614 旁白 surprised]]
"To banish his soul from this decaying shell, to sever the curse of eternal life placed upon his flesh, and to grant him the end of a true death. For a sinner, is this not an act of mercy?" [[7615 莎蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Sabella spoke, her voice gentle yet undeniable. [[7616 旁白 neutral]]
"..." [[7617 卡珊德拉 neutral]]
Cassandra fell silent. It seemed that silence was her only option. [[7618 旁白 neutral]]
After all, she had indeed said such a thing, and before entrusting her body completely to Lobelia, she had seen it as the only salvation for the blood clan. [[7619 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking about it this way, it seemed she had gotten a supreme-class seat thanks to Sabella, while Vlad, though forced to embrace death, had essentially been shoved into an economy-class seat... [[7620 旁白 neutral]]
Looked at this way, that guy actually got off easy! [[7621 卡珊德拉 angry]]
No way. That guy plotted against me before and showed no respect for me, the daughter of the Second Progenitor. How could I let him die so easily? [[7622 卡珊德拉 angry]]
I'll find a chance to add a little something extra for him later. But knowing the vengeful nature of vampires like Vlad, he probably won't accept Lobelia's mercy so obediently. [[7623 卡珊德拉 angry]]
But isn't that just perfect? Anyway, after completely entrusting my body, I don't have to do the actual fighting. Being able to slack off and watch a show, Cassandra was more than happy to see the curtain rise on a god-level battle. [[7624 旁白 happy]]
If I'm not mistaken, Windermere, the God of Free Wind, is probably watching all of this from some corner, too, right? [[7625 旁白 neutral]]
... [[7626 旁白 neutral]]
... [[7627 旁白 neutral]]
And as Cassandra had expected, those despised by Lobelia rarely met a good end. [[7628 旁白 neutral]]
The writhing blood sprouts withered, the self-healing genes necrotized, and the fundamental immortal blood flowing in his veins became viscous, heavy, and impossible to mobilize. [[7629 旁白 fearful]]
At this moment, Vlad's immortal attribute was removed, and he became a being that could truly be killed physically. [[7630 旁白 fearful]]
He wanted to scream in terror, like a child abandoned by its mother, but with his healing ability gone and his throat crushed, he could hardly form a single complete syllable, no matter how hard he struggled to move. His desperate gasps only produced a noise like a broken-down bellows. [[7631 旁白 fearful]]
"It's time to end this." [[7632 安德烈 neutral]]
Awoooo! [[7633 旁白 neutral]]
The man's deep voice was accompanied by a lone wolf's howl. Having lost his immortality, Vlad shuddered at the sound. He tried to retreat in terror, but bound by the wind rings, how could his backward shuffle compare to the priest with A-rank speed and strength? [[7634 旁白 fearful]]
Besides, this was no ordinary priest. He was a special priest, blessed by the specter of the Wolf King! [[7635 旁白 neutral]]
In his hand, he wielded a weapon from the Wolf King Steel-Bone series, the most threatening to vampires. His buffs were maxed out. [[7636 旁白 neutral]]
The man leaped high, his white-gloved hand gripping the cold hilt. The gunblade's body shimmered with a pale, cold light, until the friction of metal on metal produced a bone-chilling ring. [[7637 旁白 neutral]]
"Amen!!!" [[7638 安德烈 neutral]]
Clang! [[7639 旁白 neutral]]
Before Vlad's widened eyes, the descending priest unhesitatingly plunged the gunblade into his slightly open mouth. With his other hand, he flipped a blade and drove it horizontally through his temples, piercing his entire brain. [[7640 旁白 neutral]]
With that, the two blades crossed, forming the cruciform judgment. [[7641 旁白 neutral]]
White brain matter and scarlet blood sprayed out. Faced with such a gory scene, Andre's eyes showed no mercy. He just calmly and coolly twisted the hilts, driving the blades deeper, tearing the wounds wider... [[7642 旁白 neutral]]
At the end of the blades, the inscriptions carved into the wolf bone were lit by the blood, and the undying Flame of the Wolf King instantly engulfed Vlad's entire body. [[7643 旁白 neutral]]
The Flame of the Wolf King, which would not extinguish until it had consumed the last shred of a vampire's flesh, was the werewolf clan's ultimate weapon against the blood clan. Now, against a Vlad who had lost his immortality, it was the final match to light the straw. [[7644 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, only wails could be heard, and the tragic, twisting figure, neither human nor ghost, struggling in the幽 blue flames. [[7645 旁白 sad]]
The tenacious life force of a sixth-tier powerhouse was still keeping him alive. He slammed his head against the light barrier of the hexagram, only to be thrown back with even greater force. [[7646 旁白 fearful]]
The flames burned ever fiercer, mingled with the howl of the Wolf King. [[7647 旁白 neutral]]
Vlad was finished... [[7648 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone came to the same conclusion. The outcome was obvious. Soon, they would witness the fall of a sixth-tier vampire duke. [[7649 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the struggling, blurry figure on the ground moved less and less, until it stopped completely. The undying Flame of the Wolf King gradually died out, leaving only a pile of charred black embers suspended in the air. [[7650 旁白 sad]]
But was it really over? [[7651 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia's gaze remained fixed on the "seed" within the charred embers. She didn't stop it, because the seed had already drained all of Vlad's remaining life force. Otherwise, the Wolf King's Flame alone would not have been enough to kill a sixth-tier being in such a short time. [[7652 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, he couldn't swallow his pride and chose such an end? [[7653 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
A sacrifice to summon Cain, at the cost of his soul's complete annihilation. [[7654 旁白 sad]]
A wisp of black smoke rose from the ashes, and then... the world changed! [[7655 旁白 surprised]]
An endless torrent of black smoke, appearing from nowhere, shot up into the sky like a geyser. The dawn, which had just begun to show its faint light, was instantly obscured by this black smoke. Unlike day turning to night, where stars and the moon still offered light, this sudden eruption of black smoke was so strange that not even the light of celestial bodies could pierce it. [[7656 旁白 surprised]]
Most importantly, this power was no longer confined to a small area. In a short moment, it had enveloped the sky above a large city and was spreading with unstoppable momentum, stealing the dawn from the next city. [[7657 旁白 fearful]]
The moment the black smoke erupted, the hexagram of judgment was instantly shattered. Three figures transformed into light and returned to Lobelia's body. Just as she was about to control the water to protect her teammates, she felt a strong wind wrap around her entire body like a blanket, helping her escape the most dangerous central area. [[7658 旁白 surprised]]
Her feet touched the ground, giving her a sense of stability. Looking around, although their expressions varied, Medea and Celeste were both safe and sound. [[7659 旁白 neutral]]
The red-haired witch stared in disbelief at the apocalyptic sky. Her throat moved several times, but she couldn't utter a single word. [[7660 旁白 fearful]]
Celeste's face was also filled with worry, but she was a saintess, after all. After a moment of internal struggle, she moved her feet, preparing to act. Just then, a lazy, drawling voice came from behind her. [[7661 旁白 neutral]]
"Well, what a coincidence. The weather is so terrible today. I didn't expect to meet such distinguished young ladies out here..." [[7662 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Could it be that you ladies are like me, rushing back to bring in the laundry you left outside?" [[7663 陌生男1 neutral]]
