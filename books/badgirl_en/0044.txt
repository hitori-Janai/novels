Chapter 44: Reset 44 - No Fight, No Death [[2507 旁白 neutral]]
    As the body approached death, the soul left its shell. [[2508 旁白 neutral]]
    Kogsa abandoned his body, transforming from a living being into an undead spirit. [[2509 旁白 neutral]]
    At that very moment, a brief loophole appeared in the restrictions of the [No-Combat Pact]. Unlike ordinary humans, powerful demons can still control their souls independently for a certain period even after their bodies die, wandering the mortal world. [[2510 旁白 neutral]]
    If Kogsa's soul had a chance to escape back to the Demon Realm, with the ancient heritage of the Demon Clan and their research into forbidden magic, it was highly possible that Kogsa could regain a new body and live a new life in a completely new form. [[2511 旁白 neutral]]
    However, this possibility was burned away by the flames of anger after Kogsa's humiliating death, torn apart and devoured by a pack of beasts. He did not choose to flee; instead, he chose the most extreme option: soul self-destruction. [[2512 旁白 fearful]]
    At the cost of his own existence being completely annihilated in this world, the descendant of the Archduke of Hell was determined to drag his enemies down with him to be buried on this battlefield! [[2513 旁白 angry]]
    Freed from the restrictions of his imprisoned body, Kogsa controlled his soul and leapt towards the sky without hesitation. Serenia, sensing something was wrong, clearly triggered some bad memories. Pale frost followed her sword's direction, intending to completely seal his soul. [[2514 旁白 fearful]]
    But after all, she had just been through a great battle, her body was weak, and the power of ice elements was not enough to completely bind a soul body. Kogsa's soul struggled for a bit and quickly broke free from its confinement, continuing to drift higher into the sky. [[2515 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing that she couldn't stop him, Serenia gritted her teeth and turned, intending to throw herself over the girl behind her. The damage caused by soul self-destruction was extremely special; ordinary defensive measures had no weakening effect on soul-based damage at all. [[2516 旁白 fearful]]
    If she used her own body as a shield to first endure the strongest wave of soul impact, Loberia, protected beneath her, would receive the minimal possible damage. At this moment, this was the only way. [[2517 旁白 neutral]]
    She didn't consider the consequences of doing so at all. The moment she realized Kogsa was prepared for a desperate fight to the death, her mind was only focused on how to protect Loberia. It seemed she even forgot herself that this was merely her first meeting with this suddenly appearing Water Saintess. [[2518 旁白 neutral]]
    That was the plan, but just as she turned, a ripple of azure divine water passed directly through her body, immediately followed by another emerald green aura. [[2519 旁白 surprised]]
    Under the ancient tree, there was no wind between her fingers, yet the girl's swallowtail skirt swayed greatly due to the ripples of energy. The power had just bloomed from within her. What surprised Serenia even more was that she could clearly sense the restrictions of the [No-Combat Pact] in the air had vanished, replaced by a much thicker, all-encompassing sense of moisture. [[2520 旁白 surprised]]
    The dry air seemed to become stickier. Loberia stood with her fingers intertwined and her head bowed, her sea-blue hair dancing without wind, and increasingly lively water droplets shimmered among her strands. [[2521 旁白 neutral]]
    "Loberia, you..." [[2522 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
    She was shocked by the scene before her. At the same time, an impenetrable water curtain had appeared in front of her at some point, cutting off her possibility of approaching Loberia. [[2523 旁白 surprised]]
    Hearing someone call from behind, the blue-haired girl turned her head, her exquisite profile revealing a smile that was both gentle and firm. [[2524 旁白 neutral]]
    "I'm sorry, Serenia, this time, let me protect you..." [[2525 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "After all, this is my duty." [[2526 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "No!! Loberia, you don't understand! Soul self-destruction isn't that..." [[2527 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
    Serenia desperately slapped the water curtain in front of her, her palms creating countless ripples on its surface. Anxiously, she shouted at the girl on the other side of the curtain, trying to make her come back. [[2528 旁白 fearful]]
    "Please trust me." [[2529 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    She said so, her smile still gentle, but there was an unexplainable bitterness in her eyes. [[2530 旁白 sad]]
    "I..." [[2531 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    "Trust me." [[2532 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    She said no more, only repeating herself. Feeling the gaze of Loberia's azure, teardrop-like eyes, the words of warning in Serenia's throat became stuck and could no longer be spoken, as if speaking them would hurt the heart of this incredibly gentle girl before her. [[2533 旁白 neutral]]
    Her subconscious told her that the best choice she could make was to trust her and respect her decision. [[2534 旁白 neutral]]
    "I trust you..." [[2535 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    Above the firmament, Kogsa's fragmented soul had flown to the highest point, which would be the best self-destruction location for a soul. The soul storm unleashed by the self-destruction of a Fifth-Tier Archdemon was enough to extinguish the life fires of all living beings on the ground from the sky. [[2536 旁白 fearful]]
    Under the shade of the tree, having received Serenia's support, the girl smiled brightly. That smile was no longer the characteristic gentleness and pity, but like the first blue rose blooming in early spring, splendid and dazzling. [[2537 旁白 neutral]]
    "Thank you." [[2538 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
    As her voice fell, the aura around Loberia finally stopped concealing itself. Thirty-six water patterns rippled out from beneath her feet, each ripple supporting a glowing divine water droplet. Within the visible water droplets, a deep blue halo emerged, revealing the illusory figures of past Saintesses praying beneath the divine statue. [[2539 旁白 neutral]]
    Their movements were identical to Loberia's at that moment. Crossing the barriers of time and space, the Saintesses' auras connected, forming a single entity, and the resounding echo shook the soul. [[2540 旁白 neutral]]
    An azure magic circle rotated and expanded around her. Pure water gathered in her open palm, spiraling around the silver-white holy sword. She chanted, she sang aloud. [[2541 旁白 neutral]]
    "In the name of the thirty-six martyrs." [[2542 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The water droplets that trembled from her eyelashes as she bowed her head, upon touching the ground, instantly triggered a chain of divine miracles—the cracked earth gushed forth endless pure water, instantly covering the entire battlefield and forming an immaculate mirror. [[2543 旁白 neutral]]
    [Forbidden Spell: Divine Water Protection - Mirror World's Grace] [[2544 旁白 neutral]]
    The moment the Mirror of Water domain formed, the existence of all living beings was reflected by the immaculate mirror surface beneath their feet. All shadows overlapped, until they were completely encompassed by Loberia's right eye. [[2545 旁白 neutral]]
    At this point, all preparations were complete. Loberia, standing in the center of the Divine Water Mirror, lowered her hands and looked up at the sky, until that flickering point of white light suddenly burst open, instantly erupting into a soul storm more dazzling than the sun. [[2546 旁白 neutral]]
    Under the shade of the tree, Anna lay leaning against the tree trunk, still unconscious. [[2547 旁白 neutral]]
    Behind the rock, the swaddled infant hidden in the corner stopped crying. Gentle water, like moonlight, enveloped it, isolating it from all external magical fluctuations. [[2548 旁白 neutral]]
    On the green grass, the beasts that had previously devoured Kogsa gradually stabilized from their initial restless frenzy. The water mirror beneath their feet was like a mother beast's licking and comforting. Even when facing a terrifying threat, they still followed their instincts, choosing to trust the blue-haired human woman. [[2549 旁白 neutral]]
    Just as they had chosen to attack the demons for this girl at the beginning, it was clear that this girl, who possessed the gentle aura of a mother goddess, would treat them with the same tenderness as a mother goddess. [[2550 旁白 neutral]]
    Beside the water curtain, feeling the mental storm that could tear souls apart, Serenia's eyes now only reflected the girl's back. Her skirt hem was already crumpled, and in the second before the white light was about to swallow her, she perhaps still prayed in her heart for that familiar yet unfamiliar silhouette. [[2551 旁白 neutral]]
    Loberia spread her arms, calmly accepting the arrival of everything. [[2552 旁白 neutral]]
    Whether it was a blessing or a sharp blade, at least within this domain, the only thing she could guarantee was that death would not embrace any living being within her territory. [[2553 旁白 neutral]]
    "May the water protect your soul." [[2554 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Her voice was annihilated along with the soul storm that tore through the air, until the world's color completely turned pure white, and even the lines of existing objects became twisted and blurred... [[2555 旁白 neutral]]
    So dizzy, consciousness so fleeting... It felt as if her soul was about to be sent to heaven by this dazzling white light. [[2556 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    Because she chose to trust Loberia, Serenia was completely undefended as she faced the attack of the mental storm head-on. Amidst the world-piercing white light, she felt as if her consciousness was being sent to the other side. [[2557 旁白 fearful]]
    Just as she truly felt she was losing control of her mind, she felt a wetness and warmth on her wrist, along with a soft comfort that sounded like a spring breeze by her ear. [[2558 旁白 neutral]]
    "I'm sorry, little crybaby, this time I can only leave without saying goodbye..." [[2559 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    "Don't worry about me. I'm just going to do what I have to do, just like the wish we made in our childhood, so..." [[2560 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "I hope our next meeting won't be too far away." [[2561 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
