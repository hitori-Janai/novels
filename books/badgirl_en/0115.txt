Chapter 115: Metamorphosis [[6760 旁白 neutral]]
When the torrent faded and the blood crystals melted, the battlefield at the center, which had changed the world's colors, was instantly leveled for hundreds of miles around. Amidst the desolation, one couldn't help but marvel at the terror of forbidden, mighty power. [[6761 旁白 neutral]]
You should know that this was merely the initial collision, an unreleased forbidden spell. The maximum damage caused to the environment was only due to the initial turbulence formed by the two forbidden spells. Most of the power contained within them completely melted away before it could be released, as one element seamlessly absorbed the other. [[6762 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, in the center of the leveled ground, the crimson, as warm as a gem, gradually stabilized. Strangely, although only one of the two auras remained, neither the rich water element nor the crimson light on the field completely dissipated. The previous incompatibility of water and fire was gone. The two forces found a balance and completely merged in a peculiar way. [[6763 旁白 neutral]]
The dazzling red light gradually receded, revealing the victor's appearance— [[6764 旁白 neutral]]
A cascade of silver hair spread out, with a delicate cherry-pink gradient at the ends. Broken blood crystals gently adhered to the girl's fair skin, transforming into a fitting strapless gothic dress. Black and red elements intertwined and braided, all to highlight the long, beautiful legs wrapped in pure white stockings beneath the skirt. Her small, delicate feet wore heels adorned with black bows at the back. [[6765 旁白 neutral]]
The silver-haired Bloodline girl blossomed in the sea of blood. Her silver eyelashes trembled slightly, like Sleeping Beauty about to awaken with a prince's kiss. The moment she opened her crimson vertical pupils, an indescribable aura completely flowed from her body— [[6766 旁白 neutral]]
It was elegance, nobility, poise, and mystery. She seemed to embody all the positive qualities of a blood noble found in legends, making it difficult to forget her breathtaking charm and beauty after just one glance. [[6767 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps still unaccustomed to this newly acquired body, the Bloodline girl lowered her head to look at her slender, fair wrist and tilted her head. [[6768 旁白 neutral]]
Her skin seemed to have become even fairer, but it hadn't reached the morbid paleness of true vampires. That unhealthy pallor didn't appear on her, perhaps because other bloodline powers within her body neutralized and influenced it. [[6769 旁白 neutral]]
All in all, she had indeed become a Bloodline, but the aura she emitted lacked the coldness and诡谲 that normal vampires should have. Instead, she constantly revealed a mystery of the night and a gentle warmth of water. [[6770 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems the fusion was very successful~" [[6771 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
In her mind, Cayetana's voice suddenly rang out, her usual rising inflection still at the end of her words. [[6772 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you, Cayetana." [[6773 旁白 neutral]]
The Bloodline girl murmured, gazing at her palm. [[6774 旁白 neutral]]
After becoming a Bloodline, many related knowledge and information about Bloodlines automatically appeared in her mind. Some of it was instinctive knowledge from her bloodline, while the other part was actively provided for free by Ms. Cayetana. [[6775 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh, since we've become one, you don't have to keep calling me by my surname. It sounds awkward. Just call me Cassandra. That's my name." [[6776 卡珊德拉 neutral]]
After being assimilated, Cassandra's soul did not dissipate. Instead, it quickly stabilized due to the nourishment from the authority of this body. [[6777 旁白 neutral]]
To gain such great assistance effortlessly, regardless of reason or emotion, Lobelia wouldn't mind having an extra "lodger" in her body, provided they weren't too noisy. [[6778 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of senior Shabera, Lobelia felt there was nothing to worry about. With senior Shabera around, Cassandra would probably become much more well-behaved, with no evidence or reason, purely relying on intuition. [[6779 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't let your guard down. Even if you are the Water... ahem, Water Saintess, no six-tier demon is to be trifled with. Furthermore, even if you manage to push them into a corner, we cannot guarantee that a six-tier will not lash out when desperate, sacrificing themselves when they know they cannot escape." [[6780 卡珊德拉 fearful]]
Cassandra truly lived up to her reputation as one of the earliest vampires in this world, already well-versed in the tricks bloodlines loved to play. [[6781 旁白 neutral]]
"Understood." [[6782 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Just as the Bloodline girl was about to act, a slightly trembling and tentative call came from behind her. [[6783 旁白 neutral]]
"Evelyn?" [[6784 梅黛亚 neutral]]
Lobelia turned her head and saw the red-haired Medea holding a naginata, her eyes flickering as she looked at her. [[6785 旁白 neutral]]
"Mm." [[6786 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The Bloodline girl nodded, not refuting it. [[6787 旁白 neutral]]
"How could you..." [[6788 梅黛亚 surprised]]
"It's alright, Grandma Medea. I am different from normal Bloodlines." [[6789 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Saying this, the girl instantly moved in front of the witch at a speed she couldn't react to, and without hesitation, she snatched the Wolf King Steel Bone weapon, which Bloodlines greatly feared, from Medea's hand. [[6790 旁白 neutral]]
"Be care..." [[6791 梅黛亚 fearful]]
Before Medea could finish her two words, she stood stunned by the scene before her. [[6792 旁白 surprised]]
A Bloodline could directly touch the Wolf King Steel Bone without fear, and she didn't seem to have any discomfort or signs of being restrained. Is this, is this right? [[6793 旁白 surprised]]
Still dazed, she only felt her cheek being gently pinched. When she came to her senses, she found the silver-haired girl tilting her head, her other hand gently pinching her cheek. Her clear crimson pupils seemed to remind her that this was reality, not a dream. [[6794 旁白 neutral]]
Like waking from a dream, she tremblingly reached out and gently pinched the girl's fingertips. Her whole body trembled again. [[6795 旁白 surprised]]
Body temperature... She actually felt body temperature from the fingertips of a Bloodline. Although it was still much lower than that of a normal human, compared to the icy, corpse-like body temperature of ordinary Bloodlines, this was almost a miracle! [[6796 旁白 surprised]]
"Grandma Medea, now, do you believe me?" [[6797 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Of course." [[6798 梅黛亚 happy]]
The red-haired witch's voice completely softened, and her gaze towards the silver-haired Bloodline girl returned to its usual kindness. [[6799 旁白 neutral]]
"I never thought you would have such power. It's truly a miracle..." [[6800 梅黛亚 happy]]
"Grandma Medea, time is of the essence now. I need all the Wolf King Steel Bone weapons so I can nip the last disaster in the bud." [[6801 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Medea didn't say another word and directly summoned the pure white coffin from before. At the same time, she took one of the Bloodline girl's hands. [[6802 旁白 neutral]]
"Count me in. I know that in a battle of that level, a five-tier combat power might not be of much help, but this concerns the Bloodlines. It involves the responsibility of my clan. No matter what, I must witness this moment with my own eyes." [[6803 梅黛亚 neutral]]
The girl didn't answer, only nodded. [[6804 旁白 neutral]]
On the altar, Vlad looked at the two who had almost teleported to his territory. His face still maintained a "leisurely and carefree" expression, as if the little "accident" that had exceeded his expectations didn't bother him at all. [[6805 旁白 neutral]]
Completely ignoring the red-haired witch glaring at him, his gaze turned to the noble but unusually unfamiliar kin. He placed one hand on his chest, performing an extremely elegant noble gentleman's bow, his voice gentle and magnetic. [[6806 旁白 neutral]]
"Beautiful lady, I don't know how to address you?" [[6807 弗拉德 neutral]]
Lobelia had intended to remain silent, but Cassandra's voice suddenly echoed in her mind. [[6808 旁白 neutral]]
"Sigrid, that's how you answer him." [[6809 卡珊德拉 neutral]]
