Chapter 67: A Loyal Dog is Also a Dead Dog [[3777 旁白 neutral]]
"Your Highness, how did you get here? And where is this place?" [[3778 撒夏 surprised]]
After swearing his loyalty and accepting his new master, Sasha finally observed his surroundings and asked about the current situation. [[3779 旁白 neutral]]
"Isn't it obvious?" [[3780 塞伦安 neutral]]
The pink-eyed succubus spread her hands with a smile that said, "It's just as you think." [[3781 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the church's dungeon. Although this town is remote, even a small place like this has hidden experts." [[3782 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Your Highness, did you encounter that blond, blue-eyed priest?" [[3783 撒夏 fearful]]
Sasha asked eagerly and anxiously. [[3784 旁白 neutral]]
"You mean that muscular blond uncle, strong as an ox, with ghost-like shooting skills?" [[3785 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Yes, yes, your humble servant was ambushed by him, otherwise I wouldn't have..." [[3786 撒夏 fearful]]
The vampire's urgent expression seemed to be trying to hide something, but when his eyes met the succubus's mocking pink pupils, all his explanations got stuck in his throat. [[3787 旁白 neutral]]
"Useless is useless. The more you explain, the more you highlight your incompetence." [[3788 塞伦安 angry]]
Looked down upon by the succubus princess with eyes that saw him as trash, Sasha felt no humiliation. Instead, it seemed to awaken a strange fetish in him. His breathing quickened, and his expression showed unconcealed excitement. [[3789 旁白 surprised]]
"Yes, yes, Your Highness is right. I am useless, a foolish piece of trash, hopelessly useless..." [[3790 撒夏 happy]]
The pink-eyed succubus raised an eyebrow mockingly at the vampire groveling at her feet, who was getting excited from insulting himself. [[3791 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, alright. Even if you debase yourself to be lower than a rat, my opinion of you won't change much. But speaking of which, that priest does have some skills. Even I almost..." [[3792 塞伦安 neutral]]
The succubus girl stopped mid-sentence. Her "loyal dog," Sasha, immediately rushed forward to hug her thigh, asking with great concern. [[3793 旁白 neutral]]
"Your Highness, Your Highness, you aren't hurt, are you?" [[3794 撒夏 fearful]]
"Damn that human! How dare he harm Your Highness's precious body! I'll tear off his skin, drink his blood, and then I'll..." [[3795 撒夏 angry]]
"Nothing of the sort. It was just a passing thought. After all, no matter how strong a male is, he's still just a male. He will eventually bow before my skirt, caught by his desires." [[3796 塞伦安 happy]]
At the end of her words, the girl's voice carried a hint of pride that was etched into her very bones. [[3797 旁白 neutral]]
Sasha understood immediately. [[3798 旁白 neutral]]
That's right. Succubi were never known for their combat power in the demon world. They were famous for illusions, mental power, and curses. To deal with that brutish priest, as the noblest of succubi, Her Highness only needed to beckon with a finger to make him completely lost, or lift a leg to make the man who was like a god of death a moment ago wag his tail like a begging dog. [[3799 旁白 happy]]
This was the terror of the succubus race; they controlled the ultimate reproductive desire known as "sex"! [[3800 旁白 fearful]]
It was said that higher-level succubi had absolute control not only over the opposite sex but could even make those of the same sex willingly give everything for them, including their lives. [[3801 旁白 surprised]]
"Your Highness is mighty! Your Highness is divine!" [[3802 撒夏 happy]]
The "loyal dog" Sasha began to flatter her automatically. [[3803 旁白 neutral]]
This tactic didn't work very well on the pink-eyed succubus. She just looked down at him with weary, captivating eyes that held a faint trace of disdain. [[3804 旁白 neutral]]
"It's been a few years since I left home to wander. I didn't expect to run into you lot here, and to be beaten so badly by a mere close-combat priest. You talked about how powerful this priest was, but I took over the entire church so easily..." [[3805 塞伦安 angry]]
Sasha gradually noticed something was wrong with the girl's words, and his heart grew heavy. [[3806 旁白 fearful]]
"You know, even a stray dog I rescue would wag its tail to please me. But looking at your pale, ugly face, I really can't muster any interest." [[3807 塞伦安 angry]]
"Sasha, I'm starting to think I don't want a useless, ugly dog like you. What do you think we should do about that?" [[3808 塞伦安 angry]]
The succubus girl aggressively lifted his chin with the tip of her foot. Her black high heel was like a sharp blade, piercing the flesh of Sasha's jaw. But compared to the physical pain, he was more afraid of losing this great opportunity he had just secured. [[3809 旁白 fearful]]
This was a once-in-a-lifetime chance. In his clan, even after centuries of selfless dedication, there was little opportunity to climb the ladder. Although vampires have almost endless lifespans, what was the difference between that and being a slave for life if you had no power or status? [[3810 旁白 neutral]]
To get this chance, both helpers assigned by the Earl had died. He had spent all his savings as a poor baron to mobilize that truckload of ghouls. If he hadn't been determined to succeed or die trying, he wouldn't have pushed for such a radical plan in the inn, against Gulpo's advice. [[3811 旁白 fearful]]
In short, these days, you even had to compete to be a dog for a powerful figure. If he didn't seize this chance, his future status would be lower than a dog's! [[3812 旁白 fearful]]
In an instant, many thoughts flashed through Sasha's mind. He racked his half-rotten brain, and finally, as if he'd thought of something, he shouted eagerly like he was presenting a treasure. [[3813 旁白 happy]]
"Princess, Your Highness, you can't abandon me! I have value, great value! I can connect you with Duke Vlad and get you involved in your mother's grand schemes ahead of time!" [[3814 撒夏 fearful]]
"If that's not enough, I also know a lot of internal intelligence about the vampire clan, no, not just the vampires! With the information I have, you can gain more benefits, attract the attention of more powerful demons, and even make your mother see you in a new light!" [[3815 撒夏 happy]]
Watching the "loyal dog" at her feet frantically spill everything he knew, a trace of interest finally appeared in the succubus girl's pink, heart-shaped eyes. [[3816 旁白 neutral]]
She sat down on the only chair in the dungeon, crossed her legs, and propped her chin on her hand, speaking in a lazy and wanton manner. [[3817 旁白 neutral]]
"Tell me what you know. Remember to stick to the important parts, my time is very precious." [[3818 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Yes, yes!" [[3819 撒夏 happy]]
Sasha's eyes lit up as if he had grasped a lifeline. [[3820 旁白 happy]]
After more than half an hour of presenting his intelligence, the succubus girl finally had a general idea of the situation. [[3821 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, I see. So your purpose in coming to this town was to occupy it. You planned to sneak in under the cover of a merchant caravan, and then use the night to gradually take over the town, turning all the residents into blood slaves under your control. Finally, you would gather all your forces to besiege the church..." [[3822 塞伦安 neutral]]
"And five days after your arrival, regardless of whether the plan succeeded, a group of vampires would lead a large swarm of ghouls out of a pre-marked spatial coordinate to cleanse the entire town. Am I right?" [[3823 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Yes... yes... These were the orders from the Earl of Roses..." [[3824 撒夏 fearful]]
After talking for so long, Sasha felt hot all over. If it weren't for the noble succubus princess in front of him, he would have torn off all his clothes to cool down. [[3825 旁白 neutral]]
"So, it seems the Earl of Roses ordered you to do this. And the one who ordered the Earl of Roses must be Duke Vlad, right? This is what you meant by connecting me with Duke Vlad." [[3826 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Yes..." [[3827 撒夏 fearful]]
Sasha clutched his increasingly hot lower abdomen, his pale face turning a rare shade of red. He had actually played a small trick by not mentioning the seal beneath the church. He wanted to keep some information for himself, in case the princess asked him for more inside details later and he had nothing to offer. [[3828 旁白 neutral]]
But none of that mattered anymore... [[3829 旁白 neutral]]
For the succubus girl sitting on the chair. [[3830 旁白 neutral]]
She squinted at the "loyal dog" curled up like a cooked shrimp. [[3831 旁白 neutral]]
"You just got... hard, didn't you?" [[3832 塞伦安 angry]]
"No, Your Highness, I...!" [[3833 撒夏 surprised]]
The dull sound of a sharp object piercing flesh instantly cooled the lust-filled, hot dungeon. Sasha felt the warmth leave his feverish body, his blood-red pupils trembling in disbelief. [[3834 旁白 fearful]]
"Your... Highness..." [[3835 撒夏 sad]]
The girl's sharp claws had pierced his chest, her five fingers accurately gripping his heart. [[3836 旁白 neutral]]
The succubus girl, who had struck like a ghost, showed no pity in her eyes. She licked the few drops of blood that had splattered on her cheek, her narrowed eyes flashing with a dangerous light. [[3837 旁白 angry]]
"A dog that dares to get aroused by its master is not a dog worth keeping." [[3838 塞伦安 angry]]
"Splat!" [[3839 旁白 neutral]]
With another explosive squelch of flesh and blood, the succubus crushed the vampire's heart and slowly withdrew her blood-soaked arm from his body. [[3840 旁白 neutral]]
