Chapter 5: Reset 5 - Is This Really the End? [[240 旁白 fearful]]
"Tsk, tsk, tsk... so decisive, using your life as a bargaining chip without a second thought. If it weren't for the scent of the Succubus Seed on you, I would've thought the young master before me had been replaced." [[241 玛拉 neutral]]
The woman before him covered her mouth and chuckled softly, her movements alluring. The small, fleshy wings on her back fluttered with joy. [[242 旁白 neutral]]
"Actually, what I'm most curious about now, Young Master, is how you discovered me?" [[243 玛拉 neutral]]
"My disguise fooled so many people, and with your intelligence, Young Master, you should have been one of them..." [[244 玛拉 neutral]]
At this, she couldn't help but let out another chuckle. [[245 旁白 neutral]]
"But now it seems you were hiding your true skills, Young Master. Such a clever boy. Your change makes me want to speed up the plan." [[246 玛拉 happy]]
No, it wasn't about hiding skills, the person inside had simply been swapped out. [[247 塞伦安 neutral]]
She swayed her tempting figure, but Selen An, his heart filled with fear, was in no mood to appreciate the view before him. [[248 旁白 fearful]]
"Come now, Young Master. In my hands, there won't be a trace of pain." [[249 玛拉 neutral]]
She reached out as if to caress the young man's face, but Selen An instinctively dodged away. [[250 旁白 neutral]]
"I won't believe anything you say! Get out of my way!" [[251 塞伦安 angry]]
He shouted coldly, both to intimidate his enemy and to bolster what little courage he had. [[252 旁白 neutral]]
"So fierce? You'd better think this through. You have to go through this one way or another. If those trolls handle it, they aren't gentle, and it will be very painful at the start." [[253 玛拉 neutral]]
"I'm different. Big sister knows men best. I'll help you shed this stinking human skin comfortably and transform into a noble Succubus!" [[254 玛拉 happy]]
At this moment, she was like a fanatical preacher. Unfortunately, she wasn't preaching about God or any creator, but trying to drag someone into an endless hell of desire. [[255 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An didn't speak, just glared at her fiercely. [[256 旁白 neutral]]
Mara saw that the hand he used to grip the glass shard was trembling nonstop, and the mockery and desire in her eyes grew stronger. [[257 旁白 neutral]]
"Are you refusing because you're afraid?" [[258 玛拉 neutral]]
"Young Master, why be afraid? Desire is the nature of life. If you fear desire, life cannot continue." [[259 玛拉 neutral]]
Perhaps Selen An's actions had stirred some memory in her, as the succubus suddenly began to preach her philosophy with a fanatical expression. [[260 旁白 neutral]]
"Seeing you, Young Master, is like seeing my former self. I was once just like you, indoctrinated by the Church's teachings, viewing the Demon Clan as a great evil. I once swore to dedicate my entire life to the god I believed in, but what happened in the end?" [[261 玛拉 sad]]
Mara looked at her own rejuvenated skin with admiration, the tide of desire swirling in her deep cyan eyes. [[262 旁白 neutral]]
"Old age, sickness, oppression... I prayed day and night, sacrificing my youth and my life, but all I got in return was this despairing treatment, haha..." [[263 玛拉 sad]]
"Devout faith weighs less than a few rotten copper coins on the world's scales. Our so-called temperance and suppressed desires are just ways for the powerful to rule us better. They exploit, they oppress, they feast on the blood of their own kind and indulge in pleasure!" [[264 玛拉 angry]]
"The compensation for my child's death in battle became a bargaining chip for those nobles to play with women in brothels. My sacrificed youth and the tears I shed fell to the dust without making a single ripple!" [[265 玛拉 angry]]
She suddenly moved extremely close, slapping the glass shard from Selen An's hand with one of her own and tightly gripping his neck with the other, lifting him up. [[266 旁白 surprised]]
Selen An kicked his legs desperately, struggling, but the pain of suffocation prevented him from letting out even the slightest groan. [[267 旁白 fearful]]
"Why fear desire? It should be a blessing of life that we embrace with open arms. Look, Young Master, the youth that once faded from me has now returned after embracing pleasure!" [[268 玛拉 happy]]
"I am no longer that weak and useless nun, but a Succubus, nobler than any of you aristocrats! This is the power of desire. Don't try to resist it; you must accept it..." [[269 玛拉 happy]]
"The Church has so many missionaries every year, working tirelessly. Many dedicate their entire lives, but there's one desire they can't forbid: the desire for money." [[270 玛拉 neutral]]
"Humans subconsciously think that with money, they can satisfy all desires. But in their ignorance, they are still trapped by the Church. Truly enjoying desire isn't just about exchange; it's about abandoning everything to embrace desire itself. And everyone who understands this truth chooses, without exception, to find their new life in demonic corruption!" [[271 玛拉 happy]]
"Rejoice, Young Master! Today, I will guide you into the real world. Embrace desire, for it is the mother of your rebirth! Accept desire, for it is the self you can never refuse!" [[272 玛拉 happy]]
As her voice fell, a power seemed to flow from Mara's hand on his neck into his body. Something in his lower abdomen ignited, and an unholy fire of desire burned through him. [[273 旁白 fearful]]
"Arghhh..." [[274 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An felt his consciousness uncontrollably sinking into an abyss, as if a pair of invisible hands were kneading his soul, trying to reshape it into another's form. [[275 旁白 fearful]]
The Succubus Seed was activated ahead of schedule! This old hag isn't following the script. This is different from the original plot. She's not waiting for the demon army and is forcing my corruption right here and now! [[276 塞伦安 fearful]]
Desire washed over him like a tide, relentlessly crashing against the small island of his sanity. [[277 旁白 fearful]]
At that moment, Selen An wished he had a strong will. But in reality, apart from being more patient and resilient than the average person, his mind was just that of an ordinary man. [[278 旁白 fearful]]
The flames of desire engulfed his entire body, the vortex they created threatening to swallow him whole... I-I can't hold on much longer! [[279 旁白 fearful]]
Just as Selen An felt he was about to lose his grip on his mind and fall, a blast of cold energy grazed his nose. The bone-chilling cold seemed to freeze the very blood in his veins, and in an instant, it cleared his head slightly. [[280 旁白 surprised]]
But what truly woke him up was the sharp pain of landing on his rear, as jagged stones dug into his soft skin. [[281 旁白 neutral]]
The pain forced his eyes open. He saw a severed hand, still connected by threads of blood, roll to his side. Mara, who had lost a hand, instinctively tried to grab his collar with her other one. [[282 旁白 surprised]]
But reality did not go her way. A freezing storm of wind and snow had formed a barrier of icy energy around Selen An. The moment Mara's hand touched it, a thick layer of frost formed over it. [[283 旁白 neutral]]
Realizing she couldn't take Selen An, she decisively retreated. The circular wall of fire she had set up earlier had long been extinguished by the cold wind. Snow began to fall from the sky, and the air temperature dropped suddenly. [[284 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An collapsed on the ground, clutching his neck and coughing violently. Noticing the change in the environment, he almost wanted to cry with relief. [[285 塞伦安 happy]]
She's finally here! The only variable in the plot. If my dear lady hadn't come, the next time she saw me, it would probably be under a few burly trolls in a demon den. [[286 塞伦安 happy]]
Although the unholy fire in his body had not completely vanished, the cold in the air seemed to suppress it. [[287 旁白 neutral]]
"Click, clack." [[288 旁白 neutral]]
It was the sound of high heels stepping on the wasteland grass. The succubus Mara clutched the wound on her severed wrist, a rare look of fear in her eyes as she looked into the distance. [[289 旁白 fearful]]
From within the white, misty snow, a graceful figure holding a sword emerged. As she drew closer, her appearance became clearer... [[290 旁白 neutral]]
Her long, silvery-white hair cascaded down like a frozen waterfall, its ends adorned with fine ice crystals. Her ice-blue eyes were as cold and clear as a polar abyss. Her snow-white saintess robe was embroidered with silver thread in snowflake patterns, and a translucent ice-silk scarf drifted with the cold air. The hem of her skirt was adorned with frost flowers carved from ice. [[291 旁白 neutral]]
The exposed skin of her shoulders and neck was paler than new snow, and a diamond-shaped ice gem hung on her forehead. The long sword in her slender fingers glowed with a faint blue light. Wind and snow swirled around her, forming a misty barrier of cold. With every step, an ice lotus of frost bloomed. She looked like a goddess, the very embodiment of winter. [[292 旁白 neutral]]
That was... the Ice Saintess. [[293 旁白 surprised]]
PS: The transformation plot in this book is a bit long. The female form will be fully revealed around chapter 20. Please be patient. After all, this is a new genre, and I'm trying a new kind of story. [[294 旁白 neutral]]
