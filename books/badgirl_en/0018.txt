Chapter 18 Reset 18: Death and Birth [[1102 旁白 neutral]]
With a creak, the open wooden door closed again. [[1103 旁白 neutral]]
Outside, she was the only one left. [[1104 旁白 neutral]]
An icy-blue, dome-shaped barrier covered the old wooden house. The barrier seemed unbreakable, but Serenia knew that under the attack of the black tide of demon cavalry, it would be torn apart like paper without a fixed magical anchor. [[1105 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
So, she drew her sword and walked forward slowly, facing the wind that smelled of blood. [[1106 旁白 neutral]]
As the Ice Saintess, she was not good at healing or blessings. This was clear from when she was inside helping Anna's mother give birth. If she were the Water Saintess, the child would have likely been born safely by now. [[1107 旁白 neutral]]
But she was not. She was the Saintess who inherited the bloodline of the God of Ice, a symbol of judgment and moderation. Her duty was to deliver judgment to the evil creatures before her through slaughter! [[1108 旁白 angry]]
The heavy rain hit the ground, splashing mud. The girl tapped her toes lightly and charged into the enemy ranks. [[1109 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the front of the demon cavalry crashed into the icy-blue figure, a fierce cold energy pierced the formation, tearing a large gap. The horses' hooves were covered in a thick layer of frost from the extreme cold. Due to the great momentum of the cavalry charge, the horses' frozen, brittle limbs snapped and broke. [[1110 旁白 neutral]]
As the front line of soldiers and horses fell into chaos, the silver-haired girl stepped forward. Pure, surging magic flowed into the ground, and pale ice thorns burst from the earth, piercing the green-faced, tusked demons who tried to approach with their weapons, sending flesh and blood flying. [[1111 旁白 neutral]]
The demons' tough, blade-proof armor was like paper in front of the frost Serenia controlled, breaking with a single touch. [[1112 旁白 neutral]]
The harsh, ugly roars of the demons exploded by her ears. Serenia's eyes seemed to be lit by a special flame, and as she looked around, her beautiful eyes left striking trails of icy-blue light in the night. [[1113 旁白 neutral]]
In just a moment, her ice sword had cut off the heads of dozens of demons. Dark purple blood sprayed from their necks and mixed with the rain, adding a cruel touch to the one-sided battle. [[1114 旁白 neutral]]
The battle outside the barrier was intense, and the tension inside was just as high. [[1115 旁白 neutral]]
At some point, the cries of pain from inside the house had completely disappeared. Just a moment ago, standing outside, the night wind had made him feel cold. But now, Selen An's clothes were completely soaked, not with leftover rainwater, but with sweat dripping from his forehead! [[1116 旁白 fearful]]
Anna's mother was in a much worse condition than he had imagined! [[1117 塞伦安 fearful]]
The thin mother had not received enough nutrition and was also frightened by the situation, which caused her to go into labor early. There were almost no medical facilities around. [[1118 旁白 fearful]]
In medieval times, childbirth was a matter of constitution and luck. Even noblewomen sometimes died from blood loss during labor, killing both mother and child. Right now, Anna's mother was in a situation that was like dancing on the edge of death's door. [[1119 旁白 fearful]]
Anna was still continuously pressing on her mother's stomach to help with the birth. The mother was too weak to push anymore. No matter how much pressure was applied from the outside, the baby's head would not come down. [[1120 旁白 fearful]]
As a grown man, Selen An could only stand by and hand things to them. He saw the kind mother's suffering and felt anxious, but he couldn't help her give birth. [[1121 塞伦安 sad]]
Outside, the battle was bloody and fierce. Inside the small house, it felt incredibly hot and stuffy, and everyone was sweating. [[1122 旁白 fearful]]
Selen An's heart felt like it was about to jump out of his chest. He was worried about the pregnant woman's safety and also stressed about the battle outside. But in the original story, he was destined to become a demon's plaything and had no fighting ability at all. [[1123 塞伦安 fearful]]
In other words, he couldn't do anything. [[1124 塞伦安 sad]]
Just as he was hating himself for being so useless, Anna's panicked cry sounded in the room again. [[1125 旁白 surprised]]
"Mother, don't sleep! Mother, wake up!" [[1126 安娜 fearful]]
She kept shaking the woman's body on the wooden bed, as if trying to wake someone who was about to fall asleep. [[1127 旁白 fearful]]
Hearing her voice, Selen An sensed something was wrong and took a step forward. He saw— [[1128 塞伦安 fearful]]
The pregnant woman was still lying on the simple, old wooden bed. Although she was still biting down hard on the cloth in her mouth, she couldn't hold on any longer. The whites of her eyes were showing, and her eyelids were drooping. [[1129 旁白 fearful]]
Even though Selen An was not a doctor and had little medical knowledge, his common sense told him that Anna's mother was not going to make it. [[1130 塞伦安 fearful]]
Anna was frantic with worry, patting her mother and trying to bring her back to consciousness. But she was also afraid of using too much force and hurting her weakened mother. She was completely at a loss. [[1131 旁白 fearful]]
For a moment, only the girl's tearful cries filled the room. No matter how mature Anna had acted before, she was still just a young girl. Her mother was her only family in this world. If something happened to her, she would probably lose all will to live. [[1132 旁白 sad]]
Just as she was about to lose all hope, a figure moved past her from behind. [[1133 旁白 surprised]]
She was stunned by the sight... [[1134 安娜 surprised]]
Ignoring the strong smell of blood, Selen An stepped up to the woman's side and pinched the spot below her nose, hard. [[1135 旁白 neutral]]
He used so much force that he left a bloody nail mark on her skin. But it was surprisingly effective. The pain caused the pregnant woman, whose eyes had been rolling back, to show signs of waking up! [[1136 旁白 surprised]]
But even though she was awake, Anna's mother still had no strength to give birth. [[1137 旁白 fearful]]
Ultimately, she was just too weak. She hadn't received enough nutrition and had suffered in this harsh environment. It was only because of her naturally good constitution that she had held on this long. [[1138 旁白 sad]]
Her renewed consciousness was fading as she fought against the pain of labor. Covered in sweat, Selen An reached out and pinched her again, even harder this time. Blood flowed from the nail mark. [[1139 塞伦安 fearful]]
But thankfully, it worked again. Perhaps it was a biological instinct, the will to survive, or a mother's devotion to her unborn child. [[1140 旁白 fearful]]
This time, she became fierce. Her beautiful, gentle eyes were filled with bloodshot veins, as if she was squeezing out every last bit of energy from her body. She gripped the edge of the wooden bed so hard that her nails dug into the wood, filling the cracks with dark splinters. [[1141 旁白 angry]]
With a faint, crisp sound, the pregnant woman's eyes opened wide in a pained glare. She had bitten down on the cloth with so much force that she had broken one of her own teeth! [[1142 旁白 fearful]]
Selen An broke out in a cold sweat watching this. She was being so harsh on herself for her child's sake. But it was extremely effective. Anna, who was helping by rubbing her mother's belly, felt the baby drop. She quickly looked down between her mother's legs and saw the baby's fluffy head. [[1143 旁白 surprised]]
Her body trembled with excitement. She pushed on the stomach with more effort while encouraging her. [[1144 安娜 happy]]
"Mother, push a little harder! I can see the head! Just a little more and the baby will be out!" [[1145 安娜 happy]]
Suddenly, the room became even more tense. There were three people in total. One was giving birth, but the other two were also at their breaking point, their breathing unconsciously syncing with the pregnant woman's, as if they were the ones giving birth. [[1146 旁白 fearful]]
Time passed, second by second. Outside, a river of purple blood was seeping under the door. [[1147 旁白 fearful]]
Serenia had nearly gone berserk. In less than half an hour, her Ice Saintess sword had taken the heads of several hundred demons, and the number of demons she had killed with chantless magic was countless! [[1148 旁白 angry]]
If Selen An had seen this, he would have been amazed. As expected of the Ice Saintess who symbolized judgment. She killed demons as if she were in a video game, cutting them down effortlessly, moving through the enemy ranks as if no one was there. [[1149 旁白 surprised]]
Normally, even a large group of demons like this wouldn't be able to defeat Serenia. But now, she had three people to protect behind her. [[1150 旁白 fearful]]
As long as she was still human and had people to worry about and protect, no matter how unstoppable she was on the battlefield, there would come a moment when she would run out of energy and be defeated. It was only a matter of time. [[1151 旁白 fearful]]
However, this stalemate was suddenly broken. [[1152 旁白 surprised]]
When the baby took its first breath of air and let out its first sound, the cry of a newborn, like a clap of thunder, shattered the brief standoff. [[1153 旁白 happy]]
