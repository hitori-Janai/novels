Chapter 55: Where's My Tree? [[3139 旁白 neutral]]

    While the demons' round table meeting was in chaos, far away in the Craigmore Wasteland – no, it should now be called the Craigmore Plains – a vast plain stretched out, shaded by green trees and covered in lush grass, a natural beauty full of life. [[3140 旁白 neutral]]
    Unlike four years ago, everything here had changed due to a war. The barren Gobi Desert was now covered in green grass, and dry riverbeds were filled with clear streams. Such a vibrant scene was completely a natural sanctuary suitable for elves to live in for a long time. [[3141 旁白 neutral]]
    And indeed, this suddenly appearing fertile land immediately drew out the elves who had long lived in seclusion in the Elven Forest. Suddenly getting such a large fertile plain made the elves overjoyed… and overwhelmed. [[3142 旁白 surprised]]
    A desert wasteland turning into a fertile plain was indeed an astonishing thing. Such a huge change naturally attracted the attention of many forces. Generally speaking, the first ones to eye this "fat meat" should have been the empire or the demon realm closest to the fertile plain. [[3143 旁白 neutral]]
    But unexpectedly, before the closest two sides could even mobilize their troops, this mysterious, long-lived race, which ordinary people might never see in their entire lives, appeared like divine soldiers descending from the sky, instantly encircling the entire plain. [[3144 旁白 surprised]]
    The elves, as the active party, did not abandon their usual "peaceful" ways to engage in blatant seizure. Ultimately, their lifeblood had moved here. [[3145 旁白 neutral]]
    Wendy, standing not far from the Holy Tree, gazed at her mother, who had been kneeling and praying to the Holy Tree for a long time under its shade. Unconsciously, her memories returned to the Day of Abundance four years ago… [[3146 旁白 neutral]]
    The Day of Abundance was a festival exclusive to the elves, meaning to offer respect to the great Goddess of Life and Peace. [[3147 旁白 neutral]]
    On that day, the elves would select the most qualified elven maiden from their tribe. This fortunate elven girl would, under the witness of the Holy Tree, offer a thousand-year-old ritual dance to the benevolent Goddess. [[3148 旁白 neutral]]
    As the most dazzling sun and the precious pearl in the eyes of the tribe members for nearly a hundred years, Wendy, the only daughter of Queen Lydia of the Elves, was undoubtedly the most suitable candidate. [[3149 旁白 neutral]]
    For this day, she made countless preparations: choosing the most suitable gown, consulting the oldest etiquette official in Emerald City, and even throwing herself into her mother's arms, asking her coquettishly about the details to pay attention to on the Day of Abundance… [[3150 旁白 happy]]
    To this end, she made countless efforts. She practiced day and night, dancing alone, tirelessly, in an empty palace, just to offer the best ritual dance to the great Mother Goddess on this day. [[3151 旁白 neutral]]
    All imagination was beautiful until that day arrived. [[3152 旁白 neutral]]
    On the Day of Abundance, almost all elves near Emerald City who could arrive that day gathered under the Holy Tree. Under the shade of the Holy Tree, Queen Lydia of the Elves stood with her back to the Holy Tree, gazing at her people and solemnly declaring: [[3153 旁白 neutral]]
    "We are grateful to the Goddess for leaving the Holy Tree to our tribe. All our power, lifespan, talents, and even the favor of nature are bestowed by the Holy Tree, and the Holy Tree is the root planted by the Goddess for our tribe. Praise the Goddess!" [[3154 莉蒂亚 happy]]
    "Today is the 5500th year since the Goddess planted the Holy Tree. Now, we gather here, hoping everyone can truly enjoy this sacred day, grateful for the Holy Tree's blessings! Grateful for the Goddess's benevolence!" [[3155 莉蒂亚 happy]]
    "Then I announce, the 5500th Abundance Ritual of the Holy Tree, now begin…" [[3156 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
    The Queen's voice stopped abruptly. She looked at the audience with some confusion. From the beginning, she had noticed something was off. Why did the subjects in the audience look at her so strangely? [[3157 莉蒂亚 surprised]]
    But today was an extremely important day for every elf. As the Queen, Lydia could not make any mistakes. She temporarily suppressed those strange gazes, preparing to smoothly complete her speech, and then send people to ask those strangely looking tribe members what had happened. [[3158 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
    The result was… more and more strangely gazing tribe members, until she saw Wendy in the crowd, her most beloved daughter, whose gaze also held a doll-like blankness. [[3159 旁白 surprised]]
    She finally realized something was wrong. Down below, seeing Her Majesty the Queen stop her speech, a tribe member finally stammered a soft reminder: [[3160 旁白 surprised]]
    "Your Majesty… Holy Tree… Holy Tree…" [[3161 陌生男1 surprised]]
    The Elf Queen frowned. On this important festival, successive Elf Queens would strictly demand themselves to show no mistakes, and she was naturally the same, not wanting any complications. But the gazes of her subjects and her own daughter were truly too strange, coupled with the continuous reminders from below. [[3162 旁白 neutral]]
    The Elf Queen finally could not help but be curious and turned her head to look. [[3163 旁白 surprised]]
    "?" [[3164 莉蒂亚 surprised]]
    "My tree?" [[3166 莉蒂亚 surprised]]
    "Where's my gigantic Holy Tree?!" [[3167 莉蒂亚 surprised]]
    That was the first time Wendy had ever seen her mother lose her composure so greatly in public. [[3168 旁白 surprised]]
    As for what followed, Wendy had no great impression, as she and her mother were in similar states at the time, both staring blankly at the large empty pit where the Holy Tree had originally been, their entire souls seemingly hollowed out like that pit. [[3169 旁白 sad]]
    The entire elven tribe instantly fell into chaos. The sudden disappearance of the Holy Tree was even more unacceptable to the elven people than the sudden death of the current Elf Queen. [[3170 旁白 fearful]]
    After all, if the Elf Queen died, the entire elven tribe might weep and mourn, but if the Holy Tree was gone, the entire elven tribe would go crazy! [[3171 旁白 fearful]]
    Wendy had no idea what she would do if she had been the Queen on stage at that time, and had encountered such a thing. [[3172 旁白 neutral]]
    Fortunately, she was still young and not the Queen. And Lydia, as the Elf Queen, was not a queen in vain. She quickly appeased the Elder Council and the many common people with a firm hand, and then swiftly located the exact position by relying on the royal bloodline's innate connection to the Holy Tree. [[3173 旁白 neutral]]
    Next, before the empire and the demon realm, which were closest to Craigmore, could make a move, a group of elves descended like divine soldiers. Several powerful elf sages led the way, using immense magic power and exquisite magical profoundness to forcibly carve open a spatial tunnel from the Elven Forest to the Craigmore Wasteland, thus gaining a step ahead and occupying the area. [[3174 旁白 neutral]]
    In the eyes of the empire and the demon realm, the elves this time completely changed their usual benevolent demeanor, like a group of "polite bandits" who seized the initiative and then surrounded this suddenly appeared fertile plain impenetrably. [[3175 旁白 surprised]]
    Of course, this action also broke the outside world's false claims about elves being timid, weak, and afraid of war. Daring to seize the "fat meat" that was almost in their mouths, under the pressure of the two major forces, the empire and the demon realm, these long-eared people not only lived long but also had an exceptionally martial folk custom! [[3176 旁白 neutral]]
    Of course, these were all external speculations and discussions. As for the elves themselves, hearing these comments, they could only swallow the bitter fruit with a wry smile. [[3177 旁白 sad]]
    How could they want to snatch food from a tiger's mouth? [[3178 旁白 neutral]]
    Their lifeblood suddenly ran into an alley in the gap between the walls of the two major forces. Could they just stand by and do nothing? [[3179 旁白 neutral]]
    The most crucial point was that it had been four years since the Holy Tree flew up and descended upon the Craigmore Plains out of nowhere. Four years, and how many erudite and exceptionally intelligent elven scholars had turned their hair white, yet still couldn't figure out how to make the Holy Tree willingly move back home. [[3180 旁白 neutral]]
    If the Holy Tree didn't leave, the main force of the elven tribe couldn't leave either. This delay and struggle led to the current awkward situation. [[3181 旁白 neutral]]
