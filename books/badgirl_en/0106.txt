Chapter 106: Resolve [[6266 旁白 neutral]]
    The pure white coffin stood upright, slammed onto the ground. The heavy coffin lid had the Church's cross engraved on its surface. [[6267 旁白 neutral]]
    This coffin was buried by Andre himself. To see his mentor off, he personally handled the old man's funeral and buried him in a grave he had chosen beforehand, shoveling dirt over him little by little until he was underground. [[6268 旁白 neutral]]
    A clear-sighted person seeing this style of coffin would subconsciously think that a highly respected clergyman was resting in this peaceful place. Andre might have previously thought there was an inhuman wolf corpse inside, but now the truth proves— [[6269 旁白 neutral]]
    Besides holding bodies, coffins can also hold weapons in display. [[6270 旁白 neutral]]
    "Wolf King Steel Bone." [[6271 旁白 neutral]]
    Under the moonlight, Cayetana showed a serious expression for the first time. Her voice lost its previous arrogance and leisure, becoming chillingly cold. [[6272 旁白 sad]]
    "You really are ruthless, aren't you?" [[6273 旁白 angry]]
    The appearance of the white heavy coffin made Cayetana stop fighting for a short time. Her blood-red eyes stared intently at the uniquely shaped weapons popping out from both sides of the coffin. Her extremely cold gaze seemed to want to destroy each of these highly threatening weapons with just her eyes. [[6274 旁白 fearful]]
    "If I'm not ruthless, how can I kill an immortal monster like you?" [[6275 梅黛亚 angry]]
    Medea said as she walked around one side of the coffin, reaching out to pull one of the long-handled naginatas from the weapons displayed like an opening peacock fan. [[6276 旁白 neutral]]
    "This weapon was forged from the melted thoracic vertebrae of past Wolf Kings after their deaths, all so that one day it could completely kill you, the Grand Duke of the Blood Clan who broke free from the seal again!" [[6277 梅黛亚 angry]]
    As she spoke, the red-haired witch raised the Steel Bone Naginata with one hand. Her arm slightly turned, and a cold gleam flowed across the blade, pointing the sharp end directly at Cayetana. [[6278 旁白 neutral]]
    This time, Cayetana did not mock or taunt as before. She simply quietly retracted all the contempt from her body. The blood-crystal skirt around her gently lifted, posing a dangerous battle stance. [[6279 旁白 neutral]]
    Clearly, all the weapons in this coffin posed a great danger to her. [[6280 旁白 fearful]]
    And Lobelia also recovered from her previous confusion. Wolf King Steel Bone, so that's it, so that's it... [[6281 旁白 neutral]]
    No wonder the old man's routine and habits were always abnormal before he left. She originally thought it was because the old man was old and his temper was getting strange. It turns out that from that time, he had already been preparing for this day. [[6282 旁白 neutral]]
    And the term "Wolf King Steel Bone" was not unfamiliar to her. In the game's subconscious setting, Wolf King Steel Bone was a legendary limited material beloved by players for no other reason than that weapons crafted from this material, second only to mythical-grade materials, were simply the bane of monsters with healing attributes. [[6283 旁白 neutral]]
    In many games, monsters with thick health bars, strong healing, and whose lost health after a long fight was less than what they recovered, were equally hated by players, and vampires had the most of these mechanics. [[6284 旁白 neutral]]
    New players often cried after being abused by an elite vampire before their levels were high enough, and even old players found vampires troublesome even when fully prepared. [[6285 旁白 neutral]]
    But if you have a weapon made of Wolf King Steel Bone, congratulations, from the day you get the weapon, you will become the strictest father to all vampires. [[6286 旁白 happy]]
    Special attack that breaks defense, extra damage, prevents healing, percentage-based execution, with both mechanics and numerical values, as long as you are fighting a vampire, it will be the handiest divine weapon at your disposal. [[6287 旁白 neutral]]
    "Teacher, are you... one of them?" [[6288 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    Under the moonlight, the cold weapons reflected a pale moonbeam. Lobelia truly couldn't associate these weapons with that flesh-and-blood old man who taught and raised her. [[6289 旁白 sad]]
    At least his hands were warm. It wouldn't be like this now, where just looking from afar made her close her eyes, unable to bear seeing the sadness called "farewell." [[6290 旁白 sad]]
    "Clang!" [[6291 旁白 neutral]]
    The symphony of metal clashes pulled her back from her sadness. The two sides were entangled again. With the addition of the coffin full of weapons, Medea changed her previous mage-like attack stance, each strike swift and directly hitting the vital points. [[6292 旁白 neutral]]
    In contrast, the appearance of these weapons did indeed have a significant impact on Cayetana. However, as a Sixth-Rank Blood Clan member, weapons alone were not enough to make up for the huge numerical gap. The blood-crystal skirt around her left deep crimson afterimages every time it cut through the air. [[6293 旁白 neutral]]
    Can't hesitate any longer... [[6294 旁白 neutral]]
    She told herself this, while all her attention was focused on the holy sword in her hand. [[6295 旁白 neutral]]
    The Holy Sword of Peace was not born for killing, its blade was blunt, but a blunt sword is not unable to harm people. It only needs to be sharpened, to reveal its edge. Gentle water also has an angry side. [[6296 旁白 neutral]]
    The skill description said nothing, but when Lobelia saw that string of text, she already understood in her heart that the true whetstone that could sharpen this sword was herself, the wielder. [[6297 旁白 neutral]]
    When the sparks of blood and sword clashed before her eyes, the girl opened her azure eyes, gazing at the clear, water-like blade reflecting half of her face. [[6298 旁白 neutral]]
    For this day, too many people had plotted and schemed, including some important people who sacrificed for it. [[6299 旁白 sad]]
    Today, although it was not a life-and-death situation like last time, with the "Non-Aggression Pact" as a trump card, her safety was naturally guaranteed. This time, he could hide and retreat, he could escape, but what about next time? [[6300 旁白 neutral]]
    Escaping won't solve the problem. Just like her past self, constantly avoiding external gazes and ignoring her own problems eventually led her to such a desperate situation. [[6301 旁白 sad]]
    If there were no afterlife, if there were no rebirth, she would probably have become the most promiscuous and despicable succubus, right? [[6302 旁白 sad]]
    The girl's fair hand was already on the blade. Although the blade was blunt, it was still a sword. As long as she pressed hard, it could still break the skin and draw blood. [[6303 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hey, are you really going to do this?" [[6304 陌生女1 neutral]]
    Suddenly, her own voice faintly came from beside her ear, but the tone was strangely unfamiliar. [[6305 旁白 neutral]]
    "Using a holy sword that symbolizes peace to create slaughter, your actions are no different from blasphemy." [[6306 陌生女1 angry]]
    "Let go, don't fight anymore. You are an envoy of peace, the embodiment of compassion. How can you personally break your own promise?" [[6307 陌生女1 sad]]
    Those words seemed to have an effect. The girl's hand on the blade hesitated, not pressing down. [[6308 旁白 neutral]]
    "Run away, this is the best now..." [[6309 陌生女1 sad]]
    "Why should I run away?" [[6310 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
    The girl's sudden cold laugh broke this monologue-like "persuasion." [[6311 旁白 neutral]]
    "Because it's none of your business." [[6312 水之幻影 neutral]]
    The phantom made of water calmly said, its face exactly like hers. [[6313 旁白 neutral]]
    "None of my business? No, it's very much my business..." [[6314 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
    "The fall of the Wind Saintess will inevitably trigger a wave of Saintess corruption like in the previous life. It's just that I was the first before, and now it's the second, the third..." [[6315 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    "So from the beginning, I had no retreat, from the moment I embarked on this path." [[6316 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The surface of the water phantom rippled slightly. [[6317 旁白 neutral]]
    "But using that power, the price..." [[6318 水之幻影 fearful]]
    "I'll bear the price, anyway, this is what the world wants to see, isn't it?" [[6319 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "After all, I owe this world." [[6320 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    As she spoke, the girl curled her lips, revealing a hint of sorrow not typically seen in a girl, but more like the bitterness a boy named Selen An would have. [[6321 旁白 neutral]]
    "You will regret it, Saintess who betrays peace." [[6322 水之幻影 sad]]
    The water phantom shook its head in disappointment, unable to persuade, and its form continuously dispersed. At this moment— [[6323 旁白 neutral]]
    "It doesn't matter, and let me remind you of something..." [[6324 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
    Lobelia suddenly looked up, meeting the gaze of the water phantom that had been contradicting her, revealing a wicked smile that should absolutely not exist on Lobelia's face. [[6325 旁白 neutral]]
    "To hell with peace! The God of Water symbolizes peace and life, what does that have to do with me, the Water Saintess?!" [[6326 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
    "Slash!" [[6327 旁白 neutral]]
    Her fair hand cut across the blade, drawing a splash of crimson. [[6328 旁白 neutral]]
