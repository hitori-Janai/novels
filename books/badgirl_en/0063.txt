第63章 Amen [[3574 旁白 neutral]]
    "Quick, quick! Release them all, that guy is coming down soon!" [[3575 撒夏 fearful]]
    The low-ranking vampire noble, Sascha, who was leading them, was directing his two remaining companions to quickly unlock the carriage. [[3576 旁白 neutral]]
    At this time, the full moon was in the sky, and the courtyard near the stables was terribly silent. Sascha had witnessed the entire battle just now, thinking it would be an easy victory. He didn't expect the opponent to kill three vampires by himself. [[3577 旁白 fearful]]
    That guy's strength was unusual. The two pistols in his hands were specifically made to kill vampires. Once a demon-hunting bullet soaked in holy water hit a vampire's vital part, it would immediately destroy the vitality of their blood, making them lose their regeneration ability. [[3578 旁白 fearful]]
    Thinking of that man's terrifyingly accurate marksmanship and his cold, frosty eyes, he couldn't help but shiver. More importantly, tonight was a full moon night, and that priest had not shown any werewolf form from beginning to end! [[3579 撒夏 fearful]]
    Sascha was not angry about his carelessness, even though his plan had caused the deaths of three companions, including Gulp. On the path to immortality, the weak must always make way for the strong. He only resented Gulp for being too useless, failing to even force out the opponent's werewolf form. [[3580 撒夏 angry]]
    However, the situation was not irreversible. He, who was blocking the door, along with another companion, immediately retreated after realizing something was wrong. They did not rush into the room to support their companions but abandoned their kinsmen's lives and went downstairs to seek an opportunity. [[3581 旁白 neutral]]
    The previous failure was just because the priest caught them off guard. As long as they dragged the fight into an open area, plus the "hounds" they brought, even a werewolf, rumored to be able to contend with vampires, would only be slowly worn down to death. [[3582 撒夏 neutral]]
    As he thought this, the carriage door lock was opened. A terrible stench and sticky saliva smell came from the gap. This group, considered their secret weapon for conquering the church, was released early. [[3583 旁白 neutral]]
    "Clatter~ Clatter~" [[3584 旁白 neutral]]
    The sound of leather shoes stepping on the wooden stairs clearly entered Sascha's ears. He cautiously turned his head to look at the end of the stairs, only to see a pair of gleaming leather shoes first appear from the darkness, followed by the fluttering hem of a greatcoat swaying in the night wind. [[3585 旁白 neutral]]
    The man's face in the shadow gradually appeared before the vampires as if a mask was being lifted: short golden hair, emerald green eyes, a strong muscular body hidden by a greatcoat, and not a single drop of blood on his white gloves. [[3586 旁白 neutral]]
    Most importantly, it was the weapon firmly gripped in his hands—a slightly unusual-looking blade that vampires had never seen before. There seemed to be no handguard at the junction of the blade and the handle; instead, the blade and handle were slightly offset. [[3587 旁白 neutral]]
    The smooth, mirror-like bayonet sword, like a magnificent work of art, reflected a chilling glint under the touch of the moonlight. [[3588 旁白 neutral]]
    "Seeing your panicked appearance, I suppose you've already tried to take hostages, haven't you?" [[3589 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre lowered his head, gently wiping the edge of the blade with his white-gloved fingers. His posture, not even glancing up and muttering to himself, seemed as if he didn't even consider the enemies in the courtyard. [[3590 旁白 neutral]]
    Sascha's eyes widened slightly, and he instinctively clenched his teeth and questioned. [[3591 旁白 surprised]]
    "You did all this?!" [[3592 撒夏 surprised]]
    "Of course. Although it's my first time dealing with you vampires face to face, in a way, creatures like vampires are just cannon fodder that inevitably appeared when I used to farm materials." [[3593 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre then looked up and casually pulled out a silver, wrinkled talisman from his greatcoat pocket. [[3594 旁白 neutral]]
    "Do you recognize this?" [[3595 安德烈 neutral]]
    The man smiled for the first time, but there was no warmth in his smile. [[3596 旁白 neutral]]
    "It's a Silence Talisman! You knew we were here all along, so you gave the talisman to those blood-food in advance and let them escape first!" [[3597 撒夏 angry]]
    Sascha's sharp nails almost dug into the flesh of his palms, but he seemed to feel no pain, only staring intently at the white-robed priest in front of him. [[3598 旁白 neutral]]
    Right! Only this possibility could explain it. Vampires' hearing is very sharp at night, almost covering the entire inn, and even extending to the outer 50-meter perimeter. [[3599 撒夏 surprised]]
    Within this range, if there had been a large-scale retreat of humans, the noise generated should have been detected by them long ago. But none of that happened. The weak humans disappeared silently, so when he went downstairs to take hostages to threaten a clergyman like the priest, he found every room empty. [[3600 撒夏 surprised]]
    He had thought that the previous battle sounds had disturbed these weak humans, and he had been too focused on the fight to notice the movements downstairs, but he hadn't realized... all of this was part of the plan of the thick-browed, big-eyed priest in front of him. [[3601 撒夏 surprised]]
    "It seems even if your bodies are rotten, your brains aren't completely empty. Not too stupid..." [[3602 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre put the Silence Talisman back into his pocket and keenly caught the low growl that suddenly appeared in the courtyard. [[3603 旁白 neutral]]
    He adjusted his round-rimmed glasses on his nose and looked with interest at the ugly creatures behind the three vampires, a teeming crowd of snarling, drooling beings like hounds. [[3604 旁白 neutral]]
    "It seems your reliance is on this group of ghouls?" [[3605 安德烈 neutral]]
    At this point, Andre also understood some things. The dead livestock in the town must have been killed by this group of hungry ghouls. [[3606 旁白 neutral]]
    Generally speaking, vampires who claim to be of noble blood and are in their right minds would not drink the foul-smelling blood of livestock. They consider this act something only done by inferior monsters. [[3607 旁白 neutral]]
    The monsters they referred to were the filthy, ugly ghouls. As one of the lowest existences in the demon world, ghouls are essentially blood slaves or humans who failed to be assimilated by vampires. Or, in some cases, low-blooded vampires who, when hungry, consumed the blood of their own kind, leading to corrupted bloodlines and a loss of sanity, degenerating into ghouls. [[3608 旁白 neutral]]
    If vampires are living dead wrapped in human skin and possessing reason, then ghouls are utterly monsters driven solely by primal desires and impulses. [[3609 旁白 neutral]]
    Vampires, as the superior race to ghouls, can only command them and cannot communicate with them. These extremely ferocious and pain-defying monsters are precisely the best "hounds" and cannon fodder in the eyes of vampires. [[3610 旁白 neutral]]
    Even if these monsters were the future they would inevitably face after being abandoned by their families and becoming feral vampires... [[3611 旁白 sad]]
    "Don't bluster, Father. Even if you drove those humans away, you only gave them a temporary reprieve. Once tonight passes, their fate will not change at all." [[3612 撒夏 neutral]]
    Sascha, the highest-ranking and most esteemed among the three vampires, perhaps influenced by some heavenly venerable from another world, instinctively frowned and shielded his two companions in front of him. [[3613 旁白 neutral]]
    "I can clearly feel your aura, a third-tier. In this small place, a third-tier is indeed not a weak combat force, but you are facing three noble vampires!" [[3614 撒夏 angry]]
    The moment his words fell, the three vampires simultaneously unfurled the bat wings behind them, and blood-red demonic energy surged wildly, collectively demonstrating the reality that they were all third-tier. [[3615 旁白 neutral]]
    "With three against one, plus a group of ghouls, do you think you still have a chance to live, Father?" [[3616 撒夏 angry]]
    Sascha, standing in the back row, smiled sinisterly in provocation, and the sky above the inn was completely enveloped by the blood-red demonic energy, reeking of blood. [[3617 撒夏 happy]]
    "Is that so?" [[3618 安德烈 neutral]]
    Facing the three vampires of the same rank, Andre's expression remained unchanged. His greatcoat flapped loudly in the magical wind, and his white-gloved hands still firmly gripped the bayonet sword. [[3619 旁白 neutral]]
    "Clang!" [[3620 旁白 neutral]]
    He finally moved, his two hands gripping the bayonet sword, crossing it horizontally and vertically in front of him, forming the righteous cross of judgment. The clanging tremor of the swords colliding sounded like the most resounding horn of slaughter. [[3621 旁白 neutral]]
    "Then I'd like to see whether you drain my blood first tonight, or if I tear off your heads in the end!" [[3622 安德烈 angry]]
    "Aaaaamen!!!" [[3623 安德烈 angry]]
