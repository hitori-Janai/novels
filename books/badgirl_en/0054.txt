Chapter 54: Round Table Conference [[3090 旁白 neutral]]
    "It's been four years, four whole years! Are those long-eared folks still refusing to leave?!" [[3091 陌生男1 angry]]
    Inside the dark and magnificent palace, cold blue demonic flames almost merged with the surrounding darkness. Ancient stone pillars stood guard at the center, and four mysterious and powerful figures sat around a round table. [[3092 旁白 neutral]]
    On the east side of the round table, a powerful demon, whose head resembled a skeletal ox and body was like a mountain, slammed his hand onto the stone tabletop. The immense force made the stone tiles beneath his feet tremble, and the hellfire swirling around his skeletal ox head swayed wildly with anger. [[3093 旁白 angry]]
    "Heh... Agares, why don't you calm down? Even if your punch shatters the entire palace, the elves occupying Craigmore won't retreat." [[3094 陌生男2 neutral]]
    Another cold and hoarse voice then sounded. In the dim palace, a scarlet viper opened its cold, vertical pupils, emitting a warning hiss. [[3095 旁白 neutral]]
    "Shut your stinking mouth! Andumali, you cowardly worm! All you do is hide in dark corners, hissing and annoying people!" [[3096 阿加雷斯 angry]]
    The ox-headed skeletal demon, whose head was on fire, was clearly not in a good mood. After hearing the other great demon's sarcastic remarks, he immediately retorted in a furious rage. [[3097 旁白 angry]]
    "Alright, alright, stop arguing, both of you. If you keep this up, His Majesty the Demon King will get angry." [[3098 陌生女1 neutral]]
    On the north side of the round table, cold blue flames outlined the demon's perfect waist-to-hip ratio, and her blood-pumping body curves were no less stunning than those of the contemporary Succubus Queen. [[3099 旁白 neutral]]
    However, as one's gaze moved up from this perfect figure, what they saw was not a woman's flowing long hair, but a head of snake-like hair that sent shivers down one's spine at first glance. [[3100 旁白 surprised]]
    "So what do you suggest we do, Medusa? Should we just let those long-eared folks keep occupying the buffer zone? You all know very well that if the long-ears truly decide to establish a long-term base there, we'll no longer be able to march directly into the imperial border. His Majesty the Demon King's plan will be greatly delayed. Who will take responsibility for that then?!" [[3101 阿加雷斯 angry]]
    Agares's voice boomed like thunder, stating an undeniable truth. This time, the other three great demons at the table remained silent. [[3102 旁白 neutral]]
    After a long time, someone finally spoke again. [[3103 旁白 neutral]]
    "We can only blame that fool, Kogsarth. His Majesty the Demon King trusted him so much and gave him such an important task, but he messed it up. Not only did he fail to bring back the last descendant of the Water Saintess bloodline, but he even helped them awaken. In the very end, the entire cavalry unit he took out was even completely wiped out..." [[3104 陌生男2 sad]]
    "If it weren't for his recklessness, which caused such a huge strategic error, how could the situation be like this now?" [[3105 陌生男2 sad]]
    The cold voice, like a maggot in the bone, once again permeated the flesh and blood of every living creature who heard it. [[3106 旁白 neutral]]
    "Speaking of the awakening of the Water Saintess bloodline, there isn't enough evidence yet to make a definitive conclusion, is there? Even the Church hasn't issued any news about the Saintess's return..." [[3107 美杜莎 neutral]]
    Medusa's fingers toyed with a small snake in her hair, and her eerie green eyes glowed with an ominous yet cautious light. [[3108 旁白 neutral]]
    "Then how do you explain the sudden appearance of the Holy Tree?" [[3109 陌生男3 neutral]]
    Finally, the figure on the south side of the round table spoke. His entire body was enveloped in a ridiculously wide, blood-red coat. Apart from his skin, which was as pale as a corpse, and his blood-red eyes that glowed in the darkness, his appearance was the closest to that of a human. [[3110 旁白 neutral]]
    "Don't tell me you don't know. All of you here may lack many things, but experience and longevity are certainly not among them. That towering ancient tree, which suddenly appeared in the desolate wilderness of Craigmore, not only instantly transformed the barren land into fertile plains, but also immediately attracted the elves who were hiding in the forest and unwilling to interact with the outside world..." [[3111 陌生男3 neutral]]
    "Based on the tree's abilities and the elves' reaction, it's highly likely to be the Holy Tree worshipped by generations of elves. Although we don't know why the Holy Tree suddenly appeared in the Craigmore wilderness from the Elf Forest, the only ones capable of doing this, besides the legendary Water God, are the Winterlein Saintesses who inherited the Water God's divine blood." [[3112 陌生男3 neutral]]
    Unlike the other three great demons who displayed either rage, coldness, or seductiveness, the powerful blood kin in the blood-red coat exhibited an elegance that was no less than that of the top human nobles. [[3113 旁白 neutral]]
    No, it should be an elegance that surpassed everyone else's. The nobles' elegance was to display their nobility and etiquette, while the elegance he displayed was a deep-seated obsession and madness. [[3114 旁白 neutral]]
    "It's all bad news, isn't it? The Water Saintess's bloodline has awakened. You guys can deal with this tough bone." [[3115 安杜马里 neutral]]
    Andumali let out two sinister sneers. He wasn't a fool like Kogsarth, who, after finally earning the title of a great demon through seniority, eagerly accepted His Majesty the Demon King's mission to demonstrate his power, truly a simpleton with only muscles and magma in his brain. He didn't even bother to check who his opponent was before accepting the mission. [[3116 旁白 neutral]]
    The Church and the Demon Clan have a long history of conflict. Throughout this time, both sides have had their victories and defeats. On the battlefield, swords are merciless. There have been Saintesses who slayed great demons and gained supreme human faith, and there have also been great demons who massacred Saintesses and established fearsome reputations. Yet, on the demon steles carved with these proud achievements, there has never been a single instance of a battle involving the Water Saintess! [[3117 旁白 neutral]]
    Doesn't that explain the problem? [[3118 旁白 neutral]]
    The clever and cunning great demons all remained silent and waited regarding this newly issued mission from His Majesty the Demon King. Only Kogsarth, this foolish demon who had just been promoted to the circle of great demons, eagerly accepted the mission, thinking he could successfully complete it and gain His Majesty the Demon King's favor. [[3119 旁白 neutral]]
    The result? He died without even a trace left, his soul reduced to ashes. A great demon died, and not even a shred of intelligence was brought back. To put it bluntly, his death was utterly worthless. [[3120 旁白 sad]]
    "Hmm~ one Ice Saintess is already a headache enough, and now with a Water Saintess added, surely none of you gentlemen will push this big problem onto a weak woman like me?" [[3121 美杜莎 neutral]]
    Medusa propped her chin with one hand, her voice filled with captivating charm. [[3122 旁白 neutral]]
    "A mere Ice Saintess is not worth mentioning! Do you cowardly and weaklings even have the face to call yourselves proud great demons?!" [[3123 阿加雷斯 angry]]
    "I'll handle the Ice Saintess! Even against the cold that can freeze time, the hellfire on my body won't flinch!" [[3124 阿加雷斯 angry]]
    Agares, whose entire body was burning with hellfire, raged in anger. [[3125 旁白 angry]]
    The other three parties at the round table looked at him as if he were an idiot. [[3126 旁白 neutral]]
    Who was talking about the Ice Saintess with you? [[3127 旁白 neutral]]
    Isn't everyone wary of the Water Saintess? You jump out here, scold everyone, and then pick a Saintess whose element happens to be counteracted by yours as your target... [[3128 旁白 neutral]]
    You acted so fiercely, we thought you were going to take on two at once, but you just pick on the easy targets. You're practically shaming the demon gods. [[3129 旁白 sad]]
    The other three great demons silently complained in unison. [[3130 旁白 neutral]]
    "Alright, let's not be unhappy over such a small matter. The Water Saintess issue will be put aside for now. Anyway, as long as His Majesty the Demon King hasn't demanded accountability, everyone will pretend not to know. However, pretending to be foolish doesn't mean being truly foolish. After a long time, an explanation will always have to be given." [[3131 弗拉德公爵 neutral]]
    The blood kin in the red coat elegantly clasped his hands, his voice calm and unhurried. [[3132 旁白 neutral]]
    "Duke Vlad, what do you mean?" [[3133 陌生男2 neutral]]
    A hint of interest bloomed in the sinister snake eyes in the darkness. [[3134 旁白 neutral]]
    "Watch me work. Under my perfect plan, I will capture a Saintess as a bargaining chip to restore morale, after all..." [[3135 弗拉德公爵 neutral]]
    In the shadows, the elegant and noble blood kin duke gently rubbed his pale skin with his sharp nails, a wicked smile curving his lips. [[3136 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is there anything in this world more interesting than personally transforming a Saintess into one of our kind?" [[3137 弗拉德公爵 happy]]
