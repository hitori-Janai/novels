Chapter 17: Reset 17 - A Stormy Night of Childbirth [[1045 旁白 neutral]]
Even standing outside, he could still clearly hear the moans from inside the house. [[1046 旁白 neutral]]
It was a mother in labor. Just from the sound, Selen An could feel the tearing pain in his own body. He subconsciously clenched his fist, his palm slick with sweat. [[1047 旁白 fearful]]
His heart pounded as if he were the one giving birth, not the woman in the house. [[1048 旁白 fearful]]
But soon, the feeling faded like a receding tide. A speck of light ignited in the dimness of the house, and an ice-blue magical power raised a hemispherical light barrier, like an inverted bowl, completely enveloping the wooden cabin. [[1049 旁白 neutral]]
The woman's moans vanished. All sound was sealed within the light barrier, and even the faint smell of blood that had been seeping through the door crack completely disappeared. [[1050 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An stood outside the light barrier. Without the sound, his immersive tension was greatly relieved, but his taut nerves didn't relax in the slightest. [[1051 旁白 fearful]]
At such a critical moment, right before their escape, something like this happening was never a good sign in any of the novels, games, or anime from his past life. He had a premonition... [[1052 旁白 fearful]]
Tonight, the turmoil would not end here. [[1053 旁白 fearful]]
Just as he had this thought, Selen An felt a chill on his scalp, as if a drop of water had fallen on his head. He touched his head but felt nothing. He had just started to think it was a hallucination from his nervousness when a second drop splashed on the back of his hand. [[1054 旁白 surprised]]
The young man stared blankly at the damp spot on his hand. Feeling the cool sensation of the third and fourth raindrops hitting his body, he slowly looked up at the sky. In the pitch-black night, there was no moon and no stars. [[1055 旁白 neutral]]
There was no light, only an increasingly dense rain falling on his face, his body, the wooden cabin, and the ground. The rain had come without warning, yet it seemed to be playing a kind of symphony, slowly pushing something buried in the night's darkness to the forefront. [[1056 旁白 fearful]]
What came with the rain was not just the coolness on his skin, but also... the trembling of the earth, and the clash of armor and thundering hooves approaching from the distance! [[1057 旁白 fearful]]
Inside the house, the woman on the bed was too weak to moan. Giving birth was an exhausting affair, and in medieval times, it was like a trip to death's door for any woman, let alone this frail and skinny one. [[1058 旁白 sad]]
The harsh environment, the lack of food and water... As a pregnant woman who needed nourishment, she had only eaten half a bowl of peas for dinner. Worn down by these hardships, she was as thin as a bundle of firewood, except for her swollen belly. [[1059 旁白 sad]]
Anna held her mother's hand, which was as withered as an old tree branch. Her eyes were filled with tears and grief, but she bit her lip, not daring to make a sound. [[1060 旁白 sad]]
Serenia, in her ice-like dress, tore a strip of cloth from her hem and stuffed it into the woman's mouth for her to bite down on. [[1061 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't make a sound." [[1062 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Although she had already set up a barrier, it was best not to make any noise at a time like this. [[1063 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice was frighteningly calm, but she never stopped pressing on the woman's stomach to help with the birth. [[1064 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, she had already sensed the commotion outside. She could smell the stench of blood from the demons hundreds of meters away. Normally, she would have either charged in with her sword or chosen to retreat and avoid a direct confrontation. [[1065 旁白 neutral]]
But now, a new life about to enter the world had disrupted all their plans. Helping with the delivery, she could neither fight nor flee. They were trapped here, sitting ducks for the Demon Clan's cavalry. [[1066 旁白 fearful]]
She looked down at the woman on the bed, pale-faced but still struggling on the brink of death. Without much hesitation, she quickly made a decision. [[1067 旁白 neutral]]
"Anna, did you remember the steps and actions I just showed you?" [[1068 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
She suddenly turned to the helpless girl. After her initial panic, the girl forced herself to calm down and nodded forcefully. [[1069 安娜 fearful]]
"I-I remember!" [[1070 安娜 fearful]]
"Good. Now you will help your mother by pressing on her stomach. I need to go outside for a moment." [[1071 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
... [[1072 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1073 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An swore that in this life—no, in this life and the last combined—he had never witnessed such a scene. [[1074 旁白 fearful]]
Dark clouds crushed the last rays of twilight, and the thunder of hooves rolled across the plains. At the edge of the horizon, a black tide surged forward! [[1075 旁白 fearful]]
Selen An saw the demon cavalry in the pouring rain, like giant beasts breaking free from hell. Each step sent mud splashing like black waves. The foul wind they carried was so thick it tore the rain into tattered white shrouds. The sparse bushes in the distance snapped under the pressure, like straws crushed by an invisible hand. [[1076 旁白 fearful]]
The entire land was turning into a boiling swamp, with mud splashing as if it were boiling. The stench of death from the cavalry was thicker than the rain, flooding his nostrils. [[1077 旁白 fearful]]
When lightning tore through the rain, Selen An saw the gaping mouths of the front-row demon riders. It was the entire army roaring in unison, their thousands of voices weaving a net that covered the sky and threatened to crush the small wooden house like a fragile seashell in a storm. [[1078 旁白 fearful]]
"Aaaaargh!" [[1079 旁白 fearful]]
The hoarse battle cry felt like it would pierce his eardrums. Selen An instinctively covered his ears, his body trembling like a leaf. At this moment, only one thought filled his mind— [[1080 旁白 fearful]]
Run, run now! The Demon Clan is unbeatable! [[1081 旁白 fearful]]
He was utterly terrified. His brain screamed at him to flee, but his body was as stiff as a puppet, his limbs refusing to obey. [[1082 旁白 fearful]]
A burning heat ignited in his lower abdomen. As the demons approached, the Succubus Seed inside him grew more active. If not for the seal Serenia had placed on him earlier, he would have likely reverted to the half-human, half-demon state he was in back in the carriage. [[1083 旁白 fearful]]
This was completely different from facing a single demon like Mara. Facing the demon cavalry was nothing like watching a game cutscene. The pressure and despair left only one word in his heart. [[1084 旁白 fearful]]
GG. [[1085 旁白 fearful]]
The demons had come for him, saw him as prey, and now there was no escape. [[1086 旁白 fearful]]
In extreme despair, a person can feel their spirit detaching from their body. Selen An's vision began to blur, but a cold hand on his shoulder pulled his consciousness back from the brink. [[1087 旁白 fearful]]
He turned to look at his shoulder. It was a slender, fair, and delicate hand. He was about to speak when he heard a cold, ethereal voice by his ear. [[1088 旁白 neutral]]
"Switch." [[1089 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Serenia moved past him, standing in front of him. [[1090 旁白 neutral]]
The wind and rain blew her skirt and loosened her tied-up silver hair. Her Saintess robe, embroidered with the Church's cross, whipped in the storm, its tight fabric outlining her proud figure. As the water neared her, it turned to ice from the pale chill radiating from her body and fell to the ground. [[1091 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the black tide of the demon army, she stood alone, fearless. Her ice-blue eyes reflected the "black tide" churning in the stormy night. [[1092 旁白 neutral]]
A pale, cold aura condensed in her hand, forming the holy sword that had slain countless enemies. With just one sword, she intended to stop a thousand-strong army. [[1093 旁白 neutral]]
"Go inside." [[1094 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
She said, her back to Selen An. The oncoming wind carried her voice into the young man's ears. [[1095 旁白 neutral]]
"I..." [[1096 塞伦安 fearful]]
"Go inside!" [[1097 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
The girl's voice suddenly became stern and undeniable. She asserted her authority as a Saintess and commanded him. [[1098 旁白 angry]]
"In the name of the Saintess, I order you to go into the house and help Anna." [[1099 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
"As for what's out here... I will handle it." [[1100 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
