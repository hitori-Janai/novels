Chapter 83: Nightmare [[4712 旁白 neutral]]
    After a night of intense fighting, the three returned to the town in the morning. [[4713 旁白 neutral]]
    Last night, thanks to Andre's prior warning and the nuns' strict vigilance, no disturbances occurred in the town. When daylight returned to this land, people's lives continued as usual. [[4714 旁白 neutral]]
    The nuns in the church all breathed a sigh of relief when they saw Father Andre and Isabella return. Some, who were more emotionally sensitive, even cried openly. [[4715 旁白 neutral]]
    Compared to ordinary town residents, they had a deeper understanding of the facts, so they knew how much risk Father Andre had taken by not returning all night. [[4716 旁白 neutral]]
    Fortunately, both returned safely, and even brought back a nun sister with an excellent demeanor whom they had never seen before. [[4717 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre, enduring his fatigue, refused the younger nuns' help and insisted on personally arranging Miss Moying's lodging and all necessary procedures. Only then did he drag his somewhat staggering body back to his room. [[4718 旁白 neutral]]
    Back in his room, he locked the door and didn't immediately lie down on the bed and fall asleep. Instead, he entered the private bathroom and slowly took off his pants. As for his top, it had already been torn to shreds by the vampires during the fight. [[4719 旁白 neutral]]
    His favorite white coat and precious vestments had all unfortunately perished, but Andre was not in the mood to lament over external possessions. After using water to gently wash away the congealed blood on his skin, the man gazed at his naked reflection in the water mirror, and a hint of bitterness and helplessness appeared in his tired eyes... [[4720 旁白 neutral]]
    Indeed, such forced on/off actions would inevitably bring some irreversible effects to the body. It was like pulling the plug directly from a computer without going through the shutdown process; the computer was easily damaged, and his own body was... [[4721 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps when they returned, everyone's attention was focused on whether they were safe and uninjured, overlooking the details. But as the owner of this body, Andre had discovered the abnormality early on. [[4722 旁白 neutral]]
    Not to mention that his skin had become whiter, now comparable to a beautiful girl like Isabella, his eyes and facial lines had changed to varying degrees. The sharply defined lines of his face had visibly softened, and his eyelids were no longer masculine and rigid, but had a feminine, charming curve. But these were not the main point! [[4723 旁白 neutral]]
    The most important thing was the perfectly sculpted muscles all over his body. For four whole years, he had trained relentlessly every day, putting in so much effort and sweat to shed his former weak image, finally achieving his ideal muscular strongman physique. [[4724 旁白 neutral]]
    But now? [[4725 旁白 sad]]
    After just one night of fighting, his perfect muscle lines, those bulging muscles, had instantly shrunk by a quarter. Four years of diligent effort and sweat, the fruits of his labor! Half of it had evaporated in one night! [[4726 旁白 sad]]
    Now he completely understood the painful expressions of his good buddies from his previous life who spent all day at the gym building muscles, only to find themselves losing muscle after excessive cardio. [[4727 旁白 sad]]
    In short, though he was still a weakened version of a muscular strongman, wearing his old priestly robes wouldn't give him that same taut, muscular feeling anymore. This current state was more akin to his previous pretty-boy image. [[4728 旁白 neutral]]
    After summarizing his gains and losses, Andre's mouth twitched violently. [[4729 旁白 neutral]]
    Damn it! [[4730 旁白 angry]]
    If he had known the Wind Saintess would provide support, would he have needed to take such a big risk to activate his divine blood? [[4731 旁白 angry]]
    The result was a half-transformation, forcibly interrupted, and the kills were stolen by the Wind Saintess. Isabella, with her wide-area attacks, probably got the most kills, while he, the "ox and horse" priest who fought from night to morning, ironically had the worst stats on paper. [[4732 旁白 angry]]
    His passion burned out, he put in effort all night, and in the end, the Wind Saintess had a 13.0 carry game, important kills, carrying the whole team. Isabella had 10.0, a gold-medal mage wildly racking up kills, while he, this wretched priest, got a 3.0 rating, becoming a "lying-down winner"? [[4733 旁白 angry]]
    And it wasn't just the low score; he also lost a good deal of his muscle. This was truly losing the wife and losing the army! [[4734 旁白 angry]]
    He had now become the otherworld version of Sun Shiwang. [[4735 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre looked at his disheveled self in the mirror, and for a moment, he actually laughed out of anger. [[4736 旁白 neutral]]
    "Damn it, I almost lost my pants fighting this battle!" [[4737 安德烈 angry]]
    Andre punched the water mirror, shattering it. The splashing water hit his face, seemingly mocking his impotent rage. [[4738 旁白 neutral]]
    After a quick tidy-up, Andre finally lay on the bed and got the sleep he had longed for. [[4739 旁白 neutral]]
    However, this rest after exhaustion didn't seem to be peaceful. [[4740 旁白 neutral]]
    A breeze blew through the window, opening the tightly closed window, pulling back the sun-blocking curtains, entering the faintly blood-scented room, and caressing the furrowed brow of the man. [[4741 旁白 neutral]]
    In his dream, Andre felt his consciousness being lifted by a gust of wind, drifting aimlessly. This sense of floating without a foothold made him instinctively uncomfortable, but suddenly, images appeared before his eyes— [[4742 旁白 neutral]]
    Amidst the ceaseless flow of people, a graceful figure draped in a gray cloak was mixed within the crowded stream, and from the edge of the hood that concealed her face, a small strand of golden, dazzling long hair was exposed. [[4743 旁白 neutral]]
    The scene changed. [[4744 旁白 neutral]]
    Among the mountains, a black figure swiftly moved through the forest. Occasionally, a small merchant caravan would pass by on the path, but no one paid attention to the fleeting black shadow that flashed in the jungle. The figure was as fast as an agile female leopard, but behind her, a uniquely shaped heart-shaped tail swayed. [[4745 旁白 neutral]]
    The scene changed again. [[4746 旁白 neutral]]
    This time, it wasn't focused on a single figure, but an entire grand caravan. The caravan's procession was solemn and luxurious, and the surface of the carriage in the very center bore a snowflake-shaped family crest. [[4747 旁白 neutral]]
    This bizarre dream tormented Andre considerably. After all the scenes had played out, the man abruptly sat up, startled from his bed. He panted heavily, looking around the room vigilantly. When he found everything quiet, a cold breeze brushed against his back. He reached back and felt his palm full of cold sweat that had rubbed off his back. [[4748 旁白 neutral]]
    "Whew... What kind of nightmare was that? There were no scary images, so why did it feel so creepy?" [[4749 安德烈 fearful]]
    He propped his forehead with half a hand, trying his best to calm his breathing. [[4750 旁白 neutral]]
    After the cold wind dried the sweat on his body, he reached out and closed the window, then pulled the curtains shut again. He had thought that being startled awake from a nightmare would leave him wide awake, but after doing all this and lying on the bed, this time, Andre fell into a peaceful sleep, almost instantly. [[4751 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[4752 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[4753 旁白 neutral]]
    Outside the tavern, the patrons smiled and asked Matthew, who was sitting on an empty wine barrel playing a harp at the entrance. [[4754 陌生男1 neutral]]
    "This little tune, why haven't I heard you play it before? It's quite pleasant..." [[4755 陌生男1 neutral]]
    The bard on the empty wine barrel stopped plucking the strings. Perhaps by coincidence, a slight breeze had started when he began playing this melodious tune, but now it suddenly ceased. [[4756 旁白 neutral]]
    Matthew turned his head to look at the smiling patron who asked him and said with a smile. [[4757 旁白 neutral]]
    "The song is inspired by feeling~ After all, inspiration comes from the theme. Perhaps the tune I'm playing is about someone's life they're about to face~" [[4758 马修 neutral]]
    "You're just bragging!" [[4759 陌生男1 happy]]
    The tavern inside and out immediately filled with a lively atmosphere again. [[4760 旁白 happy]]
