"So cold, a cold that pierced to the bone..." [[1965 旁白 fearful]]
"A pale frost covered the living skin, the merciless snow stealing away any remaining warmth. The flow of blood gradually slowed, and it would probably freeze completely before long." [[1966 旁白 fearful]]
"So cold, a cold that pierced to the bone..." [[1967 旁白 fearful]]
"This familiar feeling, after more than ten years, had once again taken over this body." [[1968 旁白 sad]]
"Her thoughts couldn't help but slow down, yet the memories buried deep in her heart grew clearer. In a daze, she seemed to return to that time, curled up alone in a dark, small, and cold room." [[1969 旁白 sad]]
"Even wrapped in two or three thick quilts, the cotton fabric could block the wind and cold from the outside but couldn't drive away the cold from within. The bone-chilling cold made her clutch the blankets tightly, her small, thin body trembling." [[1970 旁白 sad]]
"She herself knew that it made little difference for her body whether she was wrapped up or not. She was born under a cursed star of ice. Even if the fireplace in this room burned its brightest, her fingers stretching out from under the covers could never feel a trace of warmth." [[1971 旁白 sad]]
"The people in her family said she was cursed, a child detested by the gods. Otherwise, why would the great Glacies family, direct descendants of a saintess, cause their mother's death at the moment of birth, and turn the land where she was born into a bitter, cold place that could not be warmed?" [[1972 旁白 sad]]
"This was a divine punishment, a sign that the Ice God was displeased." [[1973 旁白 sad]]
"If not for the fact that the purest blood of the Glacies family truly flowed in her veins, the radicals in the family would have likely lynched her and tied her to the gallows long ago." [[1974 旁白 sad]]
"Being allowed to survive in this small room was already a great mercy in the eyes of the family elders." [[1975 旁白 sad]]
"She was treated like a monster, locked in a room at the very edge of the family estate, with no one allowed to visit. Besides the maid who brought her meals each day, the only living person she could feel was herself." [[1976 旁白 sad]]
"Her cursed body made her suffer from the biting cold day and night since birth. The pain was so deep in her bones that at its worst, she didn't even have the strength to groan." [[1977 旁白 sad]]
"But she endured this pain alone, because she was the cursed one, the one who killed the previous saintess at birth, a sinner who could never feel warmth." [[1978 旁白 sad]]
"The only source of light in the room was half a candle on the small table. Even huddled in the corner, she tried to get as close to the light as possible. The candlelight, a symbol of warmth, reflected in the girl's ice-blue eyes." [[1979 旁白 sad]]
"She reached out her hand, desperate to feel its warmth, but the flame flickered violently from the bone-chilling cold coming from her palm, and then suddenly went out." [[1980 旁白 sad]]
"The room fell into darkness. The biting cold, along with the loneliness, felt like it was about to crush her." [[1981 旁白 fearful]]
"She was the child who had killed her own mother. Therefore, she had to face this pain alone. She held back her tears, not wanting to cry, because she knew her tears would not earn anyone's sympathy. Instead, if the maid who cleaned the room tomorrow found the frozen tears on the floor, her disgusted and disdainful look would once again wound her already broken heart." [[1982 旁白 sad]]
"On the surface, she was the young lady of the Glacies family. In reality, even the lowest-ranking servant girl dared to roll her eyes at her." [[1983 旁白 sad]]
"Heh, blood ties, family affection..." [[1984 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"These things that supposedly connected everyone in the family were, in fact, colder than her own body temperature." [[1985 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Returning to this room, she was no longer that weak and self-conscious little wretch curled up in the corner. Her change in identity allowed her to face the darkest memories of her childhood calmly." [[1986 旁白 neutral]]
"Unfortunately, this wasn't a journey back in time. Everything she saw was just a final, lingering regret before being buried by the ice and snow." [[1987 旁白 sad]]
"White frost had already seeped into the edges of the room and was spreading towards her, consuming the remaining space with unstoppable force." [[1988 旁白 fearful]]
"Once the white frost completely seals the room, everything should be over..." [[1989 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"In the final moments of her life, Serenia simply controlled herself to stand up from the corner she was leaning against, quietly waiting for her end." [[1990 旁白 sad]]
"Once the body of an Ice Calamity is fully unleashed, there is almost no chance of reversing it." [[1991 旁白 neutral]]
"The only way..." [[1992 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"At the thought of the demonic seal she had left with her own hands, which had now completely lost the life force from its host, the girl's ice-blue eyes dimmed completely." [[1993 旁白 sad]]
"As if she had lost all faith, she leaned against the corner and curled up again." [[1994 旁白 sad]]
"I'm sorry, Selen An, I couldn't..." [[1995 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"A rare stinging sensation, a prelude to tears, came to her eyes. This was the first time she had felt the urge to cry since leaving her childhood behind." [[1996 旁白 sad]]
"Don't cry, Serenia. Don't cry. You promised him." [[1997 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"The blurry mist before her eyes seemed to take her back to the day they made their promise to each other." [[1998 旁白 sad]]
"If you want to catch up to me, you'll have to work a lot harder. First, you have to break that habit of crying. I heard from the adults that not crying is a sign of growing up. Only by growing up quickly can you become as strong as me." [[1999 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I... I will break my habit of crying. One day, I will catch up to brother Selen An." [[2000 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"Then let's make a pinky promise." [[2001 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Pinky swear, hang it up, for a hundred years, we can't change!" [[2002 瑟蕾妮娅 happy]]
"The childish voices seemed to echo from yesterday, but what is past belongs to the past. Nothing can go back..." [[2003 旁白 sad]]
"Serenia did not fear death, but she feared loneliness. And now, in the final moments of her life, she could only walk this last path alone." [[2004 旁白 sad]]
"The white frost had already consumed all the remaining space in the room, climbing up and covering the girl's calves. Her body temperature was stolen inch by inch, her vision blurred, and her consciousness grew heavy and hazy." [[2005 旁白 fearful]]
"Realizing she probably only had these last few dozen seconds left, her mental defenses finally gave way to a tide of emotions. Tears streamed down like a bursting dam, freezing into ice crystals mid-air and falling to the ground." [[2006 旁白 sad]]
"Sob... I'm sorry, Selen An, I'm sorry... I-I can't keep our promise anymore... sob..." [[2007 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"The girl's cries were like the loneliest elegy in the night, each large teardrop condensing into a pearl-like crystal as it hit the floor." [[2008 旁白 sad]]
"Goodbye, world..." [[2009 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Since I couldn't keep my promise, it's time for me to join him in the other world." [[2010 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"The merciless frost had already covered half her face. The girl closed her eyes wearily, the last trace of attachment to the world in her voice fading along with the light in her eyes." [[2011 旁白 sad]]
"She had clearly promised him, but in the end, not only had she failed to protect him, she couldn't even keep the pinky promise she made with him." [[2012 旁白 sad]]
"As I thought, this world really doesn't like me..." [[2013 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Just as everything was about to settle, and her beating heart was about to fall into eternal silence with the encroaching ice, her already cold and numb body felt a familiar warmth." [[2014 旁白 surprised]]
"That warmth was like the first stream of spring water from a frozen river, melted by the morning sun." [[2015 旁白 surprised]]
"The spring water rippled with gentle affection, and along with it, a healing and doting voice sounded in her ear." [[2016 旁白 surprised]]
"My little crybaby still hasn't learned to keep her promise~" [[2017 塞伦安 neutral]]
"A whisper, with the unique tone of a siren, sounded next to her ear. The girl's back suddenly sank into a soft, warm embrace that felt like holy water." [[2018 旁白 surprised]]
"Crack!" [[2019 旁白 neutral]]
"With a crisp sound, a crack appeared in the ice that had been soaked in holy water." [[2020 旁白 neutral]]
