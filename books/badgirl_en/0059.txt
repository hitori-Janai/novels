Chapter 59: Werewolf Witch and Bloodline [[3347 旁白 neutral]]
"It's fine for you to think that way, but in the end..." [[3348 旁白 neutral]]
"It's because you haven't been here long and don't know Kempfer Town deeply enough." [[3349 旁白 neutral]]
Andre laid the historical record flat on the table, hands in his pockets. [[3350 旁白 neutral]]
"What do you mean?" [[3351 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Isabella, you've only been here for two years. In these two years, have you noticed anything different about Kempfer Town compared to other cities or villages?" [[3352 安德烈 neutral]]
The sudden question made Isabella ponder, but after a long time, she just shook her head. [[3353 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, maybe I was careless, but to me, Kempfer Town is just a very ordinary village, nothing unusual." [[3354 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
As she spoke, the grey-haired nun's eyes stared directly at Andre, as if searching for an answer on his face. [[3355 旁白 neutral]]
"No, it's not that you were too careless. It's just that some things can only be discovered if you know certain hidden details." [[3356 安德烈 neutral]]
Saying this, the man took out a key from his pocket. The key's surface was smooth, as if polished by long years. [[3357 旁白 neutral]]
"Isabella, do you know which door this key opens?" [[3358 安德烈 neutral]]
"The church door?" [[3359 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella guessed wildly. After all, Andre was always the first to arrive at the church every morning, and he naturally opened the door. But her subconscious told her that this answer was not correct. [[3360 旁白 neutral]]
Sure enough, upon hearing her answer, Andre shook his head. [[3361 旁白 neutral]]
"This is not the key to the church door, but to a cellar." [[3362 安德烈 neutral]]
"A cellar? Do we also bury wine in our church?" [[3363 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella grumbled. Burying wine under a church might be extremely disrespectful in other Saintess territories, but it seemed quite normal in a land protected by the God of Wind. [[3364 旁白 neutral]]
"What's buried in the cellar isn't necessarily wine and food; it could also be something unspeakable." [[3365 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre shook the key in his hand, then clenched it tightly. [[3366 旁白 neutral]]
"This key was left to me by the old man. Before this, it was always with him. The other key, on the other hand, was with the old priest." [[3367 安德烈 neutral]]
"Wait, there are two keys?" [[3368 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"Yes, the cellar door lock requires two keys to open." [[3369 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre lowered his head, and the glasses on his nose reflected a slight gleam. [[3370 旁白 neutral]]
"But what does this have to do with the vampires we were talking about? You're not thinking of..." [[3371 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"It's exactly what you're thinking. According to the incredible, legendary stories recorded in the history, Kempfer Town was once part of the territory ruled by a powerful Bloodline. And that Bloodline's castle happened to be built within the current boundaries of our town..." [[3372 安德烈 neutral]]
"The Bloodline, immortal and ageless, enslaved the people in her territory, treating them as livestock and food, watching them die generation after generation, and calling their children expendable items that could be discarded at will. This kind of rule would eventually face resistance..." [[3373 安德烈 neutral]]
"The evil deeds of that Bloodline Grand Duke finally drew public outrage. All those who dared to resist her gathered together. After careful planning, the resistance group began their operation on the night of the full moon. The process of the operation was not recorded in the history, but the final result was that after paying a huge price, everyone finally dragged the Bloodline Grand Duke into a weakened state. The witch and werewolf in the group, after combining their blood and secret arts, sealed this Bloodline." [[3374 安德烈 neutral]]
"As for what happened next, it was probably that the so-called survivors lived in this territory, and the seal was guarded by generations of werewolf and witch descendants." [[3375 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre's finger tapped the table, pulling Isabella's consciousness back from being immersed in this ancient story. [[3376 旁白 neutral]]
"Uh, sorry, I was just too absorbed in listening." [[3377 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"It's alright. This event itself is very much like a legendary story made up in a picture book. I used to dismiss it as a fictional story, but now it seems... what's recorded in this book might very well be true." [[3378 安德烈 neutral]]
The man's white-gloved hand stroked the old book, his voice filled with emotion. [[3379 旁白 neutral]]
"If a great battle really happened in Kempfer Town in the distant past, and a powerful Bloodline was sealed in this land, then a thousand years later, a group of vampires came back to this land. It's very likely they want to find the seal, unseal it, and release that Bloodline?" [[3380 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella's expression had become completely serious. Although she was usually relaxed and lazy, she was definitely not the kind of person to mess up at a crucial moment. [[3381 旁白 neutral]]
"We can't rule out that possibility. After all, these are just our guesses. We still can't determine whether the evil creatures hidden in the carriage are related to vampires. Even if they are vampires, what if they're just demons who happened to be wandering here? That's also possible, especially since a thousand years have passed..." [[3382 安德烈 neutral]]
"But if it's true, since the Bloodline knew where that powerful Bloodline was sealed, why did they wait until now to rescue them? Unless..." [[3383 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
The more Isabella spoke, the more incredible it seemed, and her voice even carried a few tremors she barely noticed. [[3384 旁白 fearful]]
"Unless the group of Bloodline who want to rescue their leader are also wary of the guardians of the seal, which are the descendants of the witch and werewolf mentioned in this historical record." [[3385 安德烈 neutral]]
"This, this can't be, right? If, as you say, there are descendants of werewolves and witches guarding the seal in the town, then now..." [[3386 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
Isabella's golden-brown pupils suddenly widened at this moment, and a bold idea was born in her mind, expanding uncontrollably. [[3387 旁白 fearful]]
"Is it hard to guess? Or did you guess it, but dare not believe it?" [[3388 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre expressionlessly closed the tattered book and put it back on the bookshelf. Isabella looked at the man's back as he turned, and the pure white priestly robe on him, and her eyes trembled again. [[3389 旁白 fearful]]
"People are always prone to overlook what's right under their noses. When suspecting things, they don't usually think of those closest to them first. But if you think about it carefully, where is the best place to put an important seal that holds evil creatures? And where can the witch and werewolf descendants who guard the seal live normal lives in this land while constantly observing the state of the seal? What place and what identity would fit these conditions?" [[3390 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre turned sideways and reached out to adjust his round glasses on his nose again. The rim of his glasses reflected the lingering glow of the midday sun. [[3391 旁白 neutral]]
The answer was already very clear... [[3392 旁白 neutral]]
"The church and the clergy within the church." [[3393 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella lowered her head, murmuring. [[3394 旁白 neutral]]
After all, in this world, which organization would be more legitimate than the Church to take over the sealing of evil creatures? [[3395 旁白 neutral]]
And building the church directly on top of the seal also seemed logical. [[3396 旁白 neutral]]
The church is a branch organization of the Church set up in various places, and the clergy stationed in the church can constantly monitor the local situation. [[3397 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, there is one more point that best corroborates this conjecture: there are two keys to the cellar. One was passed from the old priest to Andre, and the other was in the hands of the old priestess. [[3398 旁白 neutral]]
Coincidentally, the highest-ranking cleric in Kempfer Town, the old priestess who is currently awaiting summons from the Roland Cathedral, also happens to be an extremely rare female priest, corresponding to the witch descendant among the werewolf and witch. [[3399 旁白 neutral]]
Andre looked at the midday sun outside the window, using its dazzling light to hallucinate the full moon at night. If the old man was a werewolf, then it would explain why all the skills he taught him were close-combat, violent ones. [[3400 旁白 neutral]]
All the incomplete clues and overlooked details seemed to connect at this moment... [[3401 旁白 neutral]]
