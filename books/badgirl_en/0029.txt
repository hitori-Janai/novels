Chapter 29: Reset 29 - The Death of Selen An [[1671 旁白 neutral]]
Four black spears pierced her four limbs, leaving Serenia unable to move. [[1672 旁白 neutral]]
The silver-haired girl gritted her teeth. Even with her pale face, she never let out a single cry of pain or a moan. The black spears in her body sealed her magic flow, completely blocking the only way for it to recover naturally. [[1673 旁白 neutral]]
The great demon, who was built like an iron tower, approached step by step. His hell-red eyes stared at the stubborn girl before him as if admiring an item. [[1674 旁白 fearful]]
On this expedition, not only had he retrieved the pawn, Selen An, as ordered, but he had also unexpectedly captured the Saintess of the Glacies family. He thought about how this pure Saintess, worshiped by thousands in the human kingdom and chosen by the gods, would be claimed by him today and become his wife. [[1675 旁白 neutral]]
If his face wasn't covered by a heavy visor, he, a great demon, would have probably burst into joyful laughter. [[1676 旁白 neutral]]
When his heavy shadow completely covered the girl, Kogsa leaned down slightly, reached out, and lifted her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. [[1677 旁白 fearful]]
"You are quite good, but you have been made weak by human emotions. If not for that useless boy, I would never have been able to catch you. But since you have fallen into my hands, I will make you understand that strong and beautiful females are born to be conquered..." [[1678 克格萨 angry]]
"That boy clearly does not deserve you. The one destined to conquer you is me!" [[1679 克格萨 angry]]
"Whether you accept or refuse, you will eventually find pleasure beneath me. Once you taste that unforgettable joy, even the most holy Saintess will not be able to turn back." [[1680 克格萨 angry]]
Kogsa's words were a shameless spiritual defilement for a Saintess. Serenia glared back at him with eyes that wanted to kill him. Interested, Kogsa increased his aura of pressure, wanting to force her to submit. [[1681 旁白 angry]]
In Kogsa's eyes, this was like breaking a hawk. Only by completely crushing the girl's pride with raw power could he double the enjoyment of the Saintess's soft and sweet submission in humiliation. [[1682 旁白 neutral]]
Throughout history, every Saintess had only two fates on the battlefield: victory or death. Even in desperate situations, they would rather take their own lives than give the demons a chance to capture them. They would never allow the demons an opportunity to defile their purity, which they valued more than life itself. [[1683 旁白 neutral]]
Previous generations of great demons never had the chance, but now the opportunity had fallen into his hands. Kogsa believed he would be the first great demon in the history of the demon world to enjoy such an honor. [[1684 旁白 neutral]]
The powerful pressure made it incredibly difficult for the already weak girl to even breathe, but she did not back down. Just when Kogsa thought this would be a long struggle, the stubborn girl, who had been unyielding just a moment ago, suddenly lowered her head as if giving up, her body trembling slightly. [[1685 旁白 surprised]]
Ha, has she realized the gap between us and finally accepted her fate? [[1686 旁白 happy]]
"Selen An..." [[1687 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
But where he couldn't see, the girl's lowered face was not one of surrender, but a deathly, ashen gray. [[1688 旁白 surprised]]
She whispered the familiar name to herself in disbelief, her once-brilliant ice-blue eyes losing all their color. [[1689 旁白 sad]]
How is this possible? [[1690 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
The mark she had left on Selen An was sending a signal of death. Selen An was dead. Through the mark, she could no longer feel any sign of life or warmth from him. His heartbeat had stopped, declaring his end. [[1691 旁白 sad]]
"Why..." [[1692 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Hm?" [[1693 克格萨 surprised]]
Kogsa caught the lowered girl's whisper, feeling confused. [[1694 旁白 neutral]]
Just as he was about to reach out and force her head up again, Serenia's face lifted without warning. Their eyes met again, and in that brief moment of contact, Kogsa felt a chilling sensation, as if his hands and feet had turned to ice. [[1695 旁白 fearful]]
Her original sapphire-like eyes had lost all their brilliance. They were still beautiful, but it was as if something had stolen all their light in that short time, leaving behind only the gray emptiness of despair. [[1696 旁白 sad]]
"Why did you kill him?" [[1697 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
"?" [[1698 克格萨 surprised]]
"Why would you rather kill him than let him live?! It's always like this... Everyone, you just take away the most precious things in my life, one by one, even the faintest, fleeting flicker of light..." [[1699 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"You wouldn't even spare that?!" [[1700 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
Her desperate questions were tinged with a sob she didn't even notice. Large teardrops rolled down her cheeks. A beauty was in tears, yet no one felt any tenderness, because the moment the hot tears fell, they froze into ice! [[1701 旁白 sad]]
The blizzard that had stopped, like embers fanned back to life in a pile of ash, was reignited once more... [[1702 旁白 neutral]]
But this time was different from the last. There was no divine radiance, no brilliant holy light. The cold wind no longer scraped against the face like a steel knife but was a chill that came from the bottom of the heart. [[1703 旁白 fearful]]
"You!" [[1704 克格萨 fearful]]
Kogsa suddenly felt something was wrong. He was about to retreat but found his legs covered in a thick layer of white frost. From discovery to reaction, it took only a few seconds, and his legs, which were merely trapped by ice and snow, had quickly gone numb. [[1705 旁白 fearful]]
A touch of fear crept into Kogsa's heart. He was a great demon of the demon world, a noble existence second only to the Demon King. His powerful bloodline made him invincible on the battlefield, yet this power was crumbling before a chill as pale as death itself, which stole all life... [[1706 旁白 fearful]]
This was not the power a normal person should have, not even a Saintess who inherited the blood of a god. [[1707 旁白 fearful]]
Realizing something was wrong, Kogsa didn't hesitate. It was too late to stop the deathly blizzard the girl had unleashed. Dark demonic power gathered in his hand, and a giant bone axe glowing with a faint light suddenly appeared. Kogsa twisted his waist and mercilessly swung the giant axe at his own legs. [[1708 旁白 surprised]]
Ordinary demons had extremely strong life force, let alone a noble great demon. Even if he lost his legs, as long as he could return to the demon world alive, there were ways to recover. But if he were to perish in this deathly blizzard... [[1709 旁白 neutral]]
Whether human or demon, everyone only has one life! [[1710 旁白 neutral]]
His body, with its legs severed, lost balance and fell to the ground. Kogsa wretchedly clawed at the ground with his hands, about to use his magic to distance himself from this madwoman, but it was too late... [[1711 旁白 fearful]]
At the center of this pale blizzard, all things would fall silent in the embrace of extreme cold. [[1712 旁白 neutral]]
[Forbidden Curse: Ice Calamity Body Fully Unleashed] [[1713 旁白 surprised]]
The white frost spread inch by inch, covering the girl's face. She stared blankly at this world about to be enveloped in whiteness, shedding one last warm tear as she cried out. [[1714 旁白 sad]]
"Selen An, you big liar!" [[1715 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
The girl's final shout seemed to contain some kind of power. The sound pierced through the barrier of the snowstorm, ignoring the decay of distance, and carried its emotion thousands of meters away, to the ears of the cold body half-buried in the snow. [[1716 旁白 sad]]
... [[1717 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1718 旁白 neutral]]
So dark, so cold. My body feels like it has fallen into a silent ice cave. [[1719 旁白 fearful]]
Is this what death feels like? [[1720 旁白 sad]]
I've lost all conscious control, as if I'm sinking into a chaotic river, drifting endlessly with the current, as if the long passage of time will wear away this last bit of spirit. [[1721 旁白 sad]]
Everything is over. I killed Mara, saved Anna, and changed the predetermined fate. With no lingering attachments, I should accept death, close my eyes forever in this chaotic darkness. But for some reason, even in this sunless dark, I feel as if a rope is pulling me, refusing death, as if there is still something important left to do... [[1722 旁白 sad]]
Until a voice, from a distant, unknown place, faintly pierced through the barrier of life and death. [[1723 旁白 neutral]]
"Selen An..." [[1724 旁白 neutral]]
Someone is calling me. Who could it be? [[1725 塞伦安 surprised]]
This voice... is so familiar... [[1726 塞伦安 neutral]]
"You big liar!" [[1727 旁白 angry]]
Another voice came, this time clearer than the one that called his name. The tone of the voice was like a heavy hammer, striking the soul that was about to fall into a deep slumber. [[1728 旁白 surprised]]
With the voice, the thread pulling at him suddenly tightened. Like a fish caught on a hook, he was forcefully dragged out of the dark, chaotic river by the suddenly taut line. [[1729 旁白 surprised]]
His vision turned from black to white, no longer chaotic. As his sight gradually returned, a blurry figure appeared before him... [[1730 旁白 neutral]]
