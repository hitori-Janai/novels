Chapter 26 Reset 26: Only Another Succubus Can Kill a Succubus [[1504 旁白 neutral]]
Is it... really going to end like this? [[1505 塞伦安 sad]]
His consciousness, about to be lost in the storm of desire, had almost no strength left to resist. In the moment before defeat, this was the only thought left in his mind... [[1506 旁白 fearful]]
He knew he couldn't win. [[1507 旁白 sad]]
When he tried to be a hero, giving up the chance to escape and staying to face Mara alone, he should have known this would be the end. [[1508 旁白 neutral]]
How could a normal person possibly defeat a succubus? [[1509 旁白 sad]]
Even before he was transported into this game, the game's text descriptions and CGs had clearly shown the huge gap between mortals and demons. [[1510 旁白 neutral]]
Staying behind meant certain death, he understood that well. But as his body was about to be reshaped into flesh driven by desire, the last bit of his spirit was incredibly calm... [[1511 旁白 neutral]]
Does he regret it? Facing death directly, he didn't seem to have any regrets. [[1512 旁白 neutral]]
Why did he go this far? [[1513 旁白 neutral]]
When he first arrived, his mind was filled with thoughts of how to survive. But his body seemed to move on its own, not controlled by his mind, leading him step by step to this point. When and why did he start to stray from his original path? [[1514 旁白 neutral]]
Was it the moment Serenia pushed him away? Was it the sight of Anna when he woke up? Was it that mother's gentle and kind treatment of him, or was it... [[1515 旁白 neutral]]
The distant memories that burst forth like a slideshow deep in his mind while he was unconscious. [[1516 旁白 neutral]]
Those distant, forgotten memories felt like a lost treasure returning to his hands, without any sense of strangeness or distance. [[1517 旁白 neutral]]
Actually, he had guessed the answer long ago but was just unwilling to accept it. So was this a punishment from the gods, or was it a chance for redemption woven by fate? [[1518 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't give up... Embrace it, accept it... I have always been here, waiting for you..." [[1519 陌生女1 neutral]]
A mysterious, otherworldly female voice suddenly sounded again. Its appearance was like a clear spring, putting out the evil fire of desire that was about to consume his final moment. A gentle, cool touch brushed past his weak soul. In the hot purple flames, pure water tied itself around his wrist like a thin string. [[1520 旁白 surprised]]
The water was pulling him up. [[1521 旁白 hopeful]]
In reality, because of the push from the succubus blood, the physical changes that had been slow to happen all erupted at once. Small, black bat-like wings sprouted from his fair, smooth back, curved ram's horns grew from the sides of his flawless forehead, and at the base of his spine, a new, heart-tipped tail unfolded from behind him. [[1522 旁白 surprised]]
At this moment, Mara could no longer hold back the excitement in her eyes. She let go of the throat she was gripping, allowing him to collapse onto the snow, legs spread apart, his body trembling slightly. [[1523 玛拉 happy]]
The ritual was over. From the looks of it, Selen An had undoubtedly and completely fallen and become a succubus. But one thing surprised her—judging by the new succubus features, Selen An had actually transformed into a rather rare high-tier succubus. [[1524 玛拉 surprised]]
Normal demons could judge a bloodline's rank just by the wings. A succubus with black bat wings was nothing like a low or mid-tier succubus with ugly, fleshy wings. [[1525 旁白 neutral]]
Could this be the power of someone with a saintess's bloodline? [[1526 玛拉 surprised]]
No matter how weak the person was, once their bloodline was tainted and corrupted, it could still show talent beyond the reach of ordinary people if it was nourished by some kind of power. [[1527 旁白 neutral]]
At this thought, the flames of jealousy burned fiercely in Mara's heart. Why was it that when they were both human, Selen An was a high and mighty noble, while she was a nameless nun whose cries for justice no one would hear? Now that they were both succubi, even though she had transformed years before, Selen An had still become a high-tier demon that she had to look up to. [[1528 玛拉 angry]]
The jealousy in a human's heart might be held back by reason and morals. But demons are a race without moral limits. Once jealousy filled her heart, revenge followed... [[1529 旁白 neutral]]
A demonic light flashed in Mara's hand, and a metal collar with mysterious magic symbols appeared in her palm. She looked at Selen An, who was still sitting on the snow as if dazed from the rebirth, and a cruel smile appeared on her lips. [[1530 玛拉 angry]]
So what if she's a high-tier succubus? [[1531 玛拉 angry]]
A newborn succubus is as fragile as a baby. As long as this slave collar is on her neck, even a high-tier succubus will be mine to command. [[1532 玛拉 angry]]
A prisoner should kneel at my feet like a dog, begging for the victor's mercy and charity. I didn't drag Selen An into the abyss of corruption just to find myself a new master! [[1533 玛拉 angry]]
Once this slave collar is on her, no matter what incredible power she has, she won't be able to cause any trouble. If my plan succeeds, my own status among the demons will rise, since I will control a high-tier succubus. [[1534 玛拉 happy]]
Thinking this, Mara opened the collar in her hand, knelt down, and without any caution, prepared to put it on her... [[1535 玛拉 neutral]]
A newborn succubus's body and mind are greatly shocked and twisted, so for a while after their transformation, they are in a state of extreme confusion. This was why Mara dared to be so careless while putting on the collar; after all, she had gone through the same thing. [[1536 旁白 neutral]]
But, just as the open collar was behind her neck and about to click shut, the smile on Mara's face froze. In the fading blizzard, the muffled sound of something sharp piercing flesh was exceptionally clear. [[1537 旁白 surprised]]
She looked down and saw a hand completely buried in her own stomach, like a sharp spear piercing through her. [[1538 玛拉 fearful]]
"You..." [[1539 玛拉 surprised]]
The collar in her hand fell silently into the snow. [[1540 旁白 neutral]]
Purple succubus blood splattered onto the white snow like paint. She looked up in disbelief and met that face, so alluring and demonic it seemed unreal. [[1541 玛拉 fearful]]
"It seems a succubus's claws can easily break through its own skin." [[1542 塞伦安 neutral]]
The white-haired girl said calmly, her pink, heart-shaped pupils showing a deep, perhaps intentional, mockery. [[1543 旁白 neutral]]
After speaking, she pulled her hand out from the other's stomach, bringing a large amount of blood and torn flesh with it. [[1544 塞伦安 angry]]
Such a bad wound would be enough to make a person pass out from the pain. As the hand was pulled out, stirring the wound, Mara, despite the massive blood loss, still managed to endure the pain, beat her wings, and quickly retreat to create distance. [[1545 旁白 surprised]]
"It wasn't a fatal blow, huh~" [[1546 塞伦安 angry]]
The white-haired succubus, who had been sitting on her knees in the snow, stood up. She tilted her head slightly, looking at the other's blood on her hand, her charming voice carrying a hint of madness. [[1547 塞伦安 angry]]
She sniffed her kin's blood in the air and couldn't help but stick out her tongue to lick her lips. Her body felt like a huge furnace, and inside that furnace, a fire called desire was burning fiercely. [[1548 旁白 neutral]]
Driven by desire and instinct, she now had two very strong urges. [[1549 旁白 neutral]]
The blood-stained hand instinctively wanted to reach for that untouched, pure place that no one had ever violated. But this body was ultimately still controlled by reason. She bit her tongue hard, and the sharp pain stopped her from this absurd act. [[1550 塞伦安 angry]]
No, I can't do that. If I really did something like that on the battlefield, what would be the difference between me and Mara? [[1551 塞伦安 angry]]
Since one of the strongest desires could not be released, it had to be directed to the other one—the nature of every demon, the nature called slaughter! [[1552 旁白 angry]]
Mara felt the newborn succubus's gaze on her, and it carried an unconcealed killing intent. Rage instantly exploded in her chest. [[1553 玛拉 angry]]
Her recent prey, who had just had a moment of luck, now dares to bare its teeth at her in a show of force. Unforgivable! [[1554 玛拉 angry]]
The huge wound in her abdomen healed by more than half in just a few breaths. The bleeding stopped, and the tender new flesh at the wound was visibly squirming and closing. [[1555 旁白 neutral]]
This was the powerful life force of demons, a powerful body that humans could never hope to match. [[1556 旁白 neutral]]
"You... you still have your consciousness from when you were human?" [[1557 玛拉 surprised]]
Mara clutched her nearly healed wound, her eyes filled not only with anger but also with shock. [[1558 玛拉 surprised]]
Why? The plan had gone exactly as she had expected. But not only had the other person turned into a higher-tier succubus than her, she had also retained her clear, human consciousness after the corruption. [[1559 玛拉 fearful]]
This was almost unheard of! [[1560 玛拉 fearful]]
The power of corruption should have destroyed her human understanding and stripped away her original values and morals. But those eyes and that tone, besides the madness and killing intent of a demon, mostly showed a human's desire for revenge. [[1561 旁白 neutral]]
"Are you surprised? You should be. After all, if the life-and-death gamble I made couldn't make you panic, that would be against the rules of fate, wouldn't it?~" [[1562 塞伦安 angry]]
A wild, crazed smile spread across "Selen An's" dangerously beautiful face. This mix of beauty and madness made Mara feel a new kind of fear. [[1563 旁白 fearful]]
To be honest, from a magical power perspective, the current Selen An was still weaker than her. But facing this newborn demon, she felt a familiar sense of pressure, like when she faced General Kogsar. [[1564 玛拉 fearful]]
"Only another succubus can kill a succubus. That's why I let you do what you wanted, Mara..." [[1565 塞伦安 angry]]
"If you didn't turn me into a succubus, how could I use this power to kill you?" [[1566 塞伦安 angry]]
