Chapter 11: Reset 11 Andre [[639 旁白 neutral]]
"I-is that so... Anna, that's a very nice name..." [[640 塞伦安 neutral]]
As Selen An stammered out the hasty compliment, the air fell silent. Anna, who was applying his medicine, looked at the young man's evasive eyes and shook her head. [[641 旁白 neutral]]
"Nice? Not really. It's just a very common name. In the entire empire, I'm far from the only girl named Anna." [[642 安娜 neutral]]
The girl's flat statement seemed completely different from her earlier attitude when she was bandaging his wounds. Selen An's awkward expression froze, unsure how to respond. [[643 旁白 neutral]]
The continent he had transmigrated to was a typical Western fantasy world. In Western society, the name Anna was indeed as common as 'Liu Wei' in a certain large Eastern country. [[644 旁白 neutral]]
"But... thank you anyway." [[645 安娜 neutral]]
"Huh?!" [[646 塞伦安 surprised]]
Anna stood up, picked up the earthenware pot, and looked once more at the disheveled young man on the straw mat. [[647 旁白 neutral]]
"This is the first time in my life anyone has ever told me my name is nice." [[648 安娜 sad]]
After speaking, the girl left. She went to the simple earthen stove again, placed another pot on it, poured in water, and put in peas to cook. [[649 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An watched Anna's back, opening his mouth several times, but he didn't know what to say. [[650 旁白 neutral]]
After the first attempt, there was no need for more compliments. As for conversation, what was there to talk about with this girl? [[651 旁白 neutral]]
In Anna's eyes, Selen An was the enemy who had ruined her family, an unforgivable existence. He was lucky to be rescued this time without being recognized, perhaps because he looked so different now. [[652 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, he looked down at his tattered clothes, torn from his escape. The original Selen An he remembered always wore magnificent formal attire, his sea-blue hair impeccably styled by maids. [[653 旁白 neutral]]
And now? [[654 旁白 neutral]]
His clothes were rags, his face was filthy. Such a sloppy appearance was a world away from the glamorous young master. A normal person wouldn't connect the two without a closer look. [[655 旁白 neutral]]
But had Anna really not recognized him? [[656 旁白 neutral]]
He still had his doubts because of the look in her eyes—that cool, self-mocking gaze, and an emotion he couldn't decipher. [[657 旁白 neutral]]
If she had recognized him, why would she save the villain who destroyed her family? [[658 旁白 fearful]]
Selen An didn't understand. [[659 旁白 neutral]]
Reason told him that since Anna saved him, she definitely hadn't recognized him. But his gut told him that her gaze, her words, held feelings and meanings he couldn't grasp. [[660 旁白 fearful]]
After thinking it over and finding no answer, he gave up. [[661 旁白 neutral]]
These weren't his most pressing concerns. Whether Anna recognized him or not, he was safe for now. But what about later? [[662 旁白 fearful]]
Was he really safe? How was Serenia doing? Would the Demon Clan's cavalry track him down again using the Succubus Seed inside him? [[663 旁白 fearful]]
A tangle of questions gave Selen An a splitting headache. [[664 旁白 fearful]]
He had transmigrated into a disastrous situation. His only paths seemed to be death or corruption. Without any special abilities, he couldn't seem to change the plot's direction. [[665 旁白 sad]]
Even if he luckily survived the first wave, there would be a second, and a third... [[666 旁白 fearful]]
The peas bubbled in the pot, and the woman on the bed still breathed weakly. Selen An was lost in thought when he heard a grating creak. [[667 旁白 neutral]]
The old wooden door opened. The slender girl was already halfway out. The sky outside was nearing dusk. Seeing the sky through the crack in the door, the young man's throat tightened, and he quickly called out. [[668 旁白 neutral]]
"Where are you going?" [[669 塞伦安 fearful]]
Anna stopped and looked back at Selen An. [[670 旁白 neutral]]
"To find food." [[671 安娜 neutral]]
Looking at the girl's sallow face, a result of food scarcity, the guilt he had just suppressed surged up again. He opened his mouth several times, but only a few dry words came out. [[672 塞伦安 sad]]
"But it's dangerous outside..." [[673 塞伦安 fearful]]
"Sir, for ordinary people in this world, danger is everywhere. In this wasteland, there might be wolves and tigers that threaten my life, but even in the so-called civilized city-states, there are still people who would covet my body." [[674 安娜 sad]]
Anna's tone was extremely calm, a calmness that a child her age shouldn't possess. Her blue eyes were almost without a ripple. [[675 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An was stunned at first, then his face burned with unstoppable heat and shame. The girl's words were like a sharp slap across his face. [[676 塞伦安 sad]]
He lowered his head, desperately trying to hide the guilt in his eyes. [[677 旁白 neutral]]
I can't be too obvious. I can't let Anna discover the truth. Surviving is the ultimate goal. Even if I want to compensate this mother and daughter, it has to wait until I'm free. [[678 旁白 neutral]]
He warned himself. [[679 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry..." [[680 塞伦安 sad]]
"Sir, there's no need to apologize. I understand your good intentions, but without food, we will all die." [[681 安娜 sad]]
With another weary creak, the wooden door closed, and the sound of the girl's footsteps faded into the distance. [[682 旁白 sad]]
The room fell silent again. The young man lifted his hand, enduring the pain, and stared at his palm. The girl's voice seemed to echo in his ears. [[683 旁白 sad]]
This dilapidated wooden hut was undoubtedly still within the Craigmore wasteland. It seemed safe for now, but once outside, he could easily run into the Demon Clan's cavalry searching for him. [[684 旁白 fearful]]
In the story, causing the descendant of the Water Saintess to degenerate into a succubus was a key move in the Demon Clan's game. To ensure the plan's success, they had sent thousands of troops to support Mara, even at the risk of starting a war. [[685 旁白 fearful]]
The demons wouldn't let him go easily. They were surely still searching everywhere. [[686 旁白 fearful]]
As for Serenia, without him as a burden, she should be able to survive against several thousand demon troops. [[687 旁白 neutral]]
But now, he was like a hunted dog, exhausted and battered despite racking his brain. His future was completely unknown. [[688 旁白 fearful]]
Guilt towards the girl, confusion about the future... he looked at his carefully bandaged arm, his mind a complete mess. [[689 旁白 sad]]
The dim room had no luxurious crystal chandelier, not even a basic kerosene lamp for light. It was lit only by the faint twilight peeking through the wooden window and door cracks. [[690 旁白 neutral]]
"Cough, cough..." [[691 妇人 sad]]
The woman's cough echoed beside him, making the wooden bed creak. [[692 旁白 neutral]]
The sound pulled Selen An's consciousness back to reality. He turned to look at the woman on the bed. Though her face was thin and her hair was dull, her beautiful eyes were still bright. [[693 旁白 neutral]]
"Sir, could you come over for a moment?" [[694 妇人 neutral]]
Her voice was weak and intermittent, but it couldn't hide the gentleness within it. [[695 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An followed her gaze, struggled up from the straw mat, and sat on the wooden chair near the bed. [[696 旁白 neutral]]
"Ma'am, are you not feeling well?" [[697 塞伦安 neutral]]
He looked at the mother's swollen belly, his heart in turmoil. [[698 旁白 neutral]]
"Now that it's just the two of us in the room, would you be willing to talk with a simple village woman like me?" [[699 妇人 neutral]]
"Of course, I..." [[700 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Hehe, you seem a bit shy, sir. When Anna brought you back, I was quite startled. I thought she had gotten into some trouble on the road..." [[701 妇人 neutral]]
"Thank you, ma'am, and Miss Anna, for saving my life. I will surely repay your kindness with all my strength in the future." [[702 塞伦安 neutral]]
Facing this pregnant woman, a mother of two, and being watched by her bright, beautiful eyes, Selen An felt as if he were a child again, being stared at by his mother after making a mistake. [[703 旁白 neutral]]
"You must be a nobleman, sir?" [[704 妇人 neutral]]
"I..." [[705 塞伦安 fearful]]
"You have an extraordinary air about you, sir. You must be a noble. May I ask your family name?" [[706 妇人 neutral]]
"..." [[707 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An wanted to refuse, but looking into the mother's eyes and thinking about who was responsible for the plight of this mother and daughter, he felt he couldn't deny her request. [[708 旁白 sad]]
After a long pause, he spoke. [[709 旁白 neutral]]
"Andre. My name is Andre." [[710 塞伦安 neutral]]
In the dim room, the young man spoke. [[711 旁白 neutral]]
