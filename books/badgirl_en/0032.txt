Chapter 32: Reset 32 - Back from the Dead [[1854 旁白 neutral]]
"Drip... drip..." [[1855 旁白 neutral]]
It sounded like raindrops falling into a palm, splashing softly. [[1856 旁白 neutral]]
"Drip... drip..." [[1857 旁白 neutral]]
The burning wetness carried the warmth of a young woman. As Selen An slowly woke up, he realized it wasn't rain from the sky, but a girl's tears. [[1858 旁白 neutral]]
His chest was being pressed with a steady rhythm, and his lips were covered from time to time. The girl's sweet scent and softness lingered on his lips. She was blowing large breaths of air into his body. Her hands didn't stop, and neither did her prayers. [[1859 旁白 neutral]]
"Wake up, wake up! Mr. Selen An, wake up!" [[1860 安娜 fearful]]
"Please, don't die, don't die..." [[1861 安娜 sad]]
The girl's crying voice and hot tears were like a magic spell meant to awaken a sleeping beauty, pouring into the white-haired succubus who lay lifeless in the snow. [[1862 旁白 neutral]]
Heat, sound, touch—he could feel all these things from the outside world clearly. But even as his mind became clearer, the body holding his soul felt as if it had been dead for half a day, too stiff to control at all. [[1863 旁白 fearful]]
What's going on? Why can't I control this body? [[1864 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An was confused, but he also noticed something strange. It was so hot, coming from his palms. Before he died, his hands were still gripping the holy sword that had burned onto them. [[1865 旁白 surprised]]
The strange heat came from the holy sword. As time passed, the ceremonial sword, half-buried in the snow, grew hotter. In the real world, Anna, who was still performing CPR, also noticed something was wrong. [[1866 旁白 neutral]]
But it wasn't because of the heat, but because of light. [[1867 旁白 neutral]]
The long sword held tightly in Selen An's hands suddenly began to glow. As the light grew stronger, she could clearly feel the body she had been giving CPR to for so long was slowly warming up. [[1868 旁白 surprised]]
She stared in shock at the incredible scene before her, forgetting to breathe for a moment. [[1869 旁白 surprised]]
Until... [[1870 旁白 neutral]]
Until the Demon Clan's iron cavalry broke the silence of the snowy battlefield. Anna looked cautiously toward the sound and saw dozens of dark figures riding quickly in their direction from a distance. [[1871 旁白 fearful]]
It was the Demon Clan's pursuers. They must have followed some kind of signal, riding hard to catch up to this place. [[1872 旁白 fearful]]
The warning of danger made Anna want to run away instinctively. But the glowing sword in the snow and the white-haired succubus beneath her, who was miraculously warming up, made her hesitate for a moment. [[1873 旁白 fearful]]
Fortunately, she was a decisive girl. After only a moment's hesitation, she gritted her teeth, pushed down the fearful urge to flee, and placed her hands on Selen An's chest, pressing down to make every second count. [[1874 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't want to give up this chance. There was finally a sign of hope. Maybe the gods had heard her prayers, or maybe members of the Winterlein family just had miraculous powers. But none of that mattered to her. She just wanted the person lying in the snow to stand up again. [[1875 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't care about hatred or suffering. The moment he had stood in front of her to protect her, she might have already let go of her hate. [[1876 旁白 neutral]]
The Demon Clan's cavalry was now 500 meters away. [[1877 旁白 fearful]]
Anna felt the body under her hands had become soft again. [[1878 旁白 surprised]]
The Demon Clan's cavalry was now 300 meters away. [[1879 旁白 fearful]]
Color was returning to his pale lips and cheeks. [[1880 旁白 surprised]]
Only a hundred meters left. She could almost smell the strong stench of blood and filth from the demons. [[1881 旁白 fearful]]
Beads of sweat rolled down the girl's forehead and cheeks, dripping onto Selen An's torn clothes. She bit her lip so hard from the tension that it started to bleed, and small drops of red blood fell onto the snow like tiny plum blossoms. [[1882 旁白 fearful]]
Wake up, wake up... [[1883 安娜 fearful]]
Fifty meters... [[1884 旁白 fearful]]
The roars of the demons were right beside them. The demon soldiers on their mounts had already raised their spears, ready to throw. [[1885 旁白 fearful]]
Anna used all her strength, continuing the CPR without stopping. Just as she was about to collapse from exhaustion and despair, she felt a tiny vibration through the touch of their skin. [[1886 旁白 surprised]]
It's a heartbeat. His heartbeat has returned. [[1887 旁白 surprised]]
The girl's body froze. Her eyes widened as she stared at the succubus in the snow, as if she had forgotten the danger and death that were so close. [[1888 旁白 surprised]]
"Whoosh!" [[1889 旁白 neutral]]
A spear tore through the air, flying straight toward Anna's back. Death came so quickly that by the time the girl realized she was about to be attacked, she had no time to dodge or turn around. [[1890 旁白 fearful]]
Pale despair washed over her face. She was too exhausted to escape. As death approached, she closed her eyes, and time seemed to slow down infinitely in that instant. [[1891 旁白 fearful]]
"Drip... drip..." [[1892 旁白 neutral]]
It sounded like raindrops falling into a palm, splashing softly. [[1893 旁白 neutral]]
"Drip... drip..." [[1894 旁白 neutral]]
It felt like a mother's gentle hand wiping away her tears, holding her tightly in an embrace. The wind was no longer cold. Even though she was about to die, she felt as if she had returned to a warm house. A light, elegant scent filled her nose, and the warm hug was so comfortable that she wanted to stay in it forever. [[1895 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of water, like a mountain spring, flowed by her ears. The feeling of peace was like a dream. Is this the "life review" that old people talk about? [[1896 旁白 neutral]]
Death didn't seem as painful as she had imagined. [[1897 旁白 neutral]]
"Am I dead?" [[1898 安娜 surprised]]
"I don't think so." [[1899 水之圣女 neutral]]
The sudden, unfamiliar female voice made Anna open her eyes. The first thing she saw was a face so magnificent it made her forget to breathe for a moment. [[1900 旁白 surprised]]
At this moment, Selen An had completely lost the seductive look of a succubus. His facial features were like a work of art carved by the gods themselves. [[1901 旁白 neutral]]
The young woman wore a golden crown, and her sea-blue hair flowed like a sunlit tide, reaching her waist. The end of each strand shimmered with a rainbow-like halo. [[1902 旁白 neutral]]
At first glance, her blue eyes seemed as gentle as water, but a closer look revealed a deep and quiet mystery, like an endless ocean hiding countless secrets. The center of her blue pupils was marked with a unique water-drop pattern. [[1903 旁白 neutral]]
Her holy, water-drop blue eyes looked past Anna. The spear that should have pierced her back was now frozen in mid-air, held by an invisible force. If you looked closely, you could see the spear's tip was stuck on a thin film of water. [[1904 旁白 neutral]]
The water film looked like it would break with a single touch, but the sharp spearhead could not move forward another inch. All of its force was being completely spread out by the water elements in the film. [[1905 旁白 neutral]]
The rain, which had stopped because of the blizzard, began to fall again. But the raindrops silently avoided her, and she stood up from the rain, her holy dress, which she had changed into at some point, now fully revealed. [[1906 旁白 neutral]]
The swallow-tailed holy dress had a front hem that fell just three inches above her knees, fully showing the long, rounded legs wrapped in side-laced white stockings and the pure white high heels on her feet. The back of the dress spread out on the snow like a mermaid's tail fin, the moon-blue satin fabric embroidered with divine patterns. [[1907 旁白 neutral]]
The holy and magnificent dress outlined the young woman's perfect female curves. Her shoulders were bare, and her hands were covered in white lace gloves that extended to her arms. The gloves did not cover her entire hand, but instead had a loop of fabric that went around her middle finger. [[1908 旁白 neutral]]
Her blue eyelashes were like a pair of small fans. Her water-drop blue eyes were breathtakingly beautiful. Pure streams of water, as if summoned, circled around her like ceremonial ribbons. She stood up and walked in front of Anna, shielding her with her body. [[1909 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know that this single action had made Anna, who was looking up at her profile, completely mesmerized. Anna was now speechless. It was a kind of shock from beauty. Being at a loss for words was the best way to describe her appearance. If one had to describe it, the saintess's beauty was beyond the limits of mortal appreciation. It was a holy beauty that transcended gender. [[1910 旁白 neutral]]
It was a beauty so extreme, so pure and divine, that it infected all who looked upon her, inspiring reverence and a desire to worship. [[1911 旁白 neutral]]
