Chapter 92: The Method of Removal [[5203 旁白 neutral]]
"So you're saying a Tier 6 is sealed beneath this pool?" [[5204 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella couldn't help but gasp. As a Tier 4 Archmage, she naturally understood the vast difference between each tier. [[5205 旁白 neutral]]
To put it bluntly, on the battlefield that day, she fought alongside Andre. Thousands of ghouls and vampires fell before her cross-shaped spear like fields of wheat being reaped. [[5206 旁白 neutral]]
Among the slain vampires were Tier 3 minor nobles. But even with just a one-tier difference, she could still effortlessly crush them like they were nothing. This was merely the gap between Tier 4 and Tier 3. [[5207 旁白 neutral]]
Once you reached Tier 6, the gap was so immense it was no exaggeration to call it a heavenly chasm! [[5208 旁白 fearful]]
"A Tier 6 from thousands of years ago, with its body and soul now sealed. With the four of us, if we are careful, there's nothing to fear." [[5209 墨莺 neutral]]
"But I still find it hard to imagine how two Tier 5s could seal a Tier 6. I mean, when I fight Tier 3 enemies..." [[5210 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"There are differences between Tier 5s, and the same goes for Tier 6. From this pool, I can sense three auras: a vampire, a werewolf, and a witch." [[5211 安德烈 neutral]]
"Judging by the strength of these residual auras, the Witch and the Werewolf King of that time joined forces. Both should have been peak Tier 5 powerhouses. In addition, werewolves and witches have a certain natural advantage over vampires. After paying a heavy price, it wouldn't be impossible to barely seal a Tier 6." [[5212 安德烈 neutral]]
Because of the water in the pool, Andre's perception was further enhanced. As he said this, he noticed everyone's eyes were focused on him. [[5213 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahem... why are you all looking at me like that?" [[5214 安德烈 surprised]]
"Andre, I remember you aren't a perception-type priest. How did your senses become so sharp as soon as we got underground today?" [[5215 伊莎ベラ surprised]]
Isabella held her cross-shaped spear and raised an eyebrow at Andre. [[5216 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm... maybe it's just a coincidence, but the environment here does give me a strange sense of affinity." [[5217 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre adjusted the round-framed glasses on his nose, his expression calm. [[5218 旁白 neutral]]
"It must be the water elements, right? Last time, I sensed a high affinity for water elements from Mr. Andre. This cellar is dark and damp year-round, and with such a large pool, a water-element mage can perceive the details of this space clearly even without their eyes." [[5219 墨莺 neutral]]
Perhaps feeling the atmosphere was too heavy, or perhaps wanting to lighten the mood of the mission, Mo Ying spoke in a voice as pleasant as a lark's song. [[5220 旁白 happy]]
"Miss Mo Ying's eyes are truly sharp." [[5221 安德烈 neutral]]
"Hah, alright. Everyone has their own secrets. I'm not the type to pry into others' secrets, so Mr. Andre, just treat this as a casual chat between friends." [[5222 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Andre breathed a sigh of relief and nodded silently. [[5223 旁白 neutral]]
It had to be said, although Mo Ying was a bit slow in some respects, she was worthy of being the Saintess of the God of Wisdom. To be so clever at such a young age, understanding how to maintain a comfortable distance between people—no one in the world could truly dislike a girl like her. [[5224 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, enough small talk. Although we're facing a sealed vampire duke, he was still a Tier 6. We must be careful. Let's get to work." [[5225 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Wait, milady. The seal seems to be fused with this entire area. If we want to take the seal and the being within it, the only way seems to be..." [[5226 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella suddenly spoke out, as if she had thought of something. [[5227 旁白 neutral]]
"To open a part of the seal." [[5228 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Behind them, the quiet Seraphina spoke, and Mo Ying nodded. [[5229 旁白 neutral]]
"Everyone, there's no need to worry. Seraphina and I will handle this part. While opening the seal, I will use the [Ring of Disciplinary Wind] to suppress the flow of magic as much as possible. That way, even if we open a part of the seal and awaken the being inside, the [Ring of Disciplinary Wind] can compensate for the weakened part." [[5230 墨莺 neutral]]
"Seraphina will set up a spatial transportation matrix behind us in advance. We just need to place the seal's vessel within the matrix's range, and it will be transported to the corresponding coordinates—the Cathedral of the Wind God, where Her Highness the Saintess has already arranged for the other ten Holy Sisters to be waiting." [[5231 墨莺 neutral]]
"As for undoing a part of the seal, I'll have to trouble Mr. Andre and Isabella with that." [[5232 墨莺 neutral]]
Mo Ying laid out her plan. [[5233 旁白 neutral]]
"That's not a problem. But do you know the method for removing the seal?" [[5234 安德烈 neutral]]
"Yes, it's written on those chains. Don't be surprised. The method to undo a seal is also part of the seal itself. The stronger the seal, the more complete it is. So, the difficulty often isn't the method, but meeting the conditions required by the method." [[5235 墨莺 neutral]]
"And the method to undo these two seals is to have descendants with the blood of a werewolf and a witch drip their blood into the pool. That will undo the first layer of the seal." [[5236 墨莺 neutral]]
The green-haired girl with twin tails explained. [[5237 旁白 neutral]]
"So simple? That doesn't sound like... wait!" [[5238 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella's eyes widened, her expression suddenly stiffening. [[5239 旁白 surprised]]
"Where are we supposed to find descendants of a witch and a werewolf now?" [[5240 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
According to Andre's deduction, the old priest who was a werewolf descendant was already dead, and he had no blood relatives besides his adopted son, Andre. The old priestess who was a witch descendant was still in Roland City. It would be too late to summon her back for tonight's business. [[5241 旁白 sad]]
"I'll take care of the witch's blood." [[5242 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Seraphina, her face half-covered by a black veil, stepped out from the shadows behind and walked to the edge of the pool. [[5243 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, right! How could I forget? Seraphina, you're a descendant of a witch too!" [[5244 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
Isabella slapped her forehead as if recalling some important information, her expression suddenly excited. [[5245 旁白 surprised]]
"You and I were both orphans taken in by Her Highness. I remember Her Highness had someone test our bloodlines when we were little. They said you were of mixed witch blood. It was so long ago, I almost forgot!" [[5246 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
But her excitement lasted only a few seconds before the gray-haired nun's face fell again. [[5247 旁白 sad]]
"But even with the witch's blood, we're still missing the werewolf's blood." [[5248 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
"I'll take care of that." [[5249 安德烈 neutral]]
A voice that was both surprising and not so surprising spoke up. [[5250 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone's gaze once again focused on the white-robed priest. The man's green eyes, like those of a poet, stared into the quiet depths of the water as he spoke slowly. [[5251 旁白 neutral]]
"Andre, I remember you're a pure human. Don't tell me you're a werewolf!" [[5252 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella felt her mind was in a jumble. Just a moment ago, it was confirmed that Andre had the dual identities of a Paladin and a Winterlein. Was he now going to reveal a werewolf bloodline too? [[5253 旁白 surprised]]
If that was the truth, this man's background was truly complicated! [[5254 旁白 surprised]]
