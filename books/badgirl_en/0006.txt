Chapter 6 Reset 6: Are These Reinforcements for Real? [[296 旁白 neutral]]
In the middle of the snowstorm, a beautiful figure surrounded by ice appeared, walking on a path of ice. [[297 旁白 neutral]]
She's here! After desperately calling for her in my heart, she's finally here! [[298 塞伦安 happy]]
The Ice Saintess, praised as having the purest bloodline, the strongest talent, and the most beautiful appearance in the history of the Glacies family—Serenia Glacies! [[299 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An was so excited he almost cried. At this moment, seeing her was like seeing his own mother. The world outside was too terrifying, the old succubus was too aggressive, starting with wild words, choking him, and then blowing in his ear. How could an innocent young man like him stand it? [[300 塞伦安 happy]]
Indeed, only a beautiful childhood friend can be trusted. [[301 塞伦安 neutral]]
Although, this childhood friend's purpose for coming here was to kill me... [[302 塞伦安 fearful]]
But dying at the hands of a beautiful girl is better than becoming a monster! [[303 塞伦安 neutral]]
Serenia wrapped Selen An's body in ice and snow, restricting his movement at the same time. [[304 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the Saintess who had suddenly appeared, a trace of fear flashed in the succubus Mara's eyes. It was clear that, as a former nun in her human days, she had certainly heard of the current Ice Saintess's reputation. [[305 旁白 fearful]]
As one of the Six Saintesses of the continent, the Ice Saintess was naturally different from the other five. When the other Saintesses held grand festivals, the Ice Saintess was slaying demons; when other Saintesses helped their followers, the Ice Saintess was slaying demons; when other Saintesses knelt before their gods in pious prayer, the Ice Saintess was still...slaying demons. [[306 旁白 neutral]]
And this habit seemed to be passed down through generations; every Ice Saintess was the same. [[307 旁白 neutral]]
Starting with the last one, she was either slaying demons or on her way to slay demons. It was more fitting to call her a god of slaughter than a Saintess. In terms of kill count, perhaps only the Fire Saintess, who worshipped war and glory, could compete. [[308 旁白 neutral]]
It was impossible to say there was no pressure when facing such a madwoman who killed demons without batting an eye. [[309 旁白 fearful]]
But she couldn't let her prize escape. The succubus Mara first glanced at Selen An, protected by the ice. Realizing her power couldn't break through the ice barrier, she quickly looked away and focused all her attention on the woman before her. [[310 玛拉 neutral]]
"The Saintess of the Glacies family, known to be the most talented in a hundred years..." [[311 玛拉 neutral]]
The succubus Mara wanted to start with a taunt to mock her opponent both mentally and physically, while also stalling for time to find an opening. [[312 旁白 neutral]]
But Serenia clearly wasn't going to give her that chance. [[313 旁白 neutral]]
Before Mara could finish her sentence, the figure that was at least fifty meters away had already become an afterimage. In a blur, a blade of extreme cold slashed towards her neck. [[314 旁白 neutral]]
It all happened in the blink of an eye. Attacked at close range, Mara retreated to dodge. Though her reaction was extremely fast, avoiding a fatal blow to the neck, the sharp edge of the blade still grazed her collarbone. [[315 旁白 neutral]]
A cut several centimeters long appeared on her deep purple skin, but no blood flowed out, because the icy poison from the blade had already contaminated the wound, spreading into her flesh. [[316 旁白 neutral]]
A vicious look flashed in the succubus's eyes. The nails on her unharmed right hand grew long and sharp, and without hesitation, she dug out the flesh tainted by the icy poison. Blood the same color as her skin trickled down and dripped onto the ground. [[317 旁白 angry]]
The scene instantly turned bloody, and the real battle had just begun. [[318 旁白 neutral]]
The beautiful, otherworldly ice maiden swung the ice sword in her hand, each strike aimed at a vital point. With her movements, an extreme cold constantly clung to and corroded Mara's skin and flesh, gradually slowing the flow of her blood. [[319 旁白 neutral]]
The clash of nails and sword blade rang out like metal striking metal. The movements of the woman and the demon were so fast they were nearly a blur. Trapped by the snow and ice, Selen An could barely see their condition, the real-life special effects, far more dazzling than on a screen, nearly blinding him. [[320 旁白 neutral]]
Holy crap, that's so damn cool! Is this real magic? [[321 塞伦安 surprised]]
If I can survive this... Coach, I want to learn! [[322 塞伦安 happy]]
Back when he was a player, his favorite character in the game was Serenia. To this day, he still remembered the stream of curses that had erupted from his mouth when he first saw her character art. [[323 旁白 neutral]]
Holy crap, silver hair! [[324 塞伦安 surprised]]
Holy crap, blue eyes! [[325 塞伦安 surprised]]
Holy crap, so pale! [[326 塞伦安 surprised]]
Holy crap, white stockings! [[327 塞伦安 surprised]]
Holy crap, an ice queen! [[328 塞伦安 surprised]]
Every detail was exactly to his liking. Every pixel of the Ice Saintess seemed to radiate a special charm just for him. Her very existence was a dance on his deepest preferences! [[329 旁白 neutral]]
And when the plot reached the point where Serenia was captured and forced by the demon general, along with her fallen childhood friend, to do those indescribable things in front of the human city gates, his mind didn't have any lewd thoughts. Instead, a rage he couldn't describe erupted in his chest. [[330 旁白 angry]]
It felt as if someone he liked in real life had been forcibly defiled for no reason. The most important reason he had stayed up all night playing the game was to try and find an alternate "if" route for Serenia's good end. [[331 旁白 sad]]
As a result, he stayed up too long and died suddenly in front of his computer, only to be reincarnated into this game. [[332 旁白 neutral]]
The fight between the succubus and the beautiful girl was a feast for the eyes—dazzling light effects, speeds so fast only afterimages remained. Although it lacked the visceral punch-for-punch satisfaction of a boxing match, the clash of magic and swords was a scene every boy dreamed of! [[333 旁白 happy]]
The battle wasn't the stalemate he expected, but a one-sided affair. Mara was consistently pushed back by Serenia. Her exposed skin was either covered in thick white frost or cut by the sharp edge of the sword, dripping with blood. [[334 旁白 neutral]]
As expected of one of the most skilled Saintesses in combat, after just a few exchanges, Mara couldn't hold on any longer. She had multiple injuries, and blood carrying the thick scent of desire splattered on the ground. [[335 旁白 neutral]]
Realizing that her head would sooner or later be taken by this emotionless Saintess if she continued to fight, Mara suddenly spread the small demon wings on her back and flew up! [[336 旁白 surprised]]
Serenia raised her sword, pointing it at the succubus in the air, her ice-blue eyes devoid of warmth. [[337 旁白 neutral]]
"Traitor, die!" [[338 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
She issued it like a command, making Mara, in the air, tremble. [[339 旁白 neutral]]
She finally didn't dare to linger any longer. She shot a vicious glare at the silver-haired girl, then looked at Selen An, who was protected by the ice, with a strange smile. [[340 旁白 neutral]]
"You can't escape, Master. My current state is your future. It's destined. You can't escape!" [[341 玛拉 angry]]
With that, before Serenia could react, a pair of bat-like wings flapped rapidly, and her figure quickly vanished from sight. [[342 旁白 neutral]]
Serenia just stood leaning on her sword, watching the figure disappear completely, but she didn't give chase. [[343 旁白 neutral]]
Demons were like that. No matter how much blood they lost in battle, whether their abdomen was pierced or their chest was cut open, as long as their head wasn't chopped off, they were very hard to kill. [[344 旁白 neutral]]
But as troublesome as it was, as a Saintess with the divine blood of the God of Ice, a symbol of judgment and moderation, Serenia could skillfully dissect her into a pile of parts. But there was no need, because her main objective this time was right beside her. [[345 旁白 neutral]]
She turned and walked step by step toward Selen An. [[346 旁白 neutral]]
The ice storm swirling around the young man finally dispersed, allowing Selen An, a devoted fan of Serenia in his past life, to see the girl's true appearance so clearly and up close for the first time. [[347 旁白 neutral]]
"Serenia..." [[348 塞伦安 neutral]]
He couldn't help but call out her name. Before he could say anything more, or even react, before he had enough time to admire her face, the cold edge of a sword was already silently resting on his neck. [[349 旁白 fearful]]
