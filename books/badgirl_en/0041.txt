Chapter 41: Reset 41 - Will You Be My Enemy? [[2364 旁白 neutral]]
In the ancient beginning, elements formed the most basic framework of the world. [[2365 旁白 neutral]]
The gods were born from these elements. They mastered a supreme power called the Law, a force of order completely opposite to the original chaos. The gods then lifted the carving knife of order and, upon the rough shape of the new world, sculpted the sky, the land, and the sea. [[2366 旁白 neutral]]
After finishing the first creation, the gods looked upon the magnificent world and did not want such a perfect work to remain silent. So, they created life according to their own preferences. From then on, life spread to every corner of the world, and guided by fate, it created its own unique civilizations. [[2367 旁白 neutral]]
Today, on the continent of Nephalem, there are many different races, and most of them believe in different gods. But when thinking about the origin of life, even the blessed races who have the favor of the gods would undoubtedly think of that merciful deity—the God of Water, who governs life and peace. [[2368 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, this knowledge didn't just pop into Kegesa's mind because he was bored or daydreaming. It also wasn't because he was beaten so badly that he was dizzy and confused. [[2369 旁白 neutral]]
He just stared blankly at the scroll in his hand. Even though he was standing under the burning sun, he felt an unusual chill deep inside. [[2370 旁白 fearful]]
As a high-ranking demon of noble blood from the Demon Realm, Kegesa had a long life. When a race or individual lives for a long time, their brain naturally gathers a lot of knowledge, even without trying to learn. Kegesa considered this knowledge his combat experience, and it had often helped him overcome difficult situations. [[2371 旁白 neutral]]
But now, as he searched through all his memories and knowledge, he was horrified to find that there was very little information or rumors about the abilities of the Water Saintess. [[2372 旁白 fearful]]
Although the Winterlein family was one of the Church's six great Saintess families, along with the other five, there was nothing known about the Water Saintess's abilities, except for what everyone on the continent knew: she had mastered the strongest arts of healing and purification. Beyond that, there was nothing. [[2373 旁白 surprised]]
The Demon Realm, which was always very cautious about the six Saintesses, seemed to focus most of its attention on the other five families. As for the Water Saintess and her Winterlein family, the demons just treated them as support-class priests who could heal. [[2374 旁白 neutral]]
The priest profession was often the one most looked down upon by the demons. After all, on a battlefield that was like a meat grinder, death was often instant and injuries were common. Weak humans needed immediate treatment from a priest after being hurt to stop their wounds from getting worse, or their lives would be in danger. [[2375 旁白 neutral]]
But the demons didn't have this worry. Their powerful life force and regenerative abilities meant that most demons were not afraid of pain. Except for a few fatal wounds, physical pain would only excite their bloodlust and greatly increase their combat power. [[2376 旁白 neutral]]
In the eyes of the demons, healing magic was completely useless and a waste of time. Priests who specialized in it were just another word for weak and incompetent. [[2377 旁白 neutral]]
At least, that's what he personally thought. But now, as he faced the Water Saintess directly, he felt a difficulty that he had never experienced before in his life. [[2378 旁白 fearful]]
The girl in front of him didn't seem to be doing anything, yet Kegesa felt an indescribable sense of powerlessness. [[2379 旁白 fearful]]
He tried to put more magic into the scroll in his hand. The magic flowed freely inside his body, but the magic he sent into the scroll was like a stone sinking into the sea. The scroll, covered in forbidden runes, didn't react at all, as if he were holding a fake. [[2380 旁白 fearful]]
Throwing away the scroll, he tried to cast a spell directly. But whenever an attack spell came to mind, his throat felt like it was blocked by an invisible stone. No matter how hard he tried, his face turning red, he couldn't speak a single syllable. [[2381 旁白 fearful]]
Finally, he looked at his own hands. He drew his demon-forged dagger and pointed the tip at his own palm. His Hellfire Eye, burning with flames, narrowed. Without hesitation, he stabbed the dagger toward his palm, but... [[2382 旁白 surprised]]
The pain he expected never came. The tip of the blade stopped just a hair's breadth from his palm. No matter how much force he used, the blade wouldn't move any further. [[2383 旁白 surprised]]
Finally, he dropped the dagger, his face as pale as ash, and looked at the blue-haired Saintess, who was as calm as still water. [[2384 旁白 fearful]]
The battle had lost all meaning at this point. On a battlefield where no one could get hurt and no blood could be spilled, neither side could use violence to get what they wanted. [[2385 旁白 fearful]]
He couldn't even harm himself, let alone kill the enemy. This strange feeling, as if his own life was not under his control, made Kegesa feel a long-forgotten fear. He even started to regret coming here... [[2386 旁白 fearful]]
If he hadn't accepted the Demon King's order, he wouldn't have given that useless kid from the Winterlein family a second thought. It was a Saintess family with little combat power, and its current heir couldn't even awaken his bloodline. Such a worthless ant didn't deserve any of his attention. [[2387 旁白 angry]]
If only His Majesty the Demon King hadn't been planning this for so long, if only His Majesty hadn't insisted on sending him here, if only... [[2388 旁白 sad]]
The battle seemed to have reached a strange stalemate. Serenia watched it all unfold. She stared at the Saintess's holy and compassionate back for a long moment before finally speaking. [[2389 旁白 neutral]]
"Lobelia..." [[2390 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
The ability of the girl before her was not only despairing for Kegesa, but it was also completely beyond her expectations. Even as Selen An's childhood friend, she never knew that the line of the Water Saintess possessed such an "unbeatable" power. [[2391 旁白 surprised]]
It didn't need any reason, any threat of force, or even the agreement of the two sides on the battlefield. It just forcibly ended the war... No, that's not quite right. It forcibly made the war meaningless. [[2392 旁白 neutral]]
A battlefield without bloodshed, could it still be called a battlefield? [[2393 旁白 neutral]]
At least until now, Serenia had never considered a situation that was supposed to be impossible. [[2394 旁白 neutral]]
But unbeatable as it was, a new problem had now emerged. [[2395 旁白 neutral]]
The fight couldn't continue, but what about the result? [[2396 旁白 neutral]]
Just like now, Kegesa had completely lost the will to fight. But as a high-ranking demon of the Demon Realm, his duty and his pride would not allow him to retreat. Even if he couldn't fight, he would wait it out. [[2397 旁白 neutral]]
And her side could only do the same: see who runs out of patience first, see who retreats first. [[2398 旁白 neutral]]
If that was the case, the outcome of the war would depend on whose reinforcements arrived first. After all, the battlefield Lobelia could control had a limited range. As long as one went around the area of the "Pact of No War," the battle could still go on. [[2399 旁白 neutral]]
As if sensing Serenia's doubts and worries, Lobelia, who had been holding her holy sword in a prayer for peace, suddenly opened her eyes. She turned her head and said softly to reassure her. [[2400 旁白 neutral]]
"Do not worry." [[2401 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Then she turned back, and for the first time, her watery blue eyes lost their look of love and pity. They became quiet like a still tide, holding a divine quality that was hard to describe. [[2402 旁白 neutral]]
"Will you be my enemy?" [[2403 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Her voice was not loud, but it sounded directly in the minds of every intelligent creature within the area. [[2404 旁白 neutral]]
Kegesa's body froze, and then he suddenly burst out laughing. [[2405 克格萨 happy]]
"Water Saintess, I admit I can't break your ability. But that doesn't mean you can kill me. I bet you absolutely do not dare, and absolutely cannot, make a move." [[2406 克格萨 happy]]
The despair of not being able to cause harm may have completely taken away his will to fight, but Kegesa had not lost his mind. He understood very well that the biggest weakness of this seemingly unbeatable "Pact of No War" was the Water Saintess herself. [[2407 旁白 neutral]]
As long as the Water Saintess attacked first and broke the balance, then this "Pact of No War," which was as powerful as a law of the world, would be broken. [[2408 旁白 neutral]]
The more powerful the magic, the more powerful the divine art, the greater the price and limitations it must have. A Saintess of peace can forbid fighting on a battlefield, but she also cannot raise her sword to kill an enemy in that same domain. [[2409 旁白 neutral]]
