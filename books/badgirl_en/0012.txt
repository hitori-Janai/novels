Chapter 12: Reset 12 - Sin [[713 旁白 neutral]]
Facing this kind mother, he finally couldn't stay silent. [[714 旁白 neutral]]
"Andre, my name is Andre." [[715 塞伦安 neutral]]
He didn't have to think hard; he just opened his mouth, and the very ordinary name came out. [[716 旁白 neutral]]
"Andre? What a brave child." [[717 安娜母亲 happy]]
The expression on Anna's mother's face grew even kinder. [[718 旁白 neutral]]
But the more kindness he received from the mother and daughter, the more his guilt grew. Memories of his evil deeds played in his mind like a slideshow. [[719 旁白 sad]]
The woman's smile and the girl's silence struck his heart again and again, and he felt as if he were about to be drowned by a tide of guilt. [[720 旁白 sad]]
He wanted to apologize, or rather, apologize for the body's original owner, but he didn't dare. He was afraid apologizing would reveal his identity and that the kind mother and daughter would throw him out if they knew the truth. [[721 旁白 fearful]]
He wanted to live, so he could only lower his head in shame, letting guilt and sin wash over him. [[722 旁白 fearful]]
"Ma'am, it's so late. Aren't you worried about Miss Anna being out alone?" [[723 塞伦安 neutral]]
Noticing the fading light from the crack in the door, Selen An realized night was coming. He looked at the woman on the bed and asked. [[724 旁白 neutral]]
"Every mother worries about her child, but Mr. Andre, as you can see, I am pregnant and can only stay in bed. The whole family depends on Anna..." [[725 安娜母亲 sad]]
"As for my husband, Anna's father, I'm sure you can guess, Mr. Andre. He is no longer alive. He was cruelly murdered." [[726 安娜母亲 sad]]
Anna's mother's voice was gentle and calm, as if a family breaking apart, a wife losing her husband, and a daughter losing her father were completely normal. [[727 旁白 sad]]
"I'm sorry..." [[728 塞伦安 sad]]
In the dim light, Selen An lowered his head. [[729 旁白 sad]]
"Mr. Andre, you don't have to be. You did nothing wrong. Life can be cruel, but that's how it is. Ordinary people like us are used to it. Just being able to live is the most we can hope for." [[730 安娜母亲 sad]]
"Ma'am... do you hate the person who caused you to lose your husband and ruined your family?" [[731 塞伦安 fearful]]
Suddenly, the young man looked up and asked the question as if compelled by something. [[732 旁白 neutral]]
But as soon as he asked, he regretted it. What a stupid question. [[733 旁白 neutral]]
How could she not hate him? If he were in her place, he would probably hate that villain Selen An for the rest of his life. [[734 旁白 angry]]
"Hate him? Maybe I do..." [[735 安娜母亲 sad]]
The woman looked at her pregnant belly, sadness filling her beautiful eyes. [[736 旁白 sad]]
"That young master killed my husband because he wanted my daughter. He made it so my child will be born without a father." [[737 安娜母亲 sad]]
"But I don't feel that much hatred in my heart." [[738 安娜母亲 sad]]
Selen An was stunned. He looked at her tear-filled eyes with deep confusion. [[739 旁白 surprised]]
"Why?" [[740 塞伦安 surprised]]
"Because I don't dare. When faced with power and wealth, I can't even feel too much hate, even though they killed my husband..." [[741 安娜母亲 fearful]]
"My husband died protecting our daughter, but I can't do what he did. I have a child waiting to be born. I have a feeling it's a boy..." [[742 安娜母亲 sad]]
"He will be his father's legacy. As a wife, I should follow my husband and get revenge. But as a mother, I can't let my unborn child die because of its parents before it even has a chance to live." [[743 安娜母亲 sad]]
"Cough, cough, cough—" [[744 安娜母亲 neutral]]
After she spoke, the woman on the bed started coughing violently. Selen An stood up, worried, but the sudden movement made his wounds hurt badly. [[745 旁白 fearful]]
He fought through the pain and tried to get her a cup of water, but there was only a single pot on the stove. He had no choice but to pat her back with his one good hand. [[746 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry..." [[747 塞伦安 sad]]
"Cough... You don't need to apologize, Mr. Andre. You are a good person." [[748 安娜母亲 neutral]]
The coughing made the woman's face turn an unhealthy red. She breathed weakly, but her eyes were still gentle. [[749 旁白 neutral]]
"..." [[750 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An said nothing and just kept patting the woman's back. [[751 旁白 neutral]]
No, Selen An (I) am a bastard. [[752 旁白 angry]]
The thought echoed in his mind. When Anna's mother stopped coughing, he sat back down. [[753 旁白 neutral]]
"Since you were harmed by a villain, why not move to another city? The empire is huge. The Craigmore wasteland is too harsh, it's hard to even survive here..." [[754 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Because no one comes here to collect taxes." [[755 安娜母亲 neutral]]
"..." [[756 塞伦安 surprised]]
Selen An was silent again. [[757 旁白 neutral]]
When he played the game, he only cared about the story and the sexy CGs. But now, living in this adult game world, he finally understood how cruel this continent of sex, blood, and violence was for ordinary people. [[758 旁白 sad]]
And the one who pushed this mother and son to this point was himself. [[759 旁白 sad]]
Right now, he was in no mood to argue with himself about whether he was really Selen An. None of it mattered anymore... [[760 旁白 sad]]
Because he was the one controlling this body, with all of Selen An's memories. And the hands of this body had truly committed unforgivable crimes. [[761 旁白 sad]]
He suddenly wanted to do something for this mother, as a way to atone for himself—no, for the body's original owner. He could consider it the price for taking over this body. [[762 旁白 neutral]]
He started searching his clothes. His jacket was torn and was being used as a blanket, so anything in its pockets was likely gone. Luckily, his pants pockets were intact. [[763 旁白 neutral]]
After searching all over, Selen An gathered a dozen gold coins and several dozen silver coins and pushed them into the woman's hands. [[764 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Andre, I-I can't take these!" [[765 安娜母亲 surprised]]
The woman quickly shook her head and refused. [[766 安娜母亲 neutral]]
"No, you should take them. Your daughter saved my life, and you let me stay here, giving me a safe place for a while. You deserve this." [[767 塞伦安 neutral]]
"But this is too much. We only used a few herbs, which my daughter picked herself. They're not worth this much..." [[768 安娜母亲 neutral]]
She still wouldn't accept it, but the young man's next word stopped her. [[769 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Yes!" [[770 塞伦安 neutral]]
"You saved my life. No amount of money is enough to repay that. This is all I have on me. Please, take it. Otherwise..." [[771 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Otherwise, I'll be too ashamed to stay in this house any longer." [[772 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An's tone and expression were so sincere and firm that the woman felt he would really leave if she didn't accept the money. [[773 旁白 neutral]]
He was still injured, and the wasteland was extremely dangerous at night. [[774 旁白 fearful]]
Finally, her heart softened and she took the money, but only ten silver coins. Selen An tried to insist, but this time, it was Anna's mother who was firm. [[775 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Andre, if you insist, then I won't take a single copper coin." [[776 安娜母亲 neutral]]
"I..." [[777 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I'm only taking this money because my small family really needs it. The baby will be born soon, and Anna has suffered a lot taking care of me. These silver coins will help us get through this difficult time..." [[778 安娜母亲 sad]]
"But Mr. Andre, you should understand that we didn't save you for money. If we took all of this, it would go against why we helped you in the first place." [[779 安娜母亲 neutral]]
"Thank you so much for your help. Your character is just like your name: you are a kind and brave person." [[780 安娜母亲 happy]]
"May the goddess bless you." [[781 安娜母亲 happy]]
The woman's sincere blessing echoed in his ears. The young man just looked down and said nothing. [[782 旁白 sad]]
Because only he knew whether Selen An was a good person. As for the praise that he was like his name—even the name Andre was fake. Did he really deserve such praise? [[783 旁白 sad]]
