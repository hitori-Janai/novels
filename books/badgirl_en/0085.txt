Chapter 85: I'm Very Curious [[4812 旁白 neutral]]
    "Good morning, Mr. Andre." [[4813 墨莺 neutral]]
    "Good morning, Miss Moying." [[4814 旁白 neutral]]
    It was another new day full of hope. In the church hall, Andre, who had just returned from his morning run, was wiping sweat from his forehead with a towel, when a pleasant girlish voice came from behind him. [[4815 旁白 neutral]]
    He turned his head and saw Moying, already dressed, and Isabella, who rarely slept until the sun was high, following her. The girl's voice was clear and pure, and her morning greeting seemed to make one look forward to the beauty of the day even more. [[4816 旁白 neutral]]
    Although there wasn't much change in Andre's expression, he had to admit that whenever he interacted with Miss Moying, his mood would unconsciously become happier, and the smile on his face would increase. This situation also happened to Lobelia. [[4817 旁白 neutral]]
    Such a coincidence made Andre wonder if all Saintesses had an extremely high affinity, or why else were they all so likable? [[4818 旁白 neutral]]
    "Today is also a beautiful day. Being able to spend a few days here with Mr. Andre will surely be an unforgettable experience." [[4819 墨莺 happy]]
    The green-haired girl stood by the statue of the Wind God, her emerald eyes adorned with the clearest light in the world. [[4820 旁白 neutral]]
    Her sincere words, spoken in her voice, were like humming a cheerful little tune. [[4821 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is that so? Miss Moying overpraises me. I am just an ordinary priest, guarding the believers and promises in this inconspicuous small town. Such a simple life probably won't have any unforgettable experiences." [[4822 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre responded calmly, as usual, he went to the statue, took three incense sticks, lit them, bowed three times, and inserted them into the incense burner. After quietly chanting "Amen," his daily prayer was completed. [[4823 旁白 neutral]]
    During this process, Moying stood quietly to the side, watching Andre's slightly strange prayer ritual with interest, but uncharacteristically, she didn't ask any questions. [[4824 旁白 neutral]]
    Instead, after Andre finished, the girl also imitated his movements and went through the process. Apart from the significant difference in Andre's and the girl's stature, their movements and details were almost identical. [[4825 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre watched this scene with a slight surprise, and he couldn't help but marvel in his heart: [[4826 旁白 surprised]]
    As expected of the Saintess chosen by the Wind God, she understands freedom. [[4827 旁白 neutral]]
    After performing the ritual herself, the girl raised her head and asked with a charming smile, blinking her clever eyes. [[4828 旁白 neutral]]
    "Mr. Andre, this prayer process is quite interesting. It adds a special sense of ritual compared to the default prayer process." [[4829 墨莺 happy]]
    "As long as Miss Moying likes it." [[4830 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre responded calmly. [[4831 旁白 neutral]]
    "But there's one thing I don't quite understand. May I ask you about it?" [[4832 墨莺 neutral]]
    "Speak freely." [[4833 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Mr. Andre, what does the 'Amen' you chanted at the end of your prayer mean?" [[4834 墨莺 neutral]]
    "..." [[4835 旁白 neutral]]
    "I'm sorry, I'm just genuinely curious. If it's inconvenient for Mr. Andre to answer, you don't have to..." [[4836 墨莺 neutral]]
    "No, it's not inconvenient at all. The meaning of 'Amen' is actually very simple: it's simply a respectful address to my Lord, the Wind God. Because in my opinion, directly calling the Wind God by his bright name is an act of blasphemy. 'Amen' is my unique respectful or endearing term for the Wind God." [[4837 安德烈 neutral]]
    The initial silence wasn't because Andre didn't want to answer Moying's question. People had asked him similar questions before, even Isabella had asked something similar, and he had always made up various excuses to fob them off. But this time, he had to explain the question in front of the Wind God's representative on earth, the noble Wind Saintess. [[4838 旁白 neutral]]
    So this time, the fabricated answer wasn't as casual as before, but was a rigorous, cobbled-together answer after more than ten seconds of thought, combining various elements from his previous life. [[4839 旁白 neutral]]
    This explanation might not make sense in the territories of other Saintesses, but in the land favored by the Wind God, it made perfect sense. After all, the Wind God is free, whether it's "Amen" "A-men" or "B-men," as long as you pray with reverence, the Wind God will be tolerant of your actions. [[4840 旁白 neutral]]
    As for whether an endearing term would be too disrespectful? [[4841 旁白 neutral]]
    Come on, besides freedom and wisdom, the most important part of the Wind God's teachings is that God loves the world, and people can also love God. The Wind God himself has passed down this meaning. My respect for the Wind God is incredibly profound, so what's wrong with adding an endearing term? [[4842 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh~ so that's how it is." [[4843 墨莺 neutral]]
    The girl gently stroked her chin, her twin pigtails swaying slightly on either side. [[4844 旁白 neutral]]
    "Alright, I understand now. But indeed, just as Sister Isabella said in her letter, Mr. Andre is a very interesting person!" [[4845 墨莺 happy]]
    "Did she really write that in her letter?" [[4846 安德烈 surprised]]
    "Really, truer than pearls!" [[4847 墨莺 happy]]
    The girl stared with her bright, almond-shaped eyes, her sweet and pleasant voice making it hard to doubt her. [[4848 旁白 neutral]]
    If it were anyone else, they might have believed her, but unfortunately, this person was Andre, and he had long since figured out the dramatic tactics of the Wind God's lineage. [[4849 旁白 neutral]]
    Looking up, he met Isabella's eyes, who was standing behind the girl. A subtle curve appeared at the corner of the man's mouth, his expression as if asking Isabella with his eyes, "Is what she said true?" [[4850 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella, uncharacteristically, did not show her usual lazy or indifferent expression. Her polite and proper smile was flawless, but her slightly narrowed fox-like eyes subtly revealed that she must be fiercely "praising" Andre in her heart at this moment. [[4851 旁白 neutral]]
    The two gazed at each other for a long time. Finally, Isabella found it difficult to maintain her graceful and virtuous smile, rolled her eyes, and gave Andre a forced smile. [[4852 旁白 neutral]]
    Moying seemed to sense something and turned to look back, but what she saw was still the gentle and virtuous Sister Isabella, the gray-haired beauty whose smile was perfect and impeccable. [[4853 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre, who had witnessed this scene completely, silently scoffed in his heart. [[4854 旁白 neutral]]
    Hmph, fickle woman~ [[4855 旁白 angry]]
    Female clergy members of the Wind God's lineage, from Saintesses to nuns, are indeed all the same. [[4856 旁白 angry]]
    But these words were, of course, just internal complaints. Complaining was fine; as the current temporary "supreme authority" of the Kempfa Church, he still had to show the demeanor of a host. [[4857 旁白 neutral]]
    "May I ask, Miss Moying, have you rested well these past two days? Is the arranged room comfortable? And is the food acceptable?" [[4858 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre asked, probing repeatedly, like a service industry worker from his previous life, while Miss Moying smiled and nodded, indicating that everything was fine. [[4859 旁白 neutral]]
    Just as Andre breathed a sigh of relief, preparing to have Isabella lead her master to explore the town and enjoy the pastoral scenery while he went back to his own business, the other party suddenly called out to him. [[4860 旁白 neutral]]
    "Mr. Andre, I wonder if there is a nun named Evelyn in this church?" [[4861 墨莺 neutral]]
    Andre's back suddenly trembled, and his body stiffened slightly. [[4862 旁白 fearful]]
    Although he had expected it, he didn't expect this master and servant to be so direct. He had rested for a whole day yesterday, and today was their first formal conversation and meeting. He didn't expect them to be unable to wait even a day? [[4863 旁白 fearful]]
    No, he must remain calm. He was the first layer of insurance for Evelyn's identity; if anything went wrong, it would directly threaten the safety of Evelyn's identity. [[4864 旁白 fearful]]
    With this thought, Andre quickly adjusted his facial expression, turned around, and revealed a benevolent smile. [[4865 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course, Sister Evelyn is the star of our church." [[4866 安德烈 happy]]
    "Star?" [[4867 墨莺 surprised]]
    "It means the best. Evelyn is widely recognized as the best nun in our church. I just don't know if Miss Moying has something important to ask her?" [[4868 安德烈 neutral]]
    "It's nothing urgent. I just visited the town briefly yesterday, and among the town residents, besides Mr. Andre, Miss Evelyn's name appeared the most frequently. I'm quite surprised by Miss Evelyn's reputation, so I'm very curious about her now~" [[4869 墨莺 neutral]]
    Moying clasped her hands behind her back, leaning slightly forward. The girl's figure, developing between graceful and youthful, fully displayed the beauty of youth. This scene could have been painted at the moment, but Andre's brow suddenly twitched. [[4870 旁白 fearful]]
    This tone... why did he feel an inexplicable sense of foreboding? [[4871 旁白 fearful]]
