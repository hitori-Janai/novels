Chapter 78 Division of Labor [[4421 旁白 neutral]]
    "If you insist that this is the truth, then let it be so for now." [[4422 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing Isabella's determined look, Andre, who had just gone through a fierce battle, had no extra strength to argue with her. [[4423 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, what if he won the argument? [[4424 旁白 neutral]]
    As Isabella said, there were indeed many suspicious points about him. If he didn't explain it with the identity of the Ice Saintess's chief paladin, she would inevitably dig deeper. This time it was a misjudgment, but what if next time she really found out something big? [[4425 旁白 fearful]]
    Any of his remaining two identities, if exposed, would be enough to give him a headache. [[4426 旁白 fearful]]
    So, he might as well go with the flow and borrow the title of chief paladin. [[4427 旁白 neutral]]
    During their conversation, the vampires, sensing something was wrong, had gathered all their forces. At this moment, noble blood kin and lowly ghouls mixed together, with different skin tones but the same bloody eyes, all filled with a thirst for slaughter and greed for fresh blood. [[4428 旁白 neutral]]
    Dawn was approaching, and they didn't have much time left. If they were ordinary vampires, with their cunning, they would have fled long ago after realizing something was amiss, but they were under orders not to retreat. [[4429 旁白 neutral]]
    Once they retreated, they would not be stepping onto the path of life, but falling into an abyss more terrifying than death. [[4430 旁白 fearful]]
    For this, all they could do was to unleash the bloodlust in their veins as much as possible, use their numerical advantage to tear apart the two people blocking their way, and then quickly bloodbath the entire town! [[4431 旁白 angry]]
    A dense crowd of monsters surrounded them from all directions. Isabella stood up from behind the ice wall, reaching out to help Andre. [[4432 旁白 neutral]]
    "Can you still fight?" [[4433 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    The man did not refuse the nun's help and stood up with her hand. [[4434 旁白 neutral]]
    Stepping onto the mound once again and overlooking the densely packed swarm of monsters, Andre felt a strange sense of peace in his heart. [[4435 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps it was because he had just been healed, or perhaps because this time he had a companion to rely on behind him, and no longer had to fear being attacked from both front and back. [[4436 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course, these monsters who attempt to violate Kempfa must be completely annihilated!" [[4437 安德烈 angry]]
    "Well said, I haven't fought in a long time either. This time, let's consider it a warm-up before returning to my original job!" [[4438 陌生女1 happy]]
    Under the slanted moonlit sky, the silver-haired priest crossed his two blades, sparks flying, vowing to judge the sinners with the cross. [[4439 旁白 neutral]]
    In the bloody night, the gray-haired nun stood with her robe spread, her slender hand touching her faintly visible thigh root covered by the skirt. A silver cross pendant shone brightly, and with a flick of her delicate hand, the cross pendant grew with the wind, transforming into a long and sharp jitte! [[4440 旁白 neutral]]
    The two stood back-to-back, fighting together. Even facing a hundred times their numbers in the human world, they remained fearless. [[4441 旁白 neutral]]
    The priest wielded his two swords like a silver moon cutting through the sky, exhaling a cold gleam. In an instant, enemies within ten steps of him were severed and bled out. [[4442 旁白 neutral]]
    Even after fighting all night, after a brief rest and resupply, the fatigue in the man's eyes disappeared, and his ferocity and wildness in battle were undiminished compared to when he started. [[4443 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella, fighting back-to-back, felt the man's surging and unyielding fighting spirit behind her, and couldn't help but marvel at Andre's incredibly powerful physique. Such stamina and recovery speed, even for a human body, were almost comparable to that of a legendary robust werewolf, right? [[4444 旁白 surprised]]
    While thinking, as one of the twelve holy nuns personally appointed by the Wind Saintess, Isabella did not neglect her own battle situation at all. However, compared to Andre's wild close-combat style, although she held a cold weapon, every swing of her hand unleashed wind blades that harvested heads in swathes, like sickles in a wheat field. [[4445 旁白 neutral]]
    One was an extreme single-target burst, and the other was an extreme large-area AoE. Although it was their first time fighting together, they had a very tacit division of labor. [[4446 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella cleverly used wind magic to push the rushing vampires towards Andre at the right time, and the blue vortexes acted like a sieve, pulling a large number of ghouls towards her front. [[4447 旁白 neutral]]
    In this way, the difficult elite monsters that could not be killed with one blow were subtly sent to Andre, who specialized in anti-vampire combat. These cunning monsters lost their minds in anger and rushed over with the main ghoul force. The crowded environment made them lose their agility advantage, and thus were killed by the silver-haired priest, who had recovered his blood and wits, with a single slash. [[4448 旁白 neutral]]
    As for the time-consuming, physically demanding, and numerous ghouls, Isabella's large-scale wind magic could also very effectively cut them down in swathes. [[4449 旁白 neutral]]
    A vast undead army, in less than an hour, only a few scattered lucky ones squeezed to the back remained standing on the battlefield besides the two of them. [[4450 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps they were scared silly by this bloody slaughtering hell, or perhaps their desire for life made them temporarily forget the cost of escape. These blood kin, who prided themselves on their nobility, abandoned their previous arrogance, and a few scattered ones scurried away like stray dogs. [[4451 旁白 neutral]]
    But since coming was so easy, why would leaving be so simple? [[4452 旁白 neutral]]
    The vampires who wanted to escape, whether on the ground or in the air, were all without exception bounced back by the wind wall Isabella had erected. [[4453 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre's gunblade was like a silver light arrow, precisely piercing the heads of the lucky ones, blood and brains splattering everywhere. But such a bloody scene was nothing compared to the ground already soaked in blood. [[4454 旁白 neutral]]
    Several headless corpses softly fell into the pile of bodies, and the vampires whose heads were blown off by the gunblade had no chance of revival. [[4455 旁白 neutral]]
    In the end, only one vampire remained on the battlefield. This was not due to the two of them overlooking it, but was intentional. [[4456 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre did not throw his gunblade at him. This vampire, already scared out of his wits, only dared to shiver and curl up in the pile of corpses, feigning death. [[4457 旁白 fearful]]
    But Isabella's wind magic perception had already locked onto him. As the girl casually hooked her finger and made an upward gesture, the flowing wind condensed into invisible ropes, tightly binding the escaped fish and hanging him upside down in mid-air. [[4458 旁白 neutral]]
    "How is it? My wind ropes are pretty good, aren't they?" [[4459 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
    Isabella put her hands on her hips proudly. [[4460 旁白 happy]]
    "Hmm, from the current performance, it barely doesn't disgrace the title of Holy Nun." [[4461 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre nodded and walked towards the last surviving vampire. [[4462 旁白 neutral]]
    He roughly estimated in his mind that judging from the magic power concentration Isabella briefly exposed just now, the opponent was at least a fourth-order Archmage. [[4463 旁白 neutral]]
    One could only say, as expected of the Saintess's personal guard? [[4464 旁白 neutral]]
    Such strength, if assigned to a local area, would be enough to become a bishop of considerable standing. The position of bishop could be considered high-ranking in the Church, yet Isabella would rather give up a high-level position to become a holy nun... [[4465 旁白 surprised]]
    It could only be said that the Saintess's influence and the unity and power she gathered were even greater than he had imagined! [[4466 旁白 surprised]]
    Speaking of which, having such a powerful subordinate is also quite good. If there's work, the nun does it. If there's no work, do the nun... ahem, when there's nothing to do, having such a beauty swaying before his eyes is also a feast for the eyes. [[4467 旁白 neutral]]
    More importantly, both the Holy Nun and the Holy Knight sign an equal soul contract with the Saintess. The value of the soul contract guarantees that neither the master nor the servant will betray each other! [[4468 旁白 neutral]]
    He also wanted to have such absolutely loyal beautiful girl subordinates. If he did, he wouldn't have had to desperately clean up the dirty things alone tonight. [[4469 旁白 sad]]
    Logically speaking, he could actually have them, but he would have to change his skin and identity. However, thinking of his own family, he immediately dispelled that idea. [[4470 旁白 sad]]
    The traitors in the family had not yet been eliminated. To quickly have his own Holy Knights or Holy Nuns, he would have to rely on the power of the Saintess's family. But going home, thinking about what he had experienced before, those executioners hidden in the shadows, could he really 100% avoid their backstabbing from the dark? [[4471 旁白 fearful]]
    Moreover, he had never returned to his family and the Church in the guise and identity of the Saintess. After all, the greater the power the Saintess possessed, in a sense, the greater the constraints she was under. [[4472 旁白 neutral]]
    He, as a sinner, was not suitable to atone for his sins while bound by worldly shackles. [[4473 旁白 sad]]
    Lost in these thoughts, the man had already arrived in front of the vampire hanging upside down by the wind ropes. Their red and green eyes met, and the world seemed to fall silent in that second... [[4474 旁白 neutral]]
