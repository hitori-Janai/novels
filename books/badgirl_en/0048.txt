Chapter 48: The Gunblade Priest [[2738 旁白 neutral]]
    After paying his respects to the old man, Andre did not immediately return to the church. [[2739 旁白 neutral]]
    Since Isabella was willing to cover his shift for half a day, he was happy to take a break and check on his recent progress. [[2740 旁白 neutral]]
    He saw his index finger slide upwards into thin air, and a faint golden light flashed in his vision. An epic-feeling golden panel slowly appeared, and the content on it was very different from before. [[2741 旁白 neutral]]

    ... [[2763 旁白 neutral]]
    Class Skills: [[2764 旁白 neutral]]
    Master of All Weapons (Talent Skill) [All kinds of weapons in the world can be used by you. Even a tree branch can exhibit the sharpness of a treasured sword in your hands. Note that when using your specialized weapon, the gunblade, it will cause extra damage to dark-aligned creatures or undead.] [[2765 旁白 neutral]]
    "Every master has their strengths and weaknesses, it's normal." [[2766 旁白 neutral]]
    "What about you, Master Ye?" [[2767 旁白 neutral]]
    "I understand a little bit of everything." (Humble.jpg) [[2768 旁白 neutral]]
    Discipline (Mental Magic) [Pious faith requires discipline and adherence to rules. After using this skill, you can choose to cast it on a single target or a group. Upon hitting, the skill will forcefully seal any of the target's skills and is guaranteed to weaken the opponent's racial talent effect. If the enemy target is higher than your level, the skill effect will be proportionally weakened.] [[2769 旁白 neutral]]
    Dual A in Strength and Speed (Unlock Skill) [Triggered after using Discipline on oneself. Greatly reduces one's spell effects, reduces Magic Power attribute to D+, and temporarily increases Strength and Speed attributes to A. After Discipline is解除d, all attribute levels return to normal.] [[2770 旁白 neutral]]
    "Dual A in Strength and Speed, is this the power of Star Platinum? Interesting." [[2771 旁白 neutral]]

    Sword of Peace (Unsealed) [Proof of the Water Deity's Agent, symbolizing peace, never sharpened. "The blade has no edge, for true peace requires no slaughter" - inscribed on the hilt is the teardrop-shaped clear eye of the Water Deity from the first Saintess.] [[2773 旁白 neutral]]
    Silver Killer • Holy Judgment Scars (Sacred Armament | Judgment Flames of the Discipline Priest) [[2774 旁白 neutral]]
    [A pair of revolver pistols crafted from high-purity mithril. The entire weapon has a special blessing and can load six rounds at once, with a +50% critical hit rate against dark-aligned targets. The active skill "Twelve Consecutive Purifications" consumes all ammunition to stack 12 layers of "Final Judgment" marks on the locked target (each layer reduces dark resistance by 5%).] [[2775 旁白 neutral]]
    "Every bullet in the chamber is a confession, and when the trigger is pulled, judgment descends." - Inscribed on the gun body is "Light's Canon" Chapter 4, Verse 12: "Let no darkness exist under the morning star." [[2776 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[2777 旁白 neutral]]
    After a quick scan, he looked at his strong muscles, highlighted by the pure white priest's robe. This muscular physique really didn't look like something an ordinary priest who prayed daily and spread the gospel could possess. [[2778 旁白 neutral]]
    So, the old man was definitely not a proper priest when he was alive, and the skills he taught him were far from those of a normal clergyman. Looking at this skill panel, if you didn't look at the class, you might think it was some berserker disguised as a priest, sneaking into the church. [[2779 旁白 neutral]]
    In short, as for his role as a priest, he only learned a few basic magic skills, barely enough for use. The rest of the skill slots had nothing to do with clerics or mages. After seeing all the skills, he always felt an urge to "fight, awesome!" [[2780 旁白 neutral]]
    But no matter what, even if he didn't transform into the Water Saintess form, he had completely gotten rid of the fact that he was a weakling. A Tier 3 Discipline Priest was more than enough in a small place like Kempfer. As long as nothing unexpected happened, like a beginner village boss fight, protecting the town would be a piece of cake, right? [[2781 旁白 neutral]]
    He closed the panel, took out his pocket watch, and saw that there was still some time until noon. If he went back now, the lazy Isabella would probably be very happy to push the remaining opportunities to listen to confessions onto him. [[2782 旁白 neutral]]
    It wasn't that he was unwilling to perform his duties, but Isabella was very lazy. On weekdays, she bore the title of a great nun, but she only ever wandered around and rarely fulfilled her responsibilities. [[2783 旁白 neutral]]
    So, he decided to leave this opportunity to listen to confessions entirely to her. Helping the town residents solve their problems and interpreting the teachings of the Wind God were good deeds that accumulated merit, and only he would think of her. He wondered how Isabella would thank him if she knew of his good intentions. [[2784 旁白 neutral]]
    Due to the protection and spread of faith from the Wind God, a free atmosphere permeated the various fortified cities in the Windermere territory. Compared to the territories of other Saintesses or areas controlled by the Church, taxes here were minimal, and the lives of the town residents were relatively peaceful and healthy. [[2785 旁白 neutral]]
    On weekdays, the town didn't have many trivial matters. His life as a priest was quite leisurely, apart from daily spiritual guidance, visitation services, and spiritual prayers. But once Sunday came, everything changed... [[2786 旁白 neutral]]
    Every Sunday was a day that every resident of Kempfer town marked with a red circle, because on this day, Sister Evelyn would be on duty at the church, providing the warmest care and blessings to the town residents who came to pray and confess. [[2787 旁白 neutral]]
    And Evelyn, like Andre, was a pseudonym that the old man had given him when he was alive. [[2788 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps it was because of the high charm value of Loberia in her Saintess form, or perhaps the abnormal affinity ability on her skill panel, but in short, almost no one in the entire town could refuse Loberia. [[2789 旁白 neutral]]
    Some were attracted by her appearance, and some by her holy aura, but more were conquered by the Saintess's noble personality. [[2790 旁白 neutral]]
    The name Evelyn was like a celebrity in Kempfer town. Although in terms of identity, she was just an ordinary nun who only came to work at the church on Sundays. [[2791 旁白 neutral]]
    The thought of transforming into Evelyn tomorrow and facing the almost overflowing crowd of enthusiastic town residents in the church made Andre instinctively feel a headache and want to rub his forehead. [[2792 旁白 fearful]]
    Damn it, thinking of that scene, why did it feel like a maiden idol? [[2793 旁白 surprised]]
    Wasn't he in a Western fantasy world? Why was it so full of magical girl vibes? [[2794 旁白 surprised]]
    Should he pretend to be sick tomorrow and let Evelyn rest for a day? [[2795 旁白 neutral]]
    No, no, his conscience told him he couldn't. If he really let Evelyn, whom the town residents had been looking forward to for a week, stand them up, he could even imagine the faces of everyone tomorrow filled with disappointment and dejection. [[2796 旁白 fearful]]
    The reproach of his conscience made him unable to harden his heart. Besides, even if it wasn't for the town residents, he was running low on high-grade holy water. [[2797 旁白 neutral]]
    High-grade holy water, as a sacred item strictly controlled by the Church, could only be produced by Evelyn, apart from the monthly quota distributed by the superior cathedrals... [[2798 旁白 neutral]]
    PS: Thank you all for your love for this new book. Based on some questions accumulated in the comment section these days, I will answer them here. The protagonist will definitely completely turn into a girl and won't be able to change back in the end, but this is a process. I have been writing transformation novels for several years, and my writing style has always leaned towards dual character development. The protagonist's male and female bodies are equally important, just like in Tokusatsu. If an Ultraman movie only has an Ultraman and no human host, it will feel like something important is missing. The growth of a story should be two-sided, not one-sided. [[2799 旁白 neutral]]
    Of course, I also understand that everyone who comes to read this book must like to see heroine plotlines. I will try my best to balance the frequency of male and female protagonists appearing. Those who have read my previous book know that I don't like to treat the heroine as a big move, always hiding her until the end of a volume. The interaction between the protagonist's male and female bodies will not be less on weekdays. I will try to satisfy readers who like to see both male and female body plotlines, so you don't have to worry. The quality is guaranteed, just read it with confidence. Finally, a reminder: don't stockpile chapters, don't stockpile chapters. Many good books die from being stockpiled. If you like this book, don't stockpile it! [[2800 旁白 neutral]]
