Chapter 8: Reset 8 - This is bad~ [[417 旁白 surprised]]
As it turned out, Selen An's idea was correct. [[418 旁白 neutral]]
He forced a straight face, using a calm and indifferent expression the original owner had never shown, and made a request that sounded like last words. [[419 旁白 neutral]]
Serenia's ice-blue eyes suddenly softened. She lowered her gaze slightly, ripples once again stirring in her clear blue pupils. [[420 旁白 sad]]
After a long moment, the girl's red lips parted slightly. [[421 旁白 neutral]]
"...I promise you." [[422 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
At the same time, her gaze toward the young man grew complicated. She could never understand why this childhood friend, who she had played with, had turned out this way and done such foolish things. [[423 旁白 sad]]
The innocent face of his childhood had long been drowned in the public's curses, along with the many crimes Selen An had committed as he grew up. [[424 旁白 sad]]
Judging by his crimes, Selen An deserved this fate. [[425 旁白 neutral]]
If her childhood friend had clung to her leg, crying and begging shamelessly, she might have already struck him down with her sword. [[426 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't because she was cruel, but precisely because she still cherished their pure childhood friendship that she had to kill him immediately. [[427 旁白 sad]]
For this childhood friend, whose nature had rotted to the core, death was the kindest release. His life was not only a torment to himself, but also an injustice to the innocent. [[428 旁白 sad]]
But now, he had changed. He no longer seemed like the person she remembered. His emotions, his gaze, and even his tone had shed their old absurdity and childishness. He had suddenly matured... [[429 旁白 surprised]]
Perhaps, facing death, even someone as absurd as him could understand some things in the final moments of his life. [[430 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An deserved to die, but as he said, dying as a human was a show of respect not only to himself, but to the entire Winterlein family and the Water Saintess. [[431 旁白 neutral]]
She never hesitated when facing the Demon Clan, but now, faced with the most infamous scion in all of Kelt, Serenia wavered... [[432 旁白 sad]]
For the sake of their childhood bond, her heart softened, and she agreed. [[433 旁白 sad]]
Hearing her answer, Selen An let out a huge sigh of relief. The first part of his plan had succeeded. He wouldn't have to die for now. Serenia was someone who kept her promises. Since she agreed to help him remove the Succubus Seed from his body, she would definitely find a way to do it. [[434 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how many difficulties she faced, she would do what she promised. [[435 旁白 neutral]]
But completely removing the Succubus Seed was no easy task. It would take time. In other words, through his own effort and acting, Selen An had successfully changed his immediate death sentence into a suspended one. [[436 旁白 neutral]]
As long as he could cling to Serenia's coattails during this "probation" period and return to the Empire, the Winterlein family would definitely protect him, given their influence and the fact that he was the sole heir. [[437 旁白 neutral]]
The chilling ice sword moved away from his neck. Selen An secretly sighed in relief, but his expression remained unchanged. [[438 旁白 neutral]]
This was another key point. After gaining a girl's initial favor, you must not immediately reveal your true self or make a mistake. You have to maintain the act, so she feels she made the right choice. [[439 旁白 neutral]]
Just as he was repeating these precautions in his mind, Serenia reached out again, pulling his hands forward and putting them together. [[440 旁白 neutral]]
With a light tap of her fingertips on his wrist, a pair of ice handcuffs appeared out of thin air on Selen An's previously free hands. [[441 旁白 surprised]]
This sudden development startled him, but luckily, he had expected it. He resisted the urge to twitch his lips, maintaining a calm and indifferent look. [[442 旁白 neutral]]
A person who has already accepted death should not show surprise at such a small incident. [[443 旁白 neutral]]
Serenia watched the young man's expression the whole time. Only after seeing nothing unusual did she speak. [[444 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't even think about escaping. Otherwise, you'll only die faster." [[445 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
She said coldly, then turned around, intending to pull the ice chain connected to the handcuffs and lead Selen An away. [[446 旁白 neutral]]
But at that moment, the calm wasteland ground began to tremble without warning. [[447 旁白 surprised]]
The two of them instinctively turned their heads and saw— [[448 旁白 surprised]]
A cloud of dust that blotted out the sun rose from the horizon, as if the entire wasteland was boiling. Black heavy armor reflected the crimson sunlight, and demonic war banners tore through the smoke, fluttering loudly. The roar of thousands of iron hooves trampling the earth sounded like the earth's final scream before being torn apart. [[449 旁白 fearful]]
The troll knight in the lead held a serrated longsword high, its six-legged bone lizard mount breathing out sulfurous flames. Its red scales burst open as it charged, revealing blood vessels flowing with lava underneath. [[450 旁白 fearful]]
The winged demon legion following behind stirred up a hurricane with their wings. Their horned faces were covered in eerie blue demonic patterns, and the lightning spears in their sharp claws crackled. [[451 旁白 fearful]]
The sand and gravel turned into a scarlet mist under the iron hooves. The unique stench of the Demon Clan, mixed with a wave of heat, rushed towards them. [[452 旁白 fearful]]
Selen An saw the beast-like heavy cavalry charging at the front—three-meter-tall monsters covered in bone armor, with writhing fleshy tumors on their exposed shoulders and necks. [[453 旁白 fearful]]
When they roared, the drool hanging from their fangs corroded the ground, making it sizzle and smoke. [[454 旁白 fearful]]
They're here, they're here... [[455 塞伦安 fearful]]
Damn it, why is this different from the original story? [[456 塞伦安 fearful]]
In the original plot, the demon army was supposed to surround this wasteland at dusk. Why are they so early? [[457 塞伦安 fearful]]
Wait... [[458 塞伦安 surprised]]
Mara. It was her. Because of my interference, the key plot was rewritten. Due to the butterfly effect, a panicked Mara led the demon army to surround this place ahead of schedule. [[459 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An's throat moved with difficulty, and cold sweat trickled down his back. [[460 塞伦安 fearful]]
Are you kidding me? [[461 塞伦安 fearful]]
No matter how strong Serenia was, she couldn't face so many demons at once. Besides, with such a large army, there had to be a powerful demon general in command. [[462 塞伦安 fearful]]
Facing the surging black tide, Selen An felt that he and Serenia were like two insignificant ants, about to be swallowed up in an instant. [[463 塞伦安 fearful]]
His body froze in fear, but then a sudden force pushed him away, followed by a crisp shattering sound. [[464 旁白 surprised]]
The restraints on his hands were released; the ice handcuffs were unlocked just as soon as they had been put on. [[465 旁白 surprised]]
In a daze, Selen An saw a snow-white figure blocking his path. With her long silver hair fluttering in the wind, Serenia turned, her arms still in a pushing motion, and yelled at him. [[466 旁白 surprised]]
"Go!" [[467 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
Her voice was like a stimulant injected into Selen An's body. He felt as if he was being carried by the wind, flying backward in the direction where there were no enemies. [[468 旁白 surprised]]
As he flew backward, Selen An watched the elegant figure shrink in his vision, his pupils contracting violently. [[469 旁白 surprised]]
"Serenia!" [[470 塞伦安 sad]]
He subconsciously called out her name, but the girl didn't look back. Instead, she charged toward the black tide of the demon army. [[471 旁白 sad]]
A bone-chilling aura instantly swept across the battlefield. On this desolate and barren land, the girl held her sacred sword, stepped into a domain of ice and snow, and charged into the demon formation without hesitation, sounding the first horn of battle! [[472 旁白 sad]]
Such a scene, such a choice, such an answer... [[473 旁白 sad]]
As he flew backward, Selen An didn't know why, but upon seeing all this happen, he felt a sudden, sharp pain in his heart. [[474 塞伦安 sad]]
In this sudden situation, Serenia staying behind to cover his escape was the best outcome for him, so why... why was this the first time he was experiencing this part of the story from a first-person perspective? [[475 塞伦安 sad]]
Where did this throbbing in his heart, this familiar feeling echoing in his chest, come from? [[476 塞伦安 sad]]
