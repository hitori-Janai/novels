Chapter 86: Prophecy [[4873 旁白 neutral]]
    On this day, the nuns saw the Father emerge full of joy and return full of exhaustion. Everyone was puzzled, thinking that Father Andre had been too tired these past few days and his physical condition hadn't recovered, so they considerately didn't disturb him. [[4874 旁白 neutral]]
    In Andre's room, as the man's feet stepped into the room and he casually closed the door, the strong, tense aura around him instantly deflated. He almost slumped against the wall and sat on the floor. He reached out and touched his back, his hand wet with cold sweat. [[4875 旁白 neutral]]
    "Whew, what a troublesome fairy." [[4876 安德烈 neutral]]
    The man reached out again, took off his towel, and wiped the dense, tiny beads of sweat from his forehead. [[4877 旁白 neutral]]
    Just the conversation about Evelyn earlier was full of dangers throughout. If he hadn't been so quick-witted, he might have really fallen into the trap dug by that little girl. [[4878 旁白 neutral]]
    One could only say that the Wind Saintess's lineage truly deserved to be called natural drama queens. Their faces displayed a sincere, resilient, and lovely girlish image, but in reality, every word was a test! [[4879 旁白 neutral]]
    Talking to her, even though the person in his sight was a beautiful girl with an innocent and cute face, during the conversation, he actually felt a suffocating and oppressive sensation, like being coiled by a giant python. [[4880 旁白 fearful]]
    This was simply as terrifying as a monster! [[4881 旁白 fearful]]
    Damn it! [[4882 旁白 angry]]
    As expected, none of those who could become Saintesses were easy to deal with. [[4883 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre cursed inwardly, but then he inexplicably felt something was off. [[4884 旁白 neutral]]
    In a sense, he seemed to be a Saintess too? [[4885 旁白 neutral]]
    Then it's fine, add a prerequisite: apart from the Water Saintess, none of the other Saintesses are easy to deal with! [[4886 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre made this bold assertion. [[4887 旁白 neutral]]
    So, it would be better for him to avoid the Wind Saintess these few days. But he couldn't avoid it forever. It was only two days until Sunday. If Evelyn didn't appear in the church as usual then, it would definitely arouse the suspicion of that dramatic pair of master and servant. [[4888 旁白 neutral]]
    His little trick of identity switching might be fine to use in front of the less intelligent Isabella, but he didn't believe that such a trick could deceive a high-ranking Saintess, especially one who was even more cunning than Isabella! [[4889 旁白 neutral]]
    If this character were placed in a previous life's Liaozhai-type novel, she would definitely belong to the type of seductive and deceitful vixen who told countless lies. To sum it up in one sentence, she was "extremely cunning." [[4890 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre fell into distress. He had calculated everything, but he hadn't calculated that besides himself, a Saintess, there was a Duke sealed below, and secretly another Blood Clan Duke coveted this place. Now, there was even a Wind Saintess visiting. [[4891 旁白 neutral]]
    Little Kempfer actually produced so many talents, if one were to count them, they'd be as numerous as scattered sesame seeds! [[4892 旁白 neutral]]
    So, should he appear as Evelyn then? [[4893 旁白 neutral]]
    Father Andre squatted in the bathroom, lost in thought. [[4894 旁白 neutral]]
    On the other side... [[4895 旁白 neutral]]
    Next to the town's wheat field, heavy, golden wheat swayed in the wind. The town residents were diligently working in the wheat field, while Moying, as an outsider, was walking with Isabella. Along the way, there was no shortage of friendly conversations and investigations with the farmers. [[4896 旁白 neutral]]
    "Your Royal Highness, what do you think of this inspection?" [[4897 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Didn't I tell you? Don't call me Her Royal Highness during this period. Just call me Miss." [[4898 墨莺 neutral]]
    "But we're speaking in wind language. Outsiders can't hear us." [[4899 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella was puzzled. [[4900 旁白 neutral]]
    "Call me Miss even in private, mainly because I'm afraid you'll get used to calling me Her Royal Highness in private, and then accidentally let it slip in public. That wouldn't be good." [[4901 墨莺 neutral]]
    In the eyes of outsiders, the two young ladies dressed in black and white nun robes walked leisurely through the wheat field, smiling. Against the backdrop of the golden wheat field, they were as beautiful as a painting. Their beauty was a serene kind of beauty, and there was no sound of conversation between them. [[4902 旁白 neutral]]
    This was as Isabella had said: their conversation utilized the wind language of wind magic, directly transmitting their intended meaning, along with their vocal tone, to the other party's ears via the wind, ensuring no information was lost along the way. [[4903 旁白 neutral]]
    "Isabella, you've completed the task I gave you very well." [[4904 墨莺 happy]]
    "It's my duty, Your Royal High... no, the task assigned by Miss must be completed with all my heart and soul. After this observation, I wonder what Miss thinks of that..." [[4905 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Are you referring to Father Andre?" [[4906 墨莺 neutral]]
    "Indeed, I've known him for two years. His character goes without saying. Aside from occasionally liking to look at nuns' thighs, he's absolutely reliable. He's only at the third tier now, but the night before last, facing so many ghouls and vampires, he managed to hold out for so long by himself. It's clear he has definitely inherited all the old werewolf's abilities." [[4907 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    When it came to serious matters, Isabella shed all her laziness and instantly became respectful and serious. Moying, after carefully listening to her report, also nodded in approval. [[4908 旁白 neutral]]
    Regarding the secrets of vampires, werewolves, and witches involving this town, Isabella had already learned the basic situation when she went to Jingtie City to call for reinforcements. [[4909 旁白 neutral]]
    "So, in summary, apart from some insignificant minor flaws, he is definitely the talent Miss needs." [[4910 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella's idea was very simple: apart from the Water Saintess, whose situation was the most special, her own Saintess had the shortest tenure. Due to problems left by the previous Wind Saintess, Miss's situation in the family and the Church was not ideal. Many old-timers believed that Miss's personality was too weak to bear the responsibility of a Saintess. If it weren't for Miss's absolutely pure bloodline and extraordinary talent in wind magic, whether Miss could smoothly inherit the position of Saintess would be a big problem. [[4911 旁白 neutral]]
