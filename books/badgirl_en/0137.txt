Chapter 137: Elf [[8684 旁白 neutral]]
"I thought you would kill them." [[8685 Seraphina neutral]]
Half-kneeling and tying up the last mercenary who had lost the ability to resist, Serafina stood up and looked at the captives sprawled on the ground, saying this. [[8686 旁白 neutral]]
The young man sitting on a rock carefully wiped the bloodstains from his rifle, and hearing the girl’s teasing, he curled his lips in disdain. [[8687 旁白 neutral]]
"I wouldn’t go that far with myself. Killing too many people would only dirty my sword, and besides…" [[8688 塞伦安 neutral]]
He glanced at the tied-up defeated men on the ground again, then felt his pockets, inevitably sighing. [[8689 旁白 sad]]
Don’t look at him acting like a rich young master now. When he left Kempfer, he was too rushed and only brought some key items, but not much money. After all the expenses along the way, he had very little money left in his pocket. [[8690 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems these wandering mercenaries usually stay in this area to rob travelers. Because their group is small and highly mobile, it’s not easy for the Church and the city guards to send troops to wipe them out. But there must be bounties for these people in the city. Your young master is also short on money recently, so I’ll spare these few people and exchange their lives for bounties." [[8691 塞伦安 neutral]]
With that, he finished wiping his rifle, put the weapon back into his sleeve, jumped off the rock, and walked to the sturdy man who was most tightly bound by the ropes. [[8692 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An first untied the restrictions on him, then squatted down to talk to the leader. [[8693 旁白 neutral]]
"Sir, we can say we met by fighting. My attendant and I are a priest and a nun planned to be transferred to Giant Rock City. We originally planned to take a carriage to our new posts, but our hired coachman was scared away by you..." [[8694 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I have always been very merciful, and I’m sure you must have felt my great love just now, so you don’t have to worry about your lives, except for the first one who ran into my knife. But mercy is mercy, and citizens’ financial freedom is protected by law. You scared away our hired coachman, so as compensation, you wouldn’t mind guiding us, would you?" [[8695 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An’s idea was simple. He and Serafina, two outsiders, were intercepted halfway. Although the carriage was still there, the coachman had run away. It was an unfamiliar place, and Giant Rock City was still some distance away. If they tried to find their way themselves, who knew how much time they would waste. [[8696 旁白 neutral]]
To put it bluntly, these wandering mercenaries were like bandits. They had been entrenched here for many years and could avoid the encirclement and suppression of the Church army and city guards, so they must be extremely familiar with the road conditions. It would be better to "persuade" them to lead the way and save themselves a lot of trouble. [[8697 旁白 neutral]]
"We’ll obey the Young Master! We’ll obey the Young Master!" [[8698 陌生男1 happy]]
The previous battle had completely shattered the confidence of the sturdy man. At this moment, hearing that there was still room for discussion, he immediately expressed his loyalty. [[8699 旁白 neutral]]
Although they were both third-tier, this overly delicate young priest was terrifyingly strong. He was practically an army of one, and their brothers couldn’t compare. [[8700 旁白 fearful]]
"That’s good. I’ll untie you, and you drive the carriage. I’ll sit next to you and take good care of you." [[8701 塞伦安 happy]]
The blond young man untied the sturdy man with a benevolent smile, but just as the ropes on the sturdy man’s body loosened, a fierce glint flashed in the eyes of the big man who had been full of smiles. In Selen An’s blind spot, he raised a fist as big as a sandbag and swung it towards the young man’s forehead. [[8702 旁白 angry]]
A full-strength blow from a third-tier warrior, even barehanded, would be enough to smash an ordinary adult’s head like a watermelon. [[8703 旁白 neutral]]
At the critical moment, only a melodious and ethereal voice quickly approached. [[8704 旁白 neutral]]
"Be careful!" [[8705 陌生女1 surprised]]
Along with the voice, there was an arrow piercing the air. [[8706 旁白 neutral]]
"Swish!" [[8707 旁白 neutral]]
An emerald green stream of light accurately pierced the sturdy man’s raised arm. Blood splattered, and a ferocious, painful expression appeared on the man’s face. He let out an uncontrollable, heartbreaking wail. [[8708 旁白 fearful]]
"Ahhh!" [[8709 陌生男1 fearful]]
Seraphina, who had already pulled out a dagger from under her skirt, preparing to strike, heard this unfamiliar voice and immediately looked vigilantly towards the source of the sound. [[8710 旁白 surprised]]
The cold gleam of the sword’s tip in his sleeve silently retracted. Selen An ignored the wailing sturdy man on the ground, as he had expected such a thing to happen, and looked behind him with interest. [[8711 旁白 neutral]]
Behind him, on the branch of an old tree dozens of meters away, a figure cloaked in black, holding a bow, watched from afar. [[8712 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, this mysterious person was the one who had acted righteously just now. [[8713 旁白 neutral]]
"Sir, thank you for your help. May I invite you down for a chat to express my gratitude?" [[8714 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man looked up and said loudly. [[8715 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment of silence, the black figure glanced at Serafina’s direction, then leaped down and appeared in the center of the two. [[8716 旁白 neutral]]
"No need for thanks, I just happened to be passing by." [[8717 陌生女1 neutral]]
It was still that pleasant voice, just hearing it made one feel as comfortable as if a gentle breeze were caressing their face. [[8718 旁白 happy]]
"No, no, no, how can we simply forget a life-saving grace? I am a priest about to go to Giant Rock City, and that is my attendant, a nun. Your actions were extraordinary, we..." [[8719 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Enough, no need to say more." [[8720 陌生女1 angry]]
The black-cloaked figure directly interrupted Selen An’s words, clearly not wanting to have too much interaction with him. [[8721 旁白 neutral]]
But if they didn’t want to interact, they should have left after shooting the arrow and saving him. Why did they come down to talk? [[8722 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An frowned. Just as he was about to speak again, he heard the person speak first. [[8723 旁白 neutral]]
"It’s too early to thank me now. Your crisis seems to be more complicated than just a mercenary group blocking the road." [[8724 陌生女1 neutral]]
Saying that, the black-cloaked figure pointed a hand towards Serafina’s direction. [[8725 旁白 neutral]]
"You said he is a nun accompanying you, but when did the Imperial Church start accepting bloodkins as nuns?" [[8726 陌生女1 surprised]]
At these words, Serafina’s already vigilant eyes instantly darkened. She was carrying a holy relic bestowed by Lady Celeste to conceal her aura, yet this mysterious person who appeared halfway still saw through it? [[8727 旁白 fearful]]
Given the tone in which this person exposed her identity, the newcomer was probably not to be trifled with. [[8728 旁白 fearful]]
Her mind raced, and Serafina had already subtly and silently pulled out her dagger to deal with the crisis. [[8729 旁白 fearful]]
The atmosphere seemed to become tense, but was broken by the young man’s light chuckle. [[8730 旁白 neutral]]
The black-cloaked figure looked at Selen An as if puzzled, while Selen An stopped laughing, but his emerald eyes still held a hint of amusement. [[8731 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, are you human?" [[8732 塞伦安 neutral]]
The sudden question made the mysterious person’s body stiffen. [[8733 旁白 surprised]]
"...Yes." [[8734 陌生女1 neutral]]
"But I don’t think so, because I smell a unique elf fragrance on you." [[8735 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man, with a meaningful smile, unexpectedly revealed the mysterious person’s true identity. [[8736 旁白 surprised]]
"!" [[8737 陌生女1 surprised]]
The black-cloaked figure retreated a few steps, just about to assume a defensive stance, but Selen An had already waved his hand and explained. [[8738 旁白 neutral]]
"No need to be nervous, Miss Elf. We mean no harm, we just want to clear up the misunderstanding between us." [[8739 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Don’t move! Human, otherwise I can’t guarantee my arrow won’t pierce your head next moment." [[8740 陌生女1 angry]]
But in that brief moment of speaking, the mysterious black-cloaked figure had already moved to a safe distance from Selen An, summoned a bow, and instantly drew it, aiming. [[8741 旁白 neutral]]
The elf’s voice was much colder than before, and Selen An sighed helplessly, raising his hands. [[8742 旁白 sad]]
"Don’t be so wary, Miss Elf. I said I mean you no harm. The only reason I recognized your identity is because I once visited the Elven Forest when I was young, and had a brief contact and friendship with the elves there, so I’m quite familiar with your scent." [[8743 塞伦安 neutral]]
As if to reassure the elf lady further, Selen An maintained a sincere smile on his face, adding, [[8744 旁白 neutral]]
"I know elves are very sensitive to malice, Miss Jinling. Since you were willing to help us earlier, you naturally didn’t smell any killing intent or resentment from us. Now that we are so close, you should be able to judge more clearly that I am not lying." [[8745 塞伦安 neutral]]
"..." [[8746 旁白 neutral]]
Another silence. [[8747 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, the elf lady, whose true appearance was still hidden, slowly lowered her bow, but then instantly aimed it at Seraphina. [[8748 旁白 neutral]]
"I’m willing to trust you, but only you, respected Priest. I’m also not lying, your accompanying nun is indeed a genuine bloodkin." [[8749 陌生女1 neutral]]
"I told you, this is a misunderstanding. Sera is my accompanying nun, and of course, I know she is a bloodkin." [[8750 塞伦安 neutral]]
"?" [[8751 陌生女1 surprised]]
A question mark seemed to appear above the mysterious elf lady’s head. [[8752 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Elf, you may not know, but Sera and I are clergy from Windermere. We are followers of the God of Wind. In that free land, as long as your faith is sincere, the God of Wind will accept the faith of any different race." [[8753 塞伦安 neutral]]
"So even if Sera is a bloodkin, it doesn’t prevent her from becoming a nun serving the God of Wind. After being recognized by the deity, this is her freedom." [[8754 塞伦安 neutral]]
"..." [[8755 旁白 neutral]]
The mysterious elf girl couldn’t find any flaws in these words for a moment, after all... [[8756 旁白 neutral]]
The freedom of Windermere was something even foreign elves had heard about. Priests there even dared to temporarily "borrow" silver artifacts used for sacrifices under the idol to exchange for gold lions to buy wine. [[8757 旁白 neutral]]
(PS: The common currency values in Nephelem Continent from lowest to highest are copper eagles, silver wolves, gold lions.) [[8758 旁白 neutral]]
With such a free deity and such a free land, it was not impossible to have such liberal admission criteria for clergy. [[8759 旁白 neutral]]
However, the suspicion in her heart would not be completely dispelled by a few words of explanation. After all, the reputation of bloodkins on the continent was among the worst. Few normal races would like bloodkins, just as no one would like rats hiding in sewers. [[8760 旁白 neutral]]
"If they are indeed followers of the free God of Wind, then it’s credible, but..." [[8761 陌生女1 neutral]]
Selen An heard the hesitation in the elf lady’s words and immediately added, [[8762 旁白 neutral]]
"I know that these words alone cannot completely convince you, Miss Elf. As my savior, I also have an obligation to prove to you that this is all just a misunderstanding." [[8763 塞伦安 neutral]]
Without Selen An saying more, the clever Seraphina understood. She slowly and carefully removed all her weapons and potentially dangerous items from her body, maintaining a safe distance. [[8764 旁白 neutral]]
Two specially made daggers, two miniature sleeve daggers, a special demon-sealing chain, and a small crossbow. [[8765 旁白 neutral]]
It could only be said that Seraphina had no pockets and was dressed rather lightly, yet she could carry so many weapons close to her body without any sense of incongruity. [[8766 旁白 neutral]]
To gain the complete trust of this mysterious elf lady, Seraphina even actively wrapped the demon-sealing chain around her hands, to prove that she had no intention of harming anyone. [[8767 旁白 neutral]]
Everything was ready, and Selen An signaled with his eyes. [[8768 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Elf, now you can inspect closely with peace of mind, right?" [[8769 塞伦安 neutral]]
The mysterious elf girl nodded and walked straight to Seraphina. She first looked at her hands bound by the demon-sealing chain, then spoke in a slightly apologetic tone. [[8770 陌生女1 sad]]
"Miss Sera, I apologize for the offense." [[8771 陌生女1 sad]]
"It’s fine, I’m used to being suspected anyway." [[8772 Seraphina neutral]]
The more Serafina pretended to be nonchalant, the more guilty the mysterious elf lady felt. [[8773 旁白 neutral]]
She took a deep breath, raised her left hand, and gently placed her index, middle, and ring fingers together on Serafina’s forehead, beginning the unique elf examination. [[8774 旁白 neutral]]
Due to the special nature of their souls, elves can always smell or hear scents and sounds that ordinary people cannot detect. This is what people often refer to as the elves’ keen perception, and this talent allows elves to "distinguish loyalty from treachery" to a certain extent. [[8775 旁白 neutral]]
Time passed by minute by minute, until the mysterious elf girl withdrew her hand. She bowed to Serafina, whose expression was calm, and apologized. [[8776 旁白 neutral]]
"I apologize, Miss Sera. My intuition tells me that you are a devout follower of the God of Wind. I did not smell any foul corruption on you, nor did I hear any lingering resentment from the undead. You are a true nun." [[8777 陌生女1 neutral]]
Seeing that the misunderstanding had been resolved, Selen An also walked up with a chuckle. [[8778 旁白 happy]]
"Oh, what’s there to apologize for? You are our savior, and all we did was clear up a misunderstanding. Meeting is fate. I am Andre, and she is Sera. May I know your esteemed name, Miss?" [[8779 塞伦安 happy]]
The elf lady, whose true appearance was completely hidden by her cloak, hesitated for a moment. Her gaze seemed to sweep over Selen An again, and finally, she made up her mind and directly pulled back the hood covering her head. [[8780 旁白 neutral]]
"Since Mr. Andre and Miss Sera have treated me with sincerity, I should also respond to both of you with my true appearance." [[8781 陌生女1 neutral]]
Under the sunlight, a beautiful elf with silver hair and purple eyes stood gracefully before the two. Perhaps her beauty was too striking, or perhaps elves, a race that rarely ventures out, naturally possess a certain shocking quality when they appear. Selen An even caught the sound of swallowing saliva from behind him. [[8782 旁白 surprised]]
These mercenaries really haven’t changed. They’ve been defeated and captured, yet they still have lustful thoughts. [[8783 旁白 angry]]
Selen An cursed inwardly and then refocused his attention on the silver-haired, purple-eyed elf lady. For some reason, even though her appearance was exceptionally striking, he, seeing a living elf for the first time, felt surprisingly little turbulent emotion. [[8784 旁白 neutral]]
The only feeling was a strange familiarity, as if an elder was seeing their descendant. [[8785 旁白 neutral]]
"My name is Windsor. As you can see, I am a Moon Elf who has left my homeland to wander the continent." [[8786 陌生女1 neutral]]
