Chapter 46: Prayer of Freedom [[2620 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, look who's here!" [[2621 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
As soon as he stepped through the church door, a familiar teasing voice reached his ears. [[2622 旁白 neutral]]
Following the sound, he saw a graceful figure leaning against the doorframe of the church, in a relaxed posture. [[2623 旁白 neutral]]
"It's our town's celebrity, Father Andre! Father, how was your morning run today?" [[2624 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
"Just as usual. Even what you're saying, leaning there, is no different from yesterday." [[2625 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre wiped the fine sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief, his eyelids drooping, a slightly helpless expression on his face. [[2626 旁白 neutral]]
The one talking to him was Isabella, the nun of the small town's church. He looked up and saw that Isabella, leaning against the doorframe, had long gray hair and golden-brown eyes. Even in her loose black and white nun's habit, she couldn't hide her proud figure. [[2627 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella's smile was relaxed and playful, completely lacking the piety and seriousness a head nun should have. [[2628 旁白 neutral]]
What Andre most wanted to complain about was her actions—leaning so casually against the doorframe first thing in the morning, with that kind of smile on her face. She looked less like a nun and more like those from a brothel... [[2629 旁白 neutral]]
"I feel like you're thinking some terrible things." [[2630 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
Isabella suddenly spoke up, reminding him. [[2631 旁白 neutral]]
"Cough, cough. I was actually confessing to God." [[2632 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre coughed twice and put away his impolite thoughts. [[2633 旁白 neutral]]
"Confessing what?" [[2634 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"I am sinful." [[2635 安德烈 neutral]]
As he said this, he subtly glanced at Isabella's plump, fair legs, faintly visible under her loose nun's habit. [[2636 旁白 neutral]]
Oh, damn it, those really weren't the kind of tempting legs a nun should have. [[2637 旁白 neutral]]
"But I feel like you're lying." [[2638 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella curved her lips, persistent. [[2639 旁白 neutral]]
"I admit it, but please believe me, it was absolutely a white lie." [[2640 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre raised an eyebrow, and as he spoke, walked to the center of the church. Although the small town of Kempfa was pitifully small, as the only legitimate church in the town, it still housed a corresponding statue of a god inside. [[2641 旁白 neutral]]
He habitually reached towards the silver candelabra, where there was a small bundle of his specially made incense sticks. A uniquely shaped incense burner sat in the center of the pair of silver candelabra. [[2642 旁白 neutral]]
Andre skillfully drew out three incense sticks, held one end over the outer flame of a candle to light it, then twirled them between his fingers. He looked up at the simply carved statue of the god, bowed three times, and then placed them into the incense burner. [[2643 旁白 neutral]]
After doing all this, he lowered his head and touched his forehead and both inner shoulders three times in a row, adding a devout whisper. [[2644 旁白 neutral]]
"Amen~" [[2645 安德烈 neutral]]
"To be honest, even after two years, I'm still not used to this prayer ritual. So where exactly did you learn all these strange procedures?" [[2646 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
At some point, Isabella had also come up behind him, looking at the extra set of special ritual tools on the altar table, and asked with a smile. [[2647 旁白 neutral]]
"Everything always needs innovation. As long as our faith in God is sincere, God will not blame us." [[2648 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre pushed up his glasses on the bridge of his nose with his middle finger, talking nonsense with a serious expression. [[2649 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes, yes, yes, you're right about everything. After all, you're the only priest in this church, who could possibly refute you?" [[2650 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
Isabella shrugged, not caring at all. Such an act of unilaterally changing a divine prayer ritual would definitely be a big deal in churches in other Saintess territories. In serious cases, it could even lead to accusations of blasphemy. But this was Windermere Territory, a land protected by the God of Wind. [[2651 旁白 neutral]]
As everyone knew, the God of Wind symbolized wisdom and freedom, so followers who believed in Him were naturally very free. [[2652 旁白 neutral]]
As long as your faith was devout and you respected the freedom of others, the God of Wind was happy to see all kinds of free actions from His followers. [[2653 旁白 neutral]]
Just like Andre's free ritual, just like Isabella's free posture, leaning against the church entrance as a nun... [[2654 旁白 neutral]]
The God of Wind and His followers are free. This statement might be too absolute elsewhere, but at least the two clergy members in the small town of Kempfa thoroughly upheld this point. [[2655 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll leave the church matters to you this morning. I have something I need to take care of." [[2656 安德烈 neutral]]
After finishing his daily prayer to God, Andre washed his hands with holy water from a copper basin. [[2657 旁白 neutral]]
"No, no, the church can't lose you today." [[2658 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"I remember this. I reported it in advance. You're more familiar with church matters than I am, so leaving them to you should be fine." [[2659 安德烈 neutral]]
"Under normal circumstances, that would be true, but today is a special situation." [[2660 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
As Isabella spoke, she pulled out six white slips of paper from somewhere. The slips recorded times and names, and at the end of each was the word "confession." [[2661 旁白 neutral]]
"While you were still on your morning run, six confession slips appeared at the church. They're all familiar residents from the town, so you'll most likely be spending your morning with them in the confession booth." [[2662 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"But my afternoon is already fully booked, so in that case..." [[2663 安德烈 sad]]
Andre looked at the six confession slips in Isabella's hand and couldn't help but frown in difficulty. [[2664 旁白 neutral]]
Listening to the confessions of God's followers, answering their doubts, and spreading the gospel were all duties of a priest. Normally, he wouldn't hesitate for a moment, but today... [[2665 旁白 neutral]]
If this really wouldn't work, then it would have to be in the evening... [[2666 旁白 neutral]]
"Today is the old priest's death anniversary, isn't it?" [[2667 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella suddenly interjected. [[2668 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes, I was originally planning to go to the church cemetery to pay my respects to him." [[2669 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre nodded. [[2670 旁白 neutral]]
"Then go. Remember to offer a bouquet of flowers for me too." [[2671 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"But the church matters..." [[2672 安德烈 neutral]]
"Leave it to me with peace of mind. I'll welcome the residents for you. After all, listening to the confessions of the faithful and washing away the darkness in their hearts is also a nun's duty." [[2673 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella shook the six confession slips in her hand, her voice clear and pleasant to the ear. [[2674 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you for your help, Isabella. May the wind carve your path." [[2675 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre placed one hand over his chest, genuinely blessing and praising her. [[2676 旁白 neutral]]
"May the wind carve your path... Oh, but speaking of which, if Sister Evelyn were here at the church today, there wouldn't be all this trouble. She could perfectly solve your current predicament, and the town's residents would probably be very happy for her to take over your work." [[2677 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella propped her chin on one hand, complaining somewhat lazily. [[2678 旁白 neutral]]
"But Evelyn is only free to come to the church on Sundays. Today is Saturday; tomorrow is Sunday." [[2679 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre answered with a straight face, expressionless. [[2680 旁白 neutral]]
"That's true. Sister Evelyn is not only beautiful and kind-hearted, but her smile also heals everyone's heart like an angel. No one in town dislikes her, and I feel that even outside the town, it would be hard for anyone in this world not to be charmed by Miss Evelyn, right?" [[2681 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
"Cough, cough, that's enough. Don't always be so interested in your colleagues' privacy. If you put this much effort into your work, you wouldn't be so lazy all day." [[2682 安德烈 neutral]]
Seeing Isabella grow more animated, Andre could only cough to stop her. [[2683 旁白 neutral]]
"Andre, you're really a strange person. I remember every time Miss Evelyn is mentioned, you always put on a serious expression. Could it be..." [[2684 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella seemed to realize something. She suddenly leaned closer, a sly smile in her eyes. [[2685 旁白 neutral]]
"You like Miss Evelyn too, don't you?" [[2686 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
"..." [[2687 安德烈 neutral]]
"Why aren't you saying anything?" [[2688 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"This is slander, blatant slander." [[2689 安德烈 angry]]
Andre gave her a glare, sighing deeply in his heart. [[2690 旁白 neutral]]
It was indeed slander. Everyone in this world could like Evelyn, but he was the only one who didn't believe it. After all, this secret... only he and Evelyn knew. [[2691 旁白 neutral]]
