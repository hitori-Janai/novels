Chapter 93: An Unexpected Turn [[5256 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't overthink it. When I said I could solve it, I didn't mean I was a werewolf." [[5257 安德烈 neutral]]
"Isabella, have you forgotten? Evelyn once said that there are strange things happening in this town. For example, John's eldest son's broken bone healed by itself in just three days. This isn't an isolated case in Kempfa Town; many people seem to have such special abilities." [[5258 安德烈 neutral]]
"Based on my accidental investigation, people with this ability often become very energetic during the full moon, and their wounds heal faster. Which race's characteristics do you think such an ability resembles more?" [[5259 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre once again played the role of a famous detective Conan in another world, slowly revealing a corner of the secret to Isabella. [[5260 旁白 neutral]]
The gray-haired nun was stunned. [[5261 旁白 surprised]]
"Is it...werewolves?" [[5262 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"Yes, if I'm not mistaken, the descendants left by the Wolf King back then were not few. Not only the old man, but many people in this town also possess werewolf bloodline. However, this bloodline has gradually thinned over time and through generations of intermarriage with humans, so they cannot show obvious werewolf traits, only retaining some basic passive racial abilities." [[5263 安德烈 neutral]]
As he spoke, the man took out a small glass bottle from his pocket, and inside the glass bottle was dark red blood. [[5264 旁白 neutral]]
"The werewolf bloodline already has blood." [[5265 安德烈 neutral]]
"What good person collects other people's blood for no reason?!" [[5266 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
Isabella really felt like she couldn't follow this man's way of thinking. Collecting other people's blood for no reason is usually something only cultists who hide in the shadows and like to perform curses and sacrifices do. [[5267 旁白 neutral]]
"After Evelyn told me about this, I became suspicious. So, I used the excuse of checking their health and legitimately collected some blood from people suspected of having werewolf bloodline. Just a drop, as long as this bottle of blood is dripped into the pool, whether it's true or not can be proven." [[5268 安德烈 neutral]]
... [[5269 旁白 neutral]]
The air fell into a strange silence once again. Isabella twitched, her mouth full of disbelief. That expression seemed to convey a feeling of "how could you guess to this extent" disbelief. [[5270 旁白 neutral]]
Mo Ying looked at the man's figure, and a strange light flashed in her eyes. Even the usually quiet Serafina took a second look at Andre. [[5271 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Andre, although Isabella mentioned your strong logical reasoning ability in her letter to the Saintess, I am still very shocked after seeing it with my own eyes." [[5272 墨莺 surprised]]
"If you don't become a priest, you will definitely become a famous detective!" [[5273 墨莺 happy]]
The girl clenched her fists, her tone confident. [[5274 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh, Isabella also said the same thing, but I'm not suited to be a detective. Perhaps I do have the ability to become an excellent detective, but there has only been one path before me from the beginning." [[5275 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre doesn't like to constantly talk about atonement all day long, because in his opinion, atonement is a very serious and heavy matter. Repeatedly mentioning it, on the contrary, is a kind of contempt for atonement, or merely treating it as an expendable excuse, or even a game... [[5276 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, Mr. Andre, after this matter is over, I hope to have more opportunities to talk with you." [[5277 墨莺 neutral]]
"That would be my honor." [[5278 安德烈 neutral]]
After the simple conversation ended, the matter finally entered the most crucial moment. Andre and Serafina stood on opposite sides of the pool, both holding a small glass bottle containing blood. The black-haired nun was covering her wrist with gauze on one hand; the blood seemed to have been freshly taken. [[5279 旁白 neutral]]
When the corks were opened, the bottles in their hands tilted slightly, and two drops of blood, containing different properties, dripped into the pool. Instantly, like two drops of red pigment dispersing into clear water, large ripples of violent vibrations appeared on the calm surface of the water. [[5280 旁白 neutral]]
Crimson magical energy began to surge at the bottom of the still water, and the stone slabs on the ground emitted a heavy rumble. The sudden tremor made all four people present feel a little unsteady. [[5281 旁白 fearful]]
Andre was quick to react. His gun-sword from his sleeve plunged straight into the ground, and he quickly bent down, grabbing the hilt with both hands to stabilize his body. [[5282 旁白 neutral]]
Mo Ying floated in mid-air the moment the tremor appeared, lifting the other two nuns with currents of air, her eyes fixed on the pool. [[5283 旁白 neutral]]
Terrifying magical energy unleashed a strong wind, messing up hair. Andre barely kept his eyes open, only to see two metal-like coffins breaking through the water from the dark depths, fully revealing themselves before everyone. [[5284 旁白 fearful]]
The tremor stopped. Everyone looked at the two coffins that had appeared, maintaining a tacit silence. [[5285 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems my guess was correct. Some residents in this town are indeed descendants of werewolves." [[5286 安德烈 neutral]]
"Since everything is going smoothly, let's proceed to the second step." [[5287 墨莺 neutral]]
As Mo Ying's voice fell, Serafina's figure quickly merged into the darkness, appearing behind everyone. An ethereal chant echoed, silver spatial runes rose from her palms, and on the ground, silver magical energy gradually formed the outline of a matrix. [[5288 旁白 neutral]]
The wind blew again, but this time it no longer contained the power of free flight. Instead, it bound itself around the coffins like iron rings, and patterns of cyan chains appeared between the wind rings. [[5289 旁白 neutral]]
[Wind • Sealing Art • Discipline Wind Ring] [[5290 旁白 neutral]]
The girl's pupils were instantly filled with cyan light. She spread her arms, her body suspended in mid-air, letting the wind caress her entire body. In places invisible to the naked eye, countless wind spirits lingered around her, and her small frame instantly burst forth with an undeniable powerful force. [[5291 旁白 neutral]]
Andre squinted slightly. This was not only because the magic released by the girl contained the same discipline power as her direct skills, but more so because of the wind around her. Within the pure elements, there was an ancient divine radiance that could not be concealed. [[5292 旁白 neutral]]
As Andre, who also had the identity of a Saintess, knew clearly, this was a unique mark of a Saintess. When a Saintess used magic, this divine glow would be attached, and in the game text description, it was called a Saintess possessing unique magic effects. [[5293 旁白 neutral]]
This effect cannot be actively concealed, and imitating it is extremely difficult. After all, it involves divine power, and apart from Saintesses, it is a level that only those at the peak of the sixth rank and seventh rank are qualified to touch, and Saintesses are that special kind of existence. [[5294 旁白 neutral]]
"Now!" [[5295 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
Isabella picked up the cross spear in her hand and directly lifted one of the floating coffins from the pool. Powerful wind lifted the heavy coffin, and it was about to be sent into the spatial matrix, but at this moment... [[5296 旁白 neutral]]
A sudden change occurred! [[5297 旁白 surprised]]
A sudden anomaly emerged  [[5298 旁白 neutral]]
