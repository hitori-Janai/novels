Chapter 112: Meeting Again [[6587 旁白 neutral]]
But Shabella is already dead... [[6588 旁白 sad]]
She witnessed it herself: the once holy and gentle figure fell from the heavens. The Merfolk Empress, once so powerful she made her gasp for breath, the first Water Saintess appointed by the Church, fell like a thin piece of paper. [[6589 旁白 fearful]]
Everything, absolutely everything, was because of "Burial Abyss." Some also call it "Dirty Eye," meaning the most defiled spring in the world. Just as light must have darkness, the gods created the world, created life, and gave living beings wisdom, righteousness, kindness, and many other virtues. In contrast, original sin quietly came into being. [[6590 旁白 neutral]]
Where there is purity and beauty, there must be filth and ugliness. The appearance of the Burial Abyss once caused the new world, which had just gotten on track, to "collapse midway." Fortunately, the creator gods intervened in time. Under the interwoven blockade of divine power and authority, this negative energy, completely opposite to the world's positive forces, was thoroughly compressed into a corner of the world. [[6591 旁白 neutral]]
They thought all problems were over, but unexpectedly, after only a thousand years, the negative energy in the sealed corner increased, eventually forming the Burial Abyss. It fully erupted not long after the end of the mythical era. [[6592 旁白 fearful]]
On that day, living beings were massacred. Strange black mist completely obscured the once blue sky. Surging black tides swallowed the land and polluted the oceans. Weak beings were instantly devoured upon contact with these forces. Stronger beings struggled in pain and distortion... [[6593 旁白 fearful]]
The intelligent races felt a doomsday-like crisis and prayed to the gods they believed in, begging for divine miracles to stop this world-ending disaster. [[6594 旁白 fearful]]
But the mythical era had just ended, and the true gods were restricted by rules and could not descend immediately. In a short time, the gods could only project their power from the divine realm to the mortal realm as much as possible. Those clusters of widespread miracles provided temporary refuge for living beings. [[6595 旁白 neutral]]
But the real problem was still unsolved. The Burial Abyss continued to erupt chaotic, defiled power. If it wasn't stopped, even if humans and other races could survive under the gods' protection, they would forever lose their homes they depended on. [[6596 旁白 fearful]]
But how could it be stopped? [[6597 旁白 neutral]]
Could a disaster that even the gods were helpless against in a short time truly be intervened in by mortals? [[6598 旁白 neutral]]
Among billions of living beings, there were many wise sages and many ruling monarchs, but no one spoke. At this moment, the empress of the ocean, who had fallen in love with a human and was appointed by the Church, stepped forward. Her merfolk appearance and personality made people wonder why she was the first to step forward. [[6599 旁白 surprised]]
But the doubts remained only in their hearts. If someone was the first to step forward as a guinea pig, no one would object. The foolish remained silent, and the smart ones watched with cold eyes. [[6600 旁白 neutral]]
The noble Merfolk Empress did not explain. She simply walked quietly out of the gods' sanctuary alone, facing the rampant defilement. She looked back, her cerulean, watery eyes showing no sarcasm or resentment, only a faint attachment to this world. [[6601 旁白 sad]]
"You will not die, because I am here." [[6602 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
Pure water flowed in her hands, washing out the blunt holy sword. The Empress held the sword, pointing directly at the root of the chaos. [[6603 旁白 neutral]]
"I fight for peace, and I fight for life." [[6604 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
Her fair palm brushed the blunt, unsharpened sword. Scales that even powerful magic could not easily crack shattered, and fine wounds dripped golden blood. [[6605 旁白 fearful]]
She gently inserted the holy sword, stained with golden blood, into the defiled scorched earth. Her fingertips, corroded by the black tide, caressed the golden and white sword body. When the divine runes on the holy sword lit up with golden blood, the entire trembling earth suddenly echoed with the sound of tides. [[6606 旁白 neutral]]
"Peace is never a gift easily obtained." [[6607 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"Someone always has to plant their spine into the gates of hell, to hold the floodgates for the living world!" [[6608 莎蓓拉 angry]]
Countless tiny streams of water gathered from all directions, forming a counter-clockwise swirling vortex of purified water beneath her skirt. The black tide, upon touching the edge of the vortex, let out a shriek like a baby sobbing. [[6609 旁白 fearful]]
"Today, I will use my body as a gate..." [[6610 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
She looked back one last time at the terrified faces in the sanctuary of miracles. Her merfolk ear fins spread like lilies under the moon in the strong wind. [[6611 旁白 neutral]]
"To cut off the dirtiest river in this world." [[6612 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
... [[6613 旁白 neutral]]
... [[6614 旁白 neutral]]
Cayetano remembered everything from that day clearly. [[6615 旁白 neutral]]
The final Burial Abyss was blocked by the combined efforts of Shabella and the Water God. [[6616 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, the Water God, restricted by rules and unable to descend, finally acted. She was the first god to act, and the last. Shabella, before her death, almost merged with the Water God. [[6617 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't know what the Empress felt at the end of her life; perhaps it was painful, perhaps regretful, but she would never regret it. [[6618 旁白 neutral]]
Because she knew that the stubborn merfolk girl had never betrayed her faith from beginning to end. [[6619 旁白 neutral]]
She died with a bang, but she died nonetheless. She didn't live to see her own salvation, but her promise never ended... [[6620 旁白 sad]]
Cayetano could hardly believe that a thousand years later, she would still hear the name Shabella from someone else's mouth. [[6621 旁白 surprised]]
Amidst her excitement, she also felt absurd. Death is death; even gods fall. Besides, Shabella was only a seventh-tier demigod at her strongest. How could she, a thousand years after her death, cross the distance of time to give her descendant such a "rebellious" name? [[6622 旁白 neutral]]
But as the young girl before her said, the Water Saintess never lied. [[6623 旁白 neutral]]
It had been so ever since Shabella made her vow. [[6624 旁白 neutral]]
"Where is she?" [[6625 卡耶塔娜 sad]]
Cayetano didn't even notice her voice was choked with emotion. She just grabbed the girl's hands as if possessed, asking with a hoarse voice. [[6626 卡耶塔娜 sad]]
"..." [[6627 旁白 neutral]]
"Answer my question! Where is she?!" [[6628 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
The vampire girl's emotions were beyond extreme. Her already weak body trembled even more violently now. She tightly gripped the girl's hands, and in her choked voice, there was even a faint, hard-to-detect plea. [[6629 卡耶塔娜 sad]]
"She promised... promised me..." [[6630 卡耶塔娜 sad]]
Finally, Lobelia made a move. He looked at Cayetano, who was like a broken, helpless girl before him. With one hand, he gently took her fair wrist and moved it to his chest, gently pressing her hand against his heart. [[6631 旁白 neutral]]
"Close your eyes, she is here, she has always been here." [[6632 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Ding~" [[6633 旁白 neutral]]
Like the clear chirping of a spring entering a lake, the external scene blurred, and stars shifted. The surroundings were no longer a quiet body of water, but Cayetano was suddenly pulled into that holy grand cathedral. [[6634 旁白 surprised]]
The cherry-haired girl stood blankly in the center of the pews, but when she clearly saw what was before her, her blood-red pupils sharply contracted. Because beneath the benevolent, sacred six-winged Water God statue, there was a graceful figure she could never forget. [[6635 旁白 surprised]]
The blue-haired merfolk girl, who had been praying with her hands lowered, put them down, turned, and smiled gently at her. [[6636 旁白 happy]]
"Cassandra, long time no see. How does it feel to meet again?" [[6637 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"..." [[6638 旁白 neutral]]
Responding to this soft greeting were Cassandra's silent tears streaming down her face. [[6639 旁白 sad]]
