Chapter 16: Reset 16 - Pregnancy [[985 旁白 neutral]]
"Creaaak~" [[986 旁白 neutral]]
The old wooden door was pushed open, making a familiar, tired sound. [[987 旁白 neutral]]
The sound pulled Selen An's mind back to reality. Everything he had just heard and seen, which felt so real, disappeared in an instant like smoke. [[988 旁白 neutral]]
He watched the back of the girl who pushed open the door and entered the hut. Then he looked down, staring blankly at his sweaty palm. The faint, sharp pain in his mind hadn't completely gone away, along with those last words... [[989 旁白 sad]]
"This is what I owe you." [[990 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
Why, why did that scene feel so familiar? [[991 塞伦安 surprised]]
Heat and moisture spread in his palm. He stared, confused, at the wet drop that had landed there. He instinctively touched his cheek and felt a long, wet tear stain. [[992 旁白 sad]]
I... cried? [[993 塞伦安 surprised]]
He found it utterly absurd. He was from another world. If he hadn't been transported here, everything that happened in this world would just be an interesting but unimportant game plot to him. [[994 塞伦安 angry]]
True, Serenia's last scene in the vision was very moving. Even after being dragged down by "himself," his useless childhood friend, she still gave him the hope of survival, along with those final silent words. [[995 塞伦安 sad]]
Even a cold-hearted person would be moved to tears. But that was Selen An, not me. I might be touched, but I would never cry over it! [[996 塞伦安 angry]]
I've only been in this world for a day, but I'm already feeling the same things as this body, relating to these visions. Am I starting to take on Selen An's identity? [[997 塞伦安 fearful]]
How ridiculous. But the feeling growing in his chest was so real, and together with the tear on his palm, it completely confused his thoughts. [[998 塞伦安 fearful]]
The guilt and emotions from Selen An's identity were controlling him, greatly influencing his actions. This went completely against his original goal of just surviving. [[999 塞伦安 fearful]]
He was starting to lose his sense of self. The original owner's memories were seeping into his mind, trying to slowly turn him into a different person. [[1000 塞伦安 fearful]]
That's an unacceptable thought, isn't it? [[1001 塞伦安 fearful]]
He was just a person from another world living in Selen An's body. He only wanted to survive this disaster of a plot. He couldn't worry about anyone else. He was just an ordinary, powerless person who could only look out for himself. [[1002 塞伦安 sad]]
He was just an ordinary person; he didn't want to be a hero. [[1003 塞伦安 sad]]
"Is there something wrong with me?" [[1004 塞伦安 fearful]]
He didn't understand, and he couldn't. [[1005 旁白 neutral]]
First, a surprised, cautious shout came from inside the hut. It sounded like it was from Anna. Then, Serenia's uniquely cool and clear voice was heard. The tense mood inside seemed to be soothed, and their conversation became calm. [[1006 旁白 neutral]]
Standing outside the door, Selen An caught a few muffled words carried by the wind. He picked out keywords like "danger" and "evacuate," and guessed that Serenia was explaining the situation to the mother and daughter so they could prepare to leave quickly. [[1007 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An wasn't worried about whether Anna and her mother would doubt Serenia. His childhood friend was a real Saintess. Besides her incredible fighting skills, almost every Saintess had a special, holy presence that made people respect and trust them. [[1008 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, he decided not to get involved. He would just wait for Serenia to convince the mother and daughter, and then they would leave this dangerous place tonight once everything was ready. [[1009 旁白 neutral]]
As for the future, he still had over a dozen gold coins that Anna's mother wouldn't accept. This was more than enough money for a family of three to live on for over a year. [[1010 旁白 neutral]]
With this money to start, he could live under a new name. Using his knowledge of the game's plot, he could find the right opportunities and become a wealthy merchant. That shouldn't be a problem. [[1011 旁白 neutral]]
And as for Anna and her mother, who had suffered because of him, Serenia knew their story and would definitely make sure they were taken care of. Once he had money, he could secretly help them financially to make up for the original Selen An's past mistakes. [[1012 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed like things were starting to look up, until... [[1013 旁白 neutral]]
A sharp groan broke the silence of the desolate night. [[1014 旁白 surprised]]
The sound was incredibly weak, yet so familiar. Selen An, who had been standing outside in the night breeze, whipped his head toward the hut and rushed inside without a second thought. [[1015 旁白 surprised]]
The hut was dark, but light soon pushed the darkness away. The silver-haired girl lit an ice-blue flame in her hand. Selen An used the light to look toward the source of the sound. On the simple wooden bed, an anxious Anna stood. The woman on the bed was covered in sweat, her swollen body twisting in pain. [[1016 旁白 fearful]]
"Ma'am!" [[1017 塞伦安 fearful]]
"Mother, what's wrong? Mother!" [[1018 安娜 fearful]]
Anna asked anxiously. [[1019 旁白 neutral]]
"My stomach... the baby!" [[1020 母亲 fearful]]
"She's going into labor." [[1021 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Serenia suddenly spoke. Following her gaze, Selen An saw a startling patch of blood on the old blanket beneath the woman's lower body. [[1022 旁白 surprised]]
Her water broke! [[1023 塞伦安 surprised]]
Even with his limited knowledge of biology, the moment Selen An saw the blood, he understood the situation. [[1024 旁白 surprised]]
At this critical moment, just as they were about to retreat, Anna's mother was having her baby! [[1025 旁白 surprised]]
Looking at the woman on the bed, sweating and in pain from the contractions, Selen An remembered her kind face from their conversation during the day, and his heart felt heavy. [[1026 旁白 sad]]
"What... what do we do? Is she going to give birth here?" [[1027 塞伦安 fearful]]
He instinctively looked around. There was no doctor, no modern medical equipment, not even a basin of hot water. In these conditions, could Anna's mother really deliver her baby successfully? [[1028 旁白 fearful]]
Thinking this, he looked at Anna by the bed. The girl, who had seemed so mature and distant during the day, now had a face full of panic. Watching her mother groan in pain, she didn't know what to do. [[1029 旁白 fearful]]
It seemed Anna didn't know how to deliver a baby either. It made sense. No matter how mature Anna was, she was still a young girl. How could she know how to deliver a baby when she had never been a mother herself? [[1030 旁白 sad]]
The environment was terrible, the conditions were poor, and there was no one to help with the delivery. The woman's already weak body couldn't take much more. Just as they were at a complete loss, the girl beside him thrust a lit torch into his hands and walked over to the bed. [[1031 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll do it." [[1032 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Hearing this, Anna's eyes filled with hope, but her face quickly showed worry. [[1033 旁白 neutral]]
"But, Your Highness, how could we let you do something like this..." [[1034 安娜 fearful]]
The body of a Saintess was pure and sacred. Before her family's tragedy, when she lived in the city, she had seen the Saintess who led the holy rites. After her ritual bath, the Saintess would walk on red carpets scattered with flower petals by countless clerics. [[1035 旁白 neutral]]
In people's eyes, a Saintess was spotless, noble, and divine. How could one ever do something as bloody and messy as delivering a baby? [[1036 旁白 surprised]]
"A life is at stake." [[1037 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
She didn't explain further. Those four simple words made Anna swallow all her worries. The look in her eyes now held a deep, heartfelt admiration. [[1038 旁白 happy]]
This was a Saintess, a true Saintess. She had the blood of the gods but did not act high and mighty, showing compassion equally to everyone. [[1039 旁白 happy]]
With no tools, she made them. The power of ice formed into ice-scissors and an ice-basin in the girl's hands. She told Anna to help her mother spread her legs to make the delivery easier, then turned to Selen An, who stood by, worried but helpless. [[1040 旁白 neutral]]
"You stand guard outside the door. Report immediately if you see anything strange!" [[1041 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Their eyes met for a moment. Through her eyes, Selen An felt a flicker of the same emotion from his memories when he was unconscious. Without hesitation, he nodded with a serious expression. [[1042 旁白 neutral]]
"Okay." [[1043 塞伦安 neutral]]
