Chapter 129: Post-War Summary [[7876 旁白 neutral]]
The black curtain obscuring the sky was torn apart by free will. When the first ray of dawn scattered upon people's faces, it signaled that the evil god's disaster, which instantly swept across the entire Windermere Territory, was swiftly quelled. [[7877 旁白 neutral]]
Cain successfully descended, at least His consciousness successfully descended to the mortal realm. Yet, He did not fully descend, because before He could draw enough vitality from the earth to construct His divine body, His very existence was already dispersed by a thousand winds. [[7878 旁白 neutral]]
Her toes touched the ground, the maiden's posture still a bit shaky, but a pair of hands promptly and thoughtfully supported her from behind. Lobelia turned her head and saw the free bard smiling at her, revealing a set of white teeth. [[7879 旁白 neutral]]
That expression seemed to have "How about it? I'm reliable, right?" written all over his face, making Lobelia feel like she was about to laugh from annoyance. [[7880 旁白 neutral]]
However, speaking of which, the free Wind God did do something proper this time. In matters of great importance, this God of Wisdom indeed possessed great wisdom and was never vague. [[7881 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you." [[7882 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Eh~ thanking me for this would be too distant. Between us, who's who?" [[7883 马修 neutral]]
"Matthew" still held his worn-out harp, constantly leaning towards the maiden. Lobelia subconsciously distanced herself, politely declining. [[7884 旁白 neutral]]
"I do know Mr. Matthew, but this is my first time meeting the esteemed Lord Wind God. I dare not overstep my bounds." [[7885 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The maiden's voice was clear and calm, causing the joyful expression on Matthew's face to fade slightly. He sighed, nodding as if a little helpless. [[7886 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, in that case, I won't force you." [[7887 马修 neutral]]
"However..." [[7888 马修 neutral]]
He changed the subject, and the slight regret in his eyes instantly vanished, replaced by a cunning squint. [[7889 旁白 neutral]]
"As the contemporary Water Saintess, the human agent of the Water God, I, an incarnation of the Wind God, want you to convey a few words to the Water God for me. Is that alright?" [[7890 马修 neutral]]
"But the Water God has already fallen asleep and has not yet awakened." [[7891 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia frowned. [[7892 旁白 neutral]]
"It doesn't matter. When She awakens, you can tell Her then." [[7893 马修 neutral]]
With things put this way, Lobelia had no reason to refuse and could only nod. [[7894 旁白 neutral]]
"Please help me convey to Her, say... you've done enough. If you're tired, then stop." [[7895 马修 sad]]
"..." [[7896 旁白 neutral]]
A gentle breeze stirred the fallen leaves on the ground, creating a rustling sound. After a long moment, the maiden nodded. [[7897 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, if there's a chance, I will convey that message." [[7898 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"That would be for the best." [[7899 马修 happy]]
"Matthew" seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, revealing a contented smile, and turned to leave. [[7900 旁白 neutral]]
"Wait, are you just going to leave like that?" [[7901 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The bard's steps paused at the maiden's question. He seemed to suddenly remember something and smacked his head. [[7902 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah, right, I can't just leave like this. But next is the daily 'drunk' time. Tsk, what a headache. Otherwise..." [[7903 马修 neutral]]
"I'll leave my girl to you. A benevolent Saintess wouldn't refuse this small request of mine, right?" [[7904 马修 happy]]
"I..." [[7905 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Before Lobelia could respond to this utterly unreliable request, the bard's figure had already transformed into wisps of azure wind and vanished from the spot. [[7906 旁白 neutral]]
Gazing at the spot where "Matthew" disappeared, Lobelia felt a deep sense of powerlessness, wanting to cover her face for the first time. [[7907 旁白 fearful]]
One could only say that this unrestrained and freedom-loving personality truly befitted the Wind God. [[7908 旁白 neutral]]
The free song still lingered in her ears. Looking around, the residual black mist in the sky had been completely purified by the power of the wind. With wings behind her and emerald light shimmering around her, the singing maiden appeared immensely divine and sacred at this moment. [[7909 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm, she looks somewhat like a Saintess now." [[7910 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia habitually commented in her mind with the tone of a senior. [[7911 旁白 neutral]]
"Evelyn..." [[7912 梅黛亚 neutral]]
A call pulled her consciousness back. Turning her head, she saw Medea cautiously approaching from the side, her expression somewhat worried and complex. [[7913 旁白 neutral]]
The battle had ended. Her fiery red hair had lost its vibrant vitality, returning to an aged grey. Her tender skin withered visibly, and the youth on her body was rapidly fading. [[7914 旁白 sad]]
"Grandma Medea, I'm here." [[7915 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The blue-haired maiden stood gracefully, her hands clasped over her lower abdomen, her luxurious skirt swaying slightly in the wind. [[7916 旁白 neutral]]
Medea's eyes reflected the maiden's changed demeanor, and for a moment, her hesitation deepened. [[7917 旁白 sad]]
After witnessing the power the maiden had just unleashed, she had some guesses in her heart. Previously, she had treated Evelyn as a junior like her granddaughter, but now, the fledgling had clearly shown strength beyond her own. Would a full-fledged bird still need her, a "grandma" with no blood relation? [[7918 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps hearing Lobelia call out "Grandma Medea" in her usual affectionate way, she subconsciously raised her hand to gently stroke the other's head. However, the divinity the maiden had previously displayed flashed through her mind, and her raised hand froze in mid-air, hesitating, unsure what to do. [[7919 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps sensing the hesitation in Medea's eyes, Lobelia did not hesitate at all. She stepped forward to stand before the grandmother she respected from the bottom of her heart, bent down, and actively placed her head against the other's half-raised palm, rubbing slightly. [[7920 旁白 neutral]]
"No matter how my identity changes, you will always be my Grandma Medea. At least this much will never change. This is my promise." [[7921 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
The familiar touch and warmth were revisited through the contact. Medea paused slightly, and the last trace of hesitation in her eyes completely dissipated, replaced by genuine tenderness. [[7922 旁白 happy]]
"Good, my good Evelyn." [[7923 梅黛亚 happy]]
However, this heartwarming scene between grandmother and granddaughter did not last long, as another voice drifted into their ears. [[7924 旁白 neutral]]
"Is... Evelyn, Priestess, where is our young lady?" [[7925 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Dragging a half-injured arm, her grey hair tied into a ponytail, Isabella, who had survived in the cellar, had arrived above ground at some point. [[7926 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because of the singing, the grey-haired nun looked up and saw Celeste, who was finishing her holy song, and her golden-brown eyes immediately brightened. [[7927 旁白 neutral]]
"The young lady is fine!" [[7928 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
After confirming the most important matter in her heart, Isabella, whose body was already weak, let out the breath she was holding, and her legs stumbled, about to collapse on the spot. Fortunately, Lobelia swiftly appeared behind her and supported her from behind. [[7929 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry." [[7930 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
The blue-haired maiden lowered her gaze slightly, her tone somewhat ashamed. [[7931 旁白 sad]]
When she activated her authority, she mobilized almost all her power, which caused the clone she had sent to care for Isabella in the cellar to completely dissipate. [[7932 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps due to anxiety, or perhaps because the commotion from the battle on the ground was simply too great, Isabella, severely injured and unattended, relied solely on her own will to crawl out of the cellar, whose entrance was blocked by rubble, until she reached the battlefield and saw Celeste safe and sound. [[7933 旁白 fearful]]
"No, Evelyn, I should be thanking you. I..." [[7934 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella, limp in Lobelia's embrace, gave a weak smile. Even though she now knew Evelyn's true name and identity, after their previous conversation, she still preferred to call her Evelyn, because the name not only held the memories of their two years together but also felt more intimate. [[7935 旁白 neutral]]
"It's alright. The war is over. Your young lady is doing the final clean-up. You don't have to worry anymore." [[7936 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia slowly healed Isabella's internal injuries while offering comfort. [[7937 旁白 neutral]]
She had expected Isabella to gradually relax after being comforted, but unexpectedly, the grey-haired nun seemed to remember something, and her relaxed body suddenly tensed up again. [[7938 旁白 surprised]]
"Oh, right, Sister! Where's Sister Seraphina?!" [[7939 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
She turned her head, looking around for someone's figure, but what made her increasingly uneasy was this: in the flattened town, the only few figures seemed to be here, and the familiar gentle back she remembered was not among them. [[7940 旁白 fearful]]
"Isabella, that child already..." [[7941 梅黛亚 sad]]
Although she had not had much contact with Seraphina before, Medea understood who Isabella's "sister" referred to. She was hesitant and felt a pang of pity. [[7942 旁白 sad]]
Sensing that the atmosphere was wrong, Isabella, whose body was already weak, struggled violently, trying to get up. [[7943 旁白 fearful]]
"Isabella!" [[7944 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
The descent of a figure once again attracted everyone's attention. The grey-haired nun stopped struggling and stared blankly at Celeste, who appeared like an angel descended from heaven. [[7945 旁白 surprised]]
"Young lady, please tell me, Sister, what happened to her?" [[7946 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
Tears welled up in Isabella's eyes, and her voice choked. [[7947 旁白 sad]]
Celeste, who had just finished dealing with the residual evil god's power in the sky, remained silent, not answering immediately. He quickly walked to Isabella, knelt down, and cupped her face with both hands. [[7948 旁白 neutral]]
"Seraphina, she..." [[7949 塞莱斯特 sad]]
The maiden lowered her head slightly, and her voice also became somewhat low. Seeing this, Isabella's despair deepened. [[7950 旁白 sad]]
"She's not dead." [[7951 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
With a single sentence, surprise immediately dispersed the sadness. [[7952 旁白 surprised]]
Lobelia looked at everyone with a bewildered expression. [[7953 旁白 surprised]]
"Why does everyone look so utterly devastated? Do you really think I'm a Water Saintess for nothing?" [[7954 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Please, among the six Saintesses, those with obvious healing abilities were Light, Wind, and Water, and among them, the Water Saintess had the strongest healing ability, rumored to even reach the supreme realm of bringing the dead back to life and regenerating bones. [[7955 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
As the contemporary Water Saintess, it was perfectly normal for her to have strong healing abilities and be able to pull a self-destructing blood kin back from the brink of death, right? [[7956 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Under everyone's expectant gazes, Lobelia raised her right palm, and ripples of water spread across her palm. In the center of the ripples, a drop of blood, moisturized and held by the water light, was particularly conspicuous. [[7957 旁白 neutral]]
"This, how did you do this?" [[7958 梅黛亚 surprised]]
Medea felt she understood this child less and less. She had only stayed in this small town for decades; had magic development outside progressed to such an extent? [[7959 梅黛亚 surprised]]
"It's an innate ability. As for the principle, I can't explain it clearly. Anyway, when she self-destructed, I had a premonition and activated my domain beforehand. In my domain, no unit of life will temporarily be embraced by death." [[7960 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia casually spoke of an incredibly defying ability, not looking at the expressions and gazes of the crowd, but merely operating the unfamiliar and unskillful authority, continuously injecting pure life into that drop of blood. [[7961 旁白 neutral]]
The blood drop suspended in Lobelia's palm suddenly burst forth with brilliant vitality under the infusion of vast life force. It was no longer a lifeless object, but pulsed and expanded like a beating heart. The water light gently enveloped it, and the blood drop rapidly differentiated and extended, outlining a blurry human form—slender bones reborn like white jade, blood vessels and meridians intertwining and growing like vines, and lustrous skin condensing inch by inch in the soft blue light. [[7962 旁白 neutral]]
In the void, a curled, translucent figure gradually became clear. Seraphina's pale face reappeared in the shimmering water light, her tightly closed eyelashes trembling like butterfly wings. When the last trace of life energy was injected, the figure instantly solidified from ethereal to real! [[7963 旁白 surprised]]
"Cough... ugh!" [[7964 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
A sudden and weak gasp broke the silence. Seraphina abruptly opened her eyes, her amber pupils filled with a newborn-like confusion and alarm, as if she had been suddenly pulled back to the human world from an unfathomable abyss. [[7965 旁白 fearful]]
Her wet silver hair clung to her cheeks, and she was naked, gently supported by warm water elements, like a lost and found treasure, fragile and real, reappearing before everyone. As the water light dissipated, Celeste steadily caught her limp body. [[7966 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister!" [[7967 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
Isabella directly rushed forward, carefully and excitedly, tightly embracing Seraphina in the center. [[7968 旁白 happy]]
Watching the heartwarming reunion scene of the three, Lobelia felt a slight pleasure rising within her. The corners of her mouth naturally curved upward, and the water light in her eyes became a few shades clearer. [[7969 旁白 happy]]
However, while it was a joyful reunion, Seraphina and the Wind Saintess's gamble was too risky, and thus left behind some hidden dangers that had to be dealt with. [[7970 旁白 neutral]]
Entrusting the newly "resurrected" Seraphina to Isabella, Celeste rushed to Lobelia's side and immediately bowed without hesitation. Lobelia quickly used water to lift his body. [[7971 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you for your kindness. If it weren't for you, this time we..." [[7972 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
"It's alright. As fellow Saintesses, I can understand your feelings. From a certain perspective, your situation is even worse than mine. Even though the full authority of wisdom grants you the ability to discern the truth, you are still human and cannot truly make absolutely perfect choices." [[7973 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia, as always, was very understanding. [[7974 旁白 neutral]]
"But choices are choices, and the aftermath of some matters is indeed difficult to handle, such as that child's identity..." [[7975 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia spoke ambiguously, glancing again at the two sisters embracing and weeping. [[7976 旁白 sad]]
"Although my domain preserved her life, and the authority I control saved her once, her initial embrace lasted too long after all. Even with your blessing and protection, the reconstructed body still contains a large amount of blood kin bloodline, meaning..." [[7977 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"In a sense, Celeste, one of your Holy Nuns has permanently become a blood kin. This is irreversible." [[7978 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
As Lobelia said this, she looked at Celeste's beautiful eyes, which had returned to emerald green. Previously, Vlad had almost assimilated Celeste's body into a blood kin through the initial embrace ritual. However, because the final and most crucial soul purification step was not completed, later, with the help of the Wind God, Celeste resonated more deeply with her authority, and the Wind God's divinity naturally cleansed the foreign blood from her body, thus freeing her from the curse and restoring her human identity. [[7979 旁白 neutral]]
This was likely the original intention of Seraphina's plan: to achieve a "have your cake and eat it too" result by exploiting a bug in the initial embrace. Such an approach was too risky, and at minimum, would cost her own life. If she hadn't been present this time, Seraphina would never have survived. [[7980 旁白 neutral]]
But even if she survived, she would have to face the fact that she had permanently become a blood kin. Her original identity was a Holy Nun, and the sensitivity of her identity destined it to be difficult for her original master, Celeste, to make a choice. [[7981 旁白 neutral]]
"Lobelia, I'd like to ask you for a small favor. In return, I will give you an absolutely satisfactory reward." [[7982 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
