Chapter 94: Anomaly [[5299 旁白 neutral]]
The coffin, lifted by the wind, flew towards the silver space matrix. Everyone's breath tightened at this moment. Facing a sixth-tier being who had lived for thousands of years, no one dared to be careless. All four of them were cautious, giving their full attention. [[5300 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella, controlling the wind to push the coffin, had a thin layer of dense sweat beads on her forehead. Even as a fourth-tier mage, just touching the surface of the coffin with her magic, she could feel a bone-chilling coldness irresistibly eroding her body as it flowed through her magic... [[5301 旁白 neutral]]
Slowly, her knuckles, surrounded by teal wind magic, became completely numb. The cold wasn't a shiver from ordinary hypothermia, but like a sinister poisonous snake slowly climbing up your limbs and bones, finally flicking its crimson tongue, making the soul tremble. [[5302 旁白 fearful]]
This was the terror of a sixth-tier being. Even after being sealed for thousands of years with her soul and body separated, and with only a small part of the seal released, just the touch of her magic could make a fourth-tier Archmage sweat profusely. [[5303 旁白 fearful]]
Just, just a little longer, almost there... [[5304 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella constantly adjusted her breathing, trying her best to control her magic to avoid major fluctuations. The holy nun's firm belief ensured that her control over magic was flawless. [[5305 旁白 neutral]]
The metal coffin finally floated directly above the space matrix. Everyone sighed in relief. At this point, even if they released their magic, the heavy coffin would fall within the magic array's range and then be transported to its designated location by the activated space matrix. [[5306 旁白 neutral]]
With things progressing to this point, it was almost 99% complete, but Andre's face still showed no sign of relief. From his extensive experience, popping champagne halfway through such risky and difficult tasks often foreshadowed an unexpected event... [[5307 旁白 neutral]]
As a cautious priest, he didn't want to be elbowed by the Mother of Fate for no reason. [[5308 旁白 neutral]]
However, the truth was that everyone's faces were tense; no one showed any joy or relief. This was good, but the wild horse of fate always gallops in an uncontrollable direction. [[5309 旁白 neutral]]
Mother of Fate: I will elbow every child who pops champagne halfway. [[5310 命运之母 angry]]
Andre: We were serious throughout, respected fate, and never popped champagne halfway. [[5311 安德烈 neutral]]
Mother of Fate: Just kidding, I'll elbow you even if you don't pop champagne halfway! Only the strong deserve to survive in the surging tide of fate. [[5312 命运之母 angry]]
As the coffin was about to land, Isabella was gradually withdrawing the wind elements surrounding its exterior, but the iron coffin, which had been well-behaved until now, suddenly threw a tantrum. [[5313 旁白 neutral]]
The heavy coffin body began to tremble violently without warning. At the same time, in the silent and oppressive environment, a strange and clear heartbeat sounded! [[5314 旁白 fearful]]
It was definitely not a mishearing or hallucination of her own heartbeat, because that heartbeat, heavy as it was, contained a deep malice that anyone could feel. [[5315 旁白 fearful]]
That was definitely not a human heartbeat; it was so heavy and slow. More than a heartbeat, it was like a muffled grunt from a long-sleeping evil dragon slowly awakening! [[5316 旁白 fearful]]
The situation was not limited to this. That strange heartbeat seemed to trigger a chain reaction. Not only the coffin that had already been lifted, but also the other metal coffin still submerged in the water began to tremble. The sound of heartbeats, the normal sound of the coffins, and the increasingly rapid breathing of everyone, these sounds mixed together to create a strange resonance. [[5317 旁白 fearful]]
Facing the sudden situation, no one sat by idly. The first to react was Seraphina. The moment the anomaly occurred, she bit her fingertip and clapped both hands onto the silver spatial array drawn on the ground. [[5318 旁白 neutral]]
Crimson blood seeped into the silver rune lines, making them glow brighter, but also inevitably staining the array with a blood-red hue. [[5319 旁白 neutral]]
She shouted upwards. [[5320 旁白 neutral]]
"Quick, put the coffin down!" [[5321 塞拉菲娜 angry]]
The rapidly sweeping strong wind almost blew her words away. A teal light instantly enveloped the entire underground space. Isabella held her cross-spear, its shaft planted on the ground, her fair hands tightly gripping the shaft, her beautiful silver hair flying wildly in the wind. [[5322 旁白 neutral]]
At the critical moment, Isabella completely shed her usual laziness and slowness. Faced with the unexpected situation, she unhesitatingly unleashed her domain, not sparing her own magic. [[5323 旁白 neutral]]
The gentle wind, under Isabella's control, instantly became violent. Endless wind occupied all the space around the coffin. The wind, like large hands, squeezed the coffin from all directions. If it were an ordinary metal object, it would probably be crushed into a pile of scrap metal in the blink of an eye under the crushing wind, but now, apart from the booming sound of the wind hitting the coffin's surface, this heavy iron box showed no signs of deformation. [[5324 旁白 neutral]]
"No, I, I can't control it anymore!" [[5325 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
Isabella's knuckles, gripping the cross-spear, were white and blue from exertion. Sweat drenched her back. Even with the blessing of her wind element domain activated, she could clearly feel an irresistible immense force and terrifying power trying to break free from the "iron box." Her wind... couldn't suppress it! [[5326 旁白 fearful]]
The wind rings of discipline, tightly bound around the "iron box," also let out a mournful wail of being overwhelmed. The wind rings, purely constructed of elemental and divine power, were about to be torn apart and collapse under this force. [[5327 旁白 fearful]]
No sooner said than done, a white blur completely ignored the wind pressure and rushed directly towards the iron box in mid-air. Two beautiful arcs of silver light were drawn in the air. With a furious roar from the man, two heavy swords were firmly pinned to the sides of the coffin. [[5328 旁白 neutral]]
Golden light flowed in Andre's pupils, a sign of him releasing divine magic. [[5329 旁白 neutral]]
[Discipline] [[5330 旁白 neutral]]
Following the [Disciplined Wind Ring], another power of discipline was applied to the surface of the coffin. Golden chains entwined the areas missed by the wind ring. With the blessing of this power, the crimson liquid that had been faintly seeping out from the crack of the coffin lid, which had seemed about to open from the inside, was forcefully pushed back in. [[5331 旁白 neutral]]
The three of them worked together, but facing such forceful suppression, the Archduke of the Blood Clan inside the coffin clearly felt extremely angry. The "iron box" itself shook more violently than before, but that was all. The airtight triple suppression prevented her from infiltrating even a tiny bit of power from the seal... [[5332 旁白 angry]]
But did the matter end here? [[5333 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Isabella was about to breathe a sigh of relief, [[5334 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Isabella was about to breathe a sigh of relief, behind her, in the water pool, an astonishing bloody light erupted from the other coffin! [[5335 旁白 surprised]]
"No, the other one!" [[5336 旁白 fearful]]
