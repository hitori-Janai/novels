Chapter 68: The Queen [[3842 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the corpse lying at her feet, the pink-eyed succubus clicked her tongue in disgust and mercilessly kicked its head to the side. [[3843 旁白 neutral]]
She clapped her hands, her face showing no emotion from the recent killing, as if slaying a vampire was as trivial to her as crushing an ant. [[3844 旁白 neutral]]
Everything was her design. From giving her blood, to the dungeon, to her verbal guidance, the foolish vampire was led step by step into her trap. [[3845 旁白 neutral]]
A dog that dared to desire its master could not be allowed to live. Since he had drunk the succubus's blood, Sasha would have reacted one way or another, so she never planned to let him survive from the start. [[3846 旁白 neutral]]
The dungeon Sasha saw was just an illusion. After all, how could a holy church have a private prison? [[3847 旁白 neutral]]
They were in a storage room in the church that had been sealed with a barrier ahead of time. [[3848 旁白 neutral]]
After he drank her blood, not only was his lust aroused, but from the moment he opened his eyes, he was trapped in an illusion. Only when he had revealed most of his information and was no longer useful did the succubus kill him without hesitation. [[3849 旁白 neutral]]
After all, this succubus body had a natural, irresistible disgust for men. When Sasha hugged her leg earlier, she had already wanted to kill the filthy, sharp-fanged creature. [[3850 旁白 neutral]]
"I didn't expect Duke Vlad to actually be behind this plan." [[3851 塞伦安 surprised]]
The succubus rubbed her chin. Even though she tried to make her voice sound serious, the end of her words still carried a natural, flirtatious charm. [[3852 旁白 neutral]]
Since she was reborn into this world, the plot had already changed. She wasn't a prophet and couldn't predict the future, so she didn't know what would happen next. [[3853 旁白 neutral]]
As for why she mentioned Duke Vlad's name right away? [[3854 旁白 neutral]]
That was a complete coincidence. As a hard-core player in her past life, she knew almost every important character in the Nephalem continent, and the most famous one among the vampires was Grand Duke Vlad. [[3855 旁白 neutral]]
She had only intended to use Grand Duke Vlad's name to intimidate the little vampire in front of her and make him obey, but she didn't expect to be right. [[3856 旁白 neutral]]
So, Duke Vlad had planned everything with the goal of unsealing another vampire Grand Duke under the church. Why choose this specific time? [[3857 旁白 neutral]]
Sasha didn't know anything about that. Clearly, this humble little vampire baron wasn't important enough to know such information. [[3858 旁白 neutral]]
Was it to invade the empire? [[3859 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed unlikely. Kempfa was an ordinary small town, and it wasn't on the border between the empire and the demon territory. Even if the demons spent a lot of resources to send troops here and successfully captured the church to release the vampire Grand Duke, it wouldn't change the fact that this place was deep within the empire's territory. [[3860 旁白 neutral]]
Spatial teleportation could be used once or twice, but it couldn't support a large-scale war. Even if the released vampire Grand Duke was strong, the Church and the empire were not weak. Once they reacted and gathered their forces, the newly freed vampire Grand Duke would still be finished. [[3861 旁白 neutral]]
The great demons of the Demon World weren't stupid. They wouldn't do something so self-defeating. [[3862 旁白 neutral]]
So what was the reason? Was it just to annoy the Church? [[3863 旁白 neutral]]
That was also unlikely. [[3864 旁白 neutral]]
The Saintess? [[3865 旁白 neutral]]
She thought of a final possibility, but even if they wanted to harm the Saintess, they would need to set up an ambush in a big city like Roland for it to be effective, right? [[3866 旁白 neutral]]
The Demon World, much like the Church, had a strict hierarchy. They couldn't be unaware that the chances of the Saintess coming to a small place like Kempfa were almost zero. If they released the vampire Grand Duke and the Saintess wasn't there, it would be a major strategic failure. [[3867 旁白 neutral]]
The succubus couldn't figure it out for a moment, so she stopped thinking about it. She memorized the important information, then waved her hand. A mirror made of pure magic appeared in front of her, reflecting her image. [[3868 旁白 neutral]]
In the mirror, the succubus leaned against a blood-stained stone wall, moonlight flowing from her dark horns down to her heart-shaped tail, which was covered in barbs. A dark red leather top barely covered the forbidden areas, with crisscrossing straps creating diamond-shaped openings on her pale waist. The high-slit leather skirt slid up to her thigh as she lifted her leg, revealing fair skin with thorn tattoos. [[3869 旁白 neutral]]
Oh, what a tempting demon. Even her clothes are so shameless. [[3870 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An thought to himself, evaluating his current appearance. [[3871 塞伦安 neutral]]
In the past four years, he had many opportunities to appear as both the Saintess and as a man, both of whom had legal identities in the outside world. But this succubus body was the one he had used the least... [[3872 旁白 neutral]]
This wasn't just because showing his succubus form was the riskiest. More importantly, the desires in his heart would grow exponentially. A normal person's will would find it hard to suppress this instinct engraved in his bloodline. Fortunately, she also had the bloodline of the Saintess, just like now— [[3873 旁白 neutral]]
The succubus's body began to tremble with desire. A ripple of azure blue appeared in her pink, heart-shaped eyes, and the desire was calmed and suppressed. Her body stopped shaking. [[3874 旁白 neutral]]
"Phew, that was close." [[3875 塞伦安 fearful]]
The girl habitually patted her chest, feeling relieved. [[3876 旁白 neutral]]
If she didn't have to use her succubus body to get information from these sharp-fanged creatures, she would never have put herself through the torture of burning desire followed by forced abstinence! [[3877 旁白 neutral]]
After quickly cleaning up the scene, she changed back into her priest form and walked out with the information she had gathered. [[3878 旁白 neutral]]
... [[3879 旁白 neutral]]
... [[3880 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, in the Demon World. [[3881 旁白 neutral]]
In the vast territory of Vinus, there stood a magnificent castle. Vinus was the surname of the current Succubus Queen, and the one living in the castle was, naturally, the current Succubus Queen. [[3882 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah~" [[3883 莎缇拉 happy]]
A soft moan suddenly came from Satella's bedroom. The pale-haired queen stirred, instinctively rolling out of her soft bed and twisting on it excitedly like a dancing child. [[3884 旁白 neutral]]
The maid sleeping peacefully on the side of the bed was startled by the sudden movement. The short-haired succubus rubbed her sleepy eyes, looking at a scene she hadn't witnessed in hundreds of years, and cautiously asked. [[3885 旁白 neutral]]
"Lady Satella... what's wrong...?" [[3886 女仆 surprised]]
"Hmm~" [[3887 莎缇拉 happy]]
Satella didn't answer directly. Instead, she hummed a pleasant tune and skipped to the mirror beside her bed. She pulled aside her clothes, revealing a faint, light-red, heart-shaped mark glowing on her firm, beautiful abdomen. [[3888 旁白 neutral]]
"Is that... the Princess?" [[3889 女仆 surprised]]
The maid's eyes widened, her sleepiness completely gone. [[3890 旁白 neutral]]
"Mhm~" [[3891 莎缇拉 happy]]
Satella instinctively caressed the mark on her stomach in the mirror, like a pregnant woman, but her face held a strange confusion. [[3892 旁白 neutral]]
"From the aura, it is indeed my daughter. But this aura doesn't belong to either of my two daughters. It's a completely new individual." [[3893 莎缇拉 surprised]]
"?" [[3894 女仆 surprised]]
The maid tilted her head, a large question mark appearing above it. [[3895 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone knew that succubi were a race born of lust, so they never lacked offspring. In a world where it was difficult for the powerful to have children, it was remarkable that the young Satella already had two daughters. [[3896 旁白 neutral]]
But even if succubi were fertile, they usually needed their own wombs to bear children. As her maid, she didn't understand how the queen had secretly had another daughter when she had delivered and raised both of the queen's princesses herself. [[3897 旁白 neutral]]
She turned to look at Satella's expression. Clearly, she was also confused. [[3898 旁白 neutral]]
But soon, the maid seemed to think of something and spoke up. [[3899 旁白 neutral]]
"Lady Satella, have you created a Succubus Seed recently?" [[3900 女仆 neutral]]
The confused queen was stunned for a moment, then her pink, heart-shaped eyes lit up. [[3901 莎缇拉 surprised]]
"Creating a Succubus Seed is something that low-to-mid-level succubi do. Since becoming queen, I have never done such a thing. However, before that, shortly after I advanced to the sixth rank, I was forced to create a Succubus Seed due to the overwhelming desire and magic in my body..." [[3902 莎缇拉 neutral]]
"That seed wasn't properly nurtured in the mother's body, so it was a dead seed. Even if it were implanted in someone, it would be very difficult for them to inherit my bloodline, and they would become a useless succubus with no lineage." [[3903 莎缇拉 sad]]
Satella recalled the past while poking her chin. [[3904 旁白 neutral]]
"Then, my lady, that Succubus Seed, you eventually..." [[3905 女仆 neutral]]
"I gave it away. To the current Demon King." [[3906 莎缇拉 neutral]]
The elegant queen shrugged and said without any hesitation. [[3907 旁白 neutral]]
