Chapter 19: A Mysterious Voice [[1155 旁白 neutral]]
An ice-blue barrier split the world in two. [[1156 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the barrier, a new life born into this world let out its first cry. The baby's wailing pierced through the barrier's soundproofing, playing the symphony of birth. [[1157 旁白 neutral]]
Outside the barrier, rain and frost played a dirge. Rainwater and blood splattered and mixed. With the night sky as her canvas and blood as her paint, the young woman used her sword to paint a scene of slaughter and death upon this vision of hell on earth. [[1158 旁白 fearful]]
The pregnant woman lay on the bed. Anna was so exhausted from assisting with the birth that her body went limp. The first person to hold the child was surprisingly Selen An, who had no blood relation to them. [[1159 旁白 neutral]]
In this setting, the newborn's cries were piercingly sharp. Holding the infant, Selen An felt like he was holding a red-hot iron, and he had the urge to throw it. [[1160 塞伦安 fearful]]
But he stopped himself from having such a dangerous thought. He had just risked everything to help the woman on the bed give birth to this child. Tossing it away now would mean denying all his previous efforts, wouldn't it? [[1161 塞伦安 neutral]]
He didn't know where the sudden strength that pushed him to act so out of character had come from. But since the child was born with his help, his basic human conscience wouldn't let him abandon this new life. [[1162 塞伦安 neutral]]
He quickly grabbed the ice shears nearby, cut the umbilical cord, and casually wrapped the baby in a torn piece of cloth. He handed the bundle to Anna, who had gotten to her feet, and finally let out a sigh of relief. [[1163 旁白 neutral]]
The swaddled infant was a premature boy, wrinkled and tiny like a little red monkey. Anna took her younger brother, but before she could get a good look, she felt a tug on her skirt. [[1164 旁白 neutral]]
The woman on the wooden bed had blood trickling from the corners of her mouth, her lips pale as paper. Even so, her incredibly weak eyes were fixed on her own flesh and blood, the baby her daughter was holding. [[1165 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps there truly is a special connection between a mother and child that others can't see. As the woman tugged Anna's skirt, the baby in the bundle began to cry even louder. [[1166 旁白 neutral]]
"My child... my child..." [[1167 母亲 sad]]
The woman's voice was heartbreakingly weak. Anna carefully placed her brother in their mother's arms. Looking at the baby, whose hands and feet were as small as an adult's thumb, the woman began to cry, though it wasn't clear if it was from guilt or pain. [[1168 旁白 sad]]
"Help me... undress..." [[1169 母亲 sad]]
She must have had no strength left, as she spoke with frequent pauses. [[1170 旁白 neutral]]
The two in the room froze for a second before they understood. Selen An quickly turned his back, while Anna lifted her mother's blouse, trying to quiet the baby whether there was milk or not. [[1171 旁白 neutral]]
After a moment of rustling, the nerve-wracking screams finally stopped. [[1172 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Selen An thought it was over and was about to relax, the young woman's panicked cry from behind him made his nerves tense up all over again! [[1173 旁白 surprised]]
"Mother, wake up! The bleeding... it won't stop!" [[1174 安娜 fearful]]
Her cry, laced with tears, made his heart stop. He spun around and rushed to the bedside, the smell of blood suddenly stronger. He looked down and saw a pool of blood on the floor. The dress of the woman who had just given birth was already stained red. [[1175 旁白 fearful]]
That's a lot of blood... [[1176 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An understood the severity of the situation with just one glance. [[1177 旁白 neutral]]
Postpartum hemorrhage? [[1178 塞伦安 fearful]]
Sweat soaked his back, making his clothes stick to his skin. They say when it rains, it pours. Today's disasters were coming one after another, pushing him to the brink... [[1179 塞伦安 fearful]]
Postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of death for mothers even in the modern era with its advanced medical technology. If it's that dangerous now, what about in this world with no medical facilities? [[1180 旁白 fearful]]
In this situation, it's almost a certain death sentence. [[1181 旁白 fearful]]
Wait, the Nephalem continent might not have advanced medicine, but it has magic that defies science! [[1182 塞伦安 hopeful]]
The good news is that healing magic can ignore logic and cure illnesses directly. The bad news is that neither of the two people in the room knew any healing magic. As for the one outside, Serenia, who was fighting alone, probably wasn't skilled in it either... [[1183 旁白 neutral]]
And even if she was, she wouldn't have the chance to use it. Facing an endless army of demons, Serenia was already using all her strength just to hold them back. [[1184 旁白 sad]]
There's nothing to be done. He had already done his best. Helping her deliver the baby was already more than he should have been able to do. Asking a normal person who never studied medicine and can't use magic to save a woman suffering from massive postpartum bleeding was just impossible. [[1185 塞伦安 sad]]
He really couldn't do it... [[1186 塞伦安 sad]]
A sense of powerlessness washed over him again. He didn't understand why. He had already done everything he could, even more than expected. But seeing the unconscious woman on the bed, the grieving, desperate girl beside her, and the baby, who was crying like a kitten now that he wasn't being fed... [[1187 塞伦安 sad]]
Why did his heart ache with such sharp pangs? [[1188 塞伦安 sad]]
He knew he wasn't a great humanitarian. He had normal sympathy for others, but in a situation where his own life was at risk, he would always prioritize his own safety. As for any lingering influence from this body's original owner? [[1189 塞伦安 neutral]]
That was even more absurd. The real villain, Selen An, would have abandoned this mother and daughter and fled for his life long ago. [[1190 旁白 neutral]]
So why? This guilt that wasn't his, that reckless rescue he shouldn't have attempted, and now... the restless, aching heart in his chest. [[1191 塞伦安 sad]]
What was happening to him? Why was he becoming so unlike himself? [[1192 塞伦安 fearful]]
He put a hand to his forehead, feeling dizzy. At the same time, besides the young woman's sobs and the infant's cries, he heard something else... [[1193 塞伦安 surprised]]
"Save them... Use your hands to drive away death and sickness... No living being can take another's life without reason... If they do, then use your hands, your voice, your blood, to stop it... This is your promise, your mission..." [[1194 陌生女1 neutral]]
That ethereal female voice, like a phantom yet incredibly gentle, seemed to echo directly in his mind. The voice was like an invisible, delicate hand, caressing his face like a mother, whispering softly in his ear. [[1195 旁白 neutral]]
In a daze, he thought he saw the source of the voice. It drifted before his eyes like smoke, then suddenly turned back, illusory as water. He subconsciously reached out to touch it, but just as he was about to make contact, the vision shattered. His outstretched hand felt something cold and hard in his palm. He looked closely— [[1196 旁白 surprised]]
Somehow, he was holding the ice shears Serenia had left behind. The unfamiliar woman's voice still echoed faintly in his ears. [[1197 旁白 surprised]]
"With your hands, your voice, your blood..." [[1198 陌生女1 neutral]]
Selen An stared blankly at his palm, then at the dying woman on the bed. Unseen by him, a faint blue light flashed and vanished in the depths of his dark brown eyes. [[1199 旁白 neutral]]
"I..." [[1200 塞伦安 fearful]]
His voice trembled slightly. He wasn't hesitating or struggling, but rather, he was afraid. Afraid of the voice and power that seemed to override his own will and influence this body. [[1201 塞伦安 fearful]]
He was afraid of no longer being himself. The crying continued... [[1202 旁白 sad]]
Until the dull sound of a sharp object piercing flesh was followed by the faint, sweet smell of blood trickling from between his fingers. [[1203 旁白 fearful]]
