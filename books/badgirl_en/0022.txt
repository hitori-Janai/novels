Chapter 22: Reset 22 - Damn it, they're still chasing! [[1315 旁白 angry]]
Rain fell from the sky, but froze into ice before touching the ground, dancing with the wind. [[1316 旁白 neutral]]
Before this, the storm and rain were their enemies, but now, the forces of nature, wrapped in an ice-blue magical glow, had become the sharpest sword in their hands! [[1317 旁白 neutral]]
Ice and snow set the main tone for this blizzard's song, and half the wasteland shook from the sudden, huge commotion as if it were the apocalypse. [[1318 旁白 fearful]]
The temperature in the air dropped rapidly, and white frost began to cover the surface of every touchable object, not even sparing the hard, rough, black armor of the demon soldiers. Under the corrosion of the extreme cold, everything, whether living or not, became extremely fragile. [[1319 旁白 neutral]]
Many demon soldiers in the front were the first to be hit. Before they could react, they were covered in white frost. Then, caught in the inescapable blizzard, they were torn to pieces by the powerful storm like fragile sheets of paper. [[1320 旁白 fearful]]
In the dark wasteland, a sun of ice began to rise, accompanied by what sounded like a great dragon's roar. [[1321 旁白 surprised]]
Beneath the ice sun in the dark night, the pale frost and snow seemed to form the phantom of a holy ice dragon. Its mouth opened as if to swallow the icy sun, the source of the endless dragon's roar. [[1322 旁白 surprised]]
This divine spell, a blow that struck the souls of everyone present, seemed to show the world the mighty power of the holy element. At the center of the light, the silver-haired Saintess was surrounded by countless divine halos. The radiance of the gods shone upon her as she condensed ice, blew frost, and drove the snow. The power that could make all things stand still was the breath of ice. [[1323 旁白 neutral]]
The wild dance of ice and snow was unleashed with the holy dragon's roar. As she raised her hands, the white snow falling from the sky flew upward instead! [[1324 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, her figure no longer seemed human. Her blurred form revealed a pure divinity. It was as if an ice god danced, its flowing skirt kicking up a pale wave. The young woman's chanting was like a soaring song, like a movement in a sacred ritual. [[1325 旁白 neutral]]
At the edge of the blizzard, the demon general Kegsa stared intently at the strange sight connecting heaven and earth, a rare look of gravity in his flame-like eyes. [[1326 旁白 neutral]]
After being worn down so much, he didn't expect the Saintess to still be able to unleash such power. The force of the divine spell far exceeded his predictions; otherwise, he wouldn't have let his army get so close to the barrier. [[1327 克格萨 surprised]]
But it was useless to say anything now. If the soldiers in the front were dead, they were dead. To be buried under the terrifying power of such a divine spell, the weak among his kin were destined to be nothing more than cannon fodder. And the deaths of his cannon fodder kin were not meaningless... [[1328 克格萨 neutral]]
Divine spells are powerful not only because the caster can borrow a measure of a god's power, but also because the price for casting one is something no ordinary person can bear. [[1329 克格萨 neutral]]
Once the power of this divine spell fades, the Ice Saintess, having exhausted all her strength, will be a lamb for the slaughter. [[1330 克格萨 neutral]]
This was an unexpected gain. The original plan was just to take the Winterlein boy. I didn't expect the current Saintess from the Glacies family to be so foolishly cute, putting herself in danger for a blasphemous traitor. [[1331 克格萨 neutral]]
With such a foolish choice, I certainly won't pass up a buy-one-get-one-free opportunity. [[1332 克格萨 neutral]]
If I can capture two direct descendants of a Saintess at once, then my status in the Demon General's council will skyrocket. I might even be able to claim a spot in the top three. [[1333 克格萨 happy]]
Thinking this, his single exposed, blood-red eye couldn't help but burn with greedy fire, as if he couldn't wait to grab the weak humans and enjoy defiling them. [[1334 克格萨 happy]]
Serenia had created such a huge commotion that she had drawn nearly everyone's attention. But in a place no one was watching, two figures were running desperately through a clearing that the divine spell had made in the pale blizzard. [[1335 旁白 neutral]]
The power of the ice, which could easily freeze and tear flesh, was nullified by an ice-blue barrier of light around them. On the back of the young man's hand, an ancient blue magic pattern glowed. It was the ice and snow "pass" that Serenia had left on him for his escape. [[1336 旁白 neutral]]
All threats from the ice and snow vanished the moment they came into contact with them. [[1337 旁白 neutral]]
But even so, the escape was incredibly difficult. Selen An was practically dragging Anna, who followed behind him. The young woman clutched a newborn in her thin coat, but her head was turned back. Warm tears streamed down her face as she ran, falling to the ground and freezing into ice. [[1338 旁白 sad]]
"Mother!" [[1339 安娜 sad]]
She cried out in uncontrollable grief, watching the two figures behind her grow fainter and fainter. [[1340 旁白 sad]]
When surrounded, the only way to survive was to break out. As the Saintess, Serenia was responsible for tearing open a gap, drawing attention, and covering the rear. Those who broke out needed to seize the opportunity and run for the designated location. [[1341 旁白 neutral]]
Among them, Anna's mother, who had just given birth, had trouble moving. Bringing her along would have greatly slowed the escape and increased the danger. [[1342 旁白 neutral]]
The gentle mother, clearly aware of this, chose to stay behind, giving the hope of life to her two children. [[1343 旁白 sad]]
The wind carried the girl's cries to the young man's ears. Selen An was sweating with anxiety. In this life-or-death moment, his heart was beating so fast it felt like it would explode. With his brain flooded with blood, his senses were abnormally sharp. [[1344 塞伦安 fearful]]
The divine spell's power was already weakening after its initial, ferocious phase. In the lingering blizzard, a demon with a familiar aura was braving the cold and snow, chasing right after him. [[1345 塞伦安 fearful]]
Damn it, the demons are still chasing me! [[1346 塞伦安 angry]]
Selen An was so angry he wanted to curse. Serenia's attack was like a miracle, a divine manifestation. Any normal creature would be terrified after seeing its power and the miserable state of their comrades. Even the emotionally detached demons should have hesitated, feeling their lives were threatened. [[1347 塞伦安 angry]]
But the one chasing him now seemed to feel no pain or fear, ignoring the threat of the ice and snow and rapidly closing in. [[1348 塞伦安 fearful]]
In the blizzard, a purple-skinned Mara frantically beat her fleshy wings. The extreme cold felt like steel knives scraping her skin, making her expression ferocious with pain. At the same time, her resentment toward Selen An grew stronger. [[1349 玛拉 angry]]
She had personally planted the Succubus Seed in Selen An, so she was familiar with its aura. She had to catch him herself this time. If he escaped again, or if another demon soldier caught him, she would fail to prove her worth to the Demon General and would surely suffer an unspeakable punishment. [[1350 玛拉 fearful]]
High-ranking demons had absolute power over lower-ranking ones. Remembering what Demon General Kegsa had said to her, Mara endured the searing pain of her skin being torn and desperately flew toward the aura. [[1351 玛拉 fearful]]
Finally, two dark figures running in the snow appeared in her vision. [[1352 玛拉 neutral]]
"Master Selen An, this time, I will not let you get away!" [[1353 玛拉 angry]]
Mara's hoarse voice, like a dark thunderclap, mixed with the wind and exploded in the young man's ears. [[1354 玛拉 angry]]
