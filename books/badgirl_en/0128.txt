Chapter 128: The Wind Tore Through the Shadow (8000) [[7665 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh dear, what bad luck. The weather today is so awful, and yet I still met a few distinguished ladies out here..." [[7666 旁白 neutral]]
"Could it be that the ladies are all rushing back to collect their laundry, just like me?" [[7667 旁白 neutral]]
A lazy voice suddenly came from behind, seeming very out of place on this serious battlefield. [[7668 旁白 neutral]]
Maedeya was the first to turn around. As a priestess who had dedicated most of her life to the town, she could quickly identify who the newcomer was just by their voice. [[7669 旁白 neutral]]
"Matthew, why are you still here? Didn't you already retreat with the others through the tunnel?" [[7670 梅黛亚 neutral]]
Under the sun-obscuring black smoke, the power of the three Fifth-Tier experts seemed a little strained. A sudden appearance of an ordinary person, completely unrelated to the battle, and an old acquaintance from the town at that, how could Maedeya, who regarded the townspeople as family, be at ease? [[7671 旁白 neutral]]
Matthew, dressed in rags and still clutching his worn-out harp, scratched his messy, bird's nest-like hair in embarrassment. [[7672 旁白 neutral]]
"I was halfway there, and suddenly felt the wind was too strong. I remembered I had two pieces of clothing left outside, so I turned back." [[7673 马修 neutral]]
"..." [[7674 旁白 neutral]]
Such an unreliable answer left Maedeya speechless for a moment, unable to retort or scold him, because... based on her many years of interaction and deep understanding of the townspeople's personalities, Matthew could really do such a thing! [[7675 旁白 neutral]]
Or rather, it seemed all the bards in Windermere Territory had some kind of serious problem with their personalities, always liking to do incredibly unreliable things in both crucial and non-crucial situations. [[7676 旁白 neutral]]
"No, you can't stay here, I will now..." [[7677 梅黛亚 neutral]]
Even though she had gone through a great battle, her body was already exhausted, and she had little magic left. Still, Maedeya insisted on teleporting Matthew out; this was her duty as a priestess. [[7678 旁白 neutral]]
"Wait!" [[7679 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
But before she could fully act, one of Celeste's hands had already pressed heavily on her shoulder, stopping her with words. [[7680 旁白 neutral]]
Maedeya was puzzled but saw the green-haired girl pass behind her, her young, unworldly face showing a rare seriousness. [[7681 旁白 neutral]]
"Who exactly are you?" [[7682 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
She questioned, her emerald eyes filled with vigilance. [[7683 旁白 neutral]]
The red-haired witch was confused and shocked. This sudden change in tone also indirectly reminded her: how did an ordinary person manage to run back into town unharmed through the aftermath of such an intense battle? [[7684 旁白 neutral]]
Also, Celeste's hand on her shoulder was uncontrollably clenching tighter and tighter. This subtle movement made her resonate with the increasing pressure in the Saintess's heart. [[7685 旁白 fearful]]
The truth was exactly that. Celeste's willow-like brows were tightly furrowed. Since birth, she had never been as nervous as she was today, because her eyes... couldn't see through the other person! [[7686 旁白 fearful]]
In her vision, she clearly saw Matthew enveloped in a hazy wind. It was this wind that blocked her from seeing the truth. [[7687 旁白 neutral]]
The Wind Saintess, who could not be deceived, was unable to see through the true form of an "ordinary person." [[7688 旁白 surprised]]
What kind of absurd joke was this? [[7689 旁白 surprised]]
Her "truth-seeing" ability came from the authority of wisdom. The fact that it could be obstructed meant that the other party at least controlled a corresponding or counteracting authority. [[7690 旁白 neutral]]
The power of authority, apart from the divine favored ones who possessed divine blood, only "supreme experts" who had reached the Seventh-Tier and stepped into the demigod realm possessed it. [[7691 旁白 neutral]]
No matter which one the other party was, it was absolutely... [[7692 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey hey hey hey?! This lady looks unfamiliar. Do we have some kind of grievance between us?" [[7693 马修 neutral]]
Matthew seemed to be startled by Celeste's aura and took half a step back, his expression and actions completely in line with an ordinary person's reaction. [[7694 旁白 neutral]]
"Isn't that obvious?" [[7695 马修 neutral]]
Saying that, he also raised the worn-out harp in his hand. [[7696 旁白 neutral]]
"I am a resident of Kempfa Town, and also a bard. Priestess Maedeya and Miss Evelyn can testify for me." [[7697 马修 neutral]]
The slovenly bard cast a pleading look at the two. [[7698 旁白 neutral]]
"Matthew, you..." [[7699 梅黛亚 neutral]]
The situation, already chaotic due to the arrival of the Evil God, became even more muddled by Matthew's abnormality. Maedeya didn't know what to say. [[7700 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Evelyn, please help me speak up! I'm your most loyal fan, you must know me, right?" [[7701 马修 sad]]
The poor bard seemed to have placed his last hope on Rosalia, his emerald eyes as innocent as could be. [[7702 旁白 sad]]
But the response he received was... [[7703 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Matthew, I do recognize you." [[7704 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"You see, this isn't..." [[7705 马修 neutral]]
"However, I only know Mr. Matthew, but I do not know a mysterious expert who can instantly pull three Fifth-Tier individuals from the center of an Evil God's descent." [[7706 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The girl's calm words made the bard's expression increasingly stiff. [[7707 旁白 neutral]]
"So, instead of Matthew and the identity of a bard, it would be more appropriate for me to call you Lord Wind God, wouldn't it?" [[7708 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
As soon as these words came out, everyone was shocked. [[7709 旁白 surprised]]
Celeste seemed to have been enlightened by something, her pupils shrinking slightly as she stared in disbelief at this unkempt, slovenly poet. [[7710 旁白 surprised]]
Maedeya, upon hearing Rosalia's answer, clutched her forehead, feeling dizzy and almost unable to stand steady, nearly fainting on the spot. [[7711 旁白 surprised]]
"Lord... Wind God..." [[7712 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
Celeste mumbled the honorific, then suddenly knelt on one knee before the ungraceful Matthew. [[7713 旁白 neutral]]
"I implore Lord Wind God, save the people of Windermere Territory from suffering!" [[7714 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
Even the Pope, the supreme leader of the Church, could not enjoy such an honor. Only the god they believed in could make a Saintess kneel. [[7715 旁白 neutral]]
This kneeling was of great significance, almost solidifying Matthew's identity, whether he admitted it himself or not. [[7716 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey..." [[7717 马修 neutral]]
This time, Matthew did not recoil in fear like a normal person, daring not to accept the Saintess's reverence. He merely sighed helplessly, then glanced at the blue-haired girl beside him, who wore a subtle smile. [[7718 旁白 neutral]]
"Rosalia, you're still so lacking in humor." [[7719 马修 neutral]]
"The Water Saintess never lies. I am merely adhering to my own principles and stating the facts." [[7720 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The girl shook her head, neither humble nor arrogant. [[7721 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, since you're all so convinced, I won't pretend anymore. I'm revealing my hand. Standing before you is none other than the Wind God himself!" [[7722 马修 neutral]]
With a "whoosh," his aura completely changed. It was as if an invisible wind lifted Matthew's form, and even his previously sloppy and worn clothes seemed to have been imbued with a special meaning, fluttering and swaying. [[7723 旁白 surprised]]
Celeste looked up, her emerald eyes shining with joy. [[7724 旁白 happy]]
It's the Wind God, we are saved, Windermere Territory is saved! [[7725 旁白 happy]]
Indeed, when the Evil God intended to corrupt the free land, the benevolent God of Wisdom would never allow His people to struggle in the depths of suffering. [[7726 旁白 neutral]]
So, He made His move! [[7727 旁白 neutral]]
The Wind God has come, the territory is at peace! The Wind God has come, and the clear sky is here! [[7728 旁白 happy]]
For some reason, Celeste felt as if she heard a faint, ethereal chant filled with a foreign flavor. [[7729 旁白 neutral]]
The aura was there, the presence was there, the build-up was there. Everything was ready, all that was needed was the east wind! [[7730 旁白 neutral]]
The two noble Saintesses looked up at Xia Fan, the Wind God who saved humanity from suffering, waiting for this wise deity to clear the black mist shrouding the sky with decisive action. [[7731 旁白 neutral]]
Matthew, floating in mid-air, with his hands behind his back, suppressed the playful smile on his face. Like an otherworldly expert, he gazed at the dark sky. In his green pupils, wind seemed to flow, parting the black mist and taking in the scenes from thousands of miles away. [[7732 旁白 neutral]]
He saw— [[7733 旁白 neutral]]
The once lush forests withered and died at a visible rate, their green leaves instantly scorched black and curled, as if burned by an invisible fire. The fertile fields were covered in a decaying lifelessness. The crops that had just headed quickly rotted under the erosion of foul energy, emitting a sickeningly sweet stench. The clear streams became viscous as ink, fish and shrimp floated belly-up, their corpses piled up. [[7734 旁白 fearful]]
Towns and villages were even more chaotic. Panic-stricken residents were chased and corroded by black smoke, many painfully huddled on the ground, their skin covered with ominous black patterns. Docile livestock had blood-red eyes, wildly crashing against fences and biting their kin, emitting mournful howls. Even the birds in the sky lost their direction, crashing into cliffs and buildings like uncontrolled arrows, leaving behind dazzling bloodstains. [[7735 旁白 fearful]]
Life was withering, order was collapsing, and darkness greedily devoured every shred of light and vitality on this free land. Matthew's figure, suspended in mid-air, that newly condensed, slightly cynical divine aura, was gradually replaced by a heavy and cold anger. [[7736 旁白 angry]]
He slowly raised his hand, and a wisp of emerald wind, condensed to the extreme, as if it could cut through void, swirled around his fingertips. [[7737 旁白 neutral]]
In contrast, the black smoke in the sky seemed to be summoned by some power, gathering and compressing until a pair of cold, crimson Evil God eyes opened from within, looking down upon this land suffering an undeserved calamity. [[7738 旁白 fearful]]
"Cain, you've crossed the line." [[7739 马修 angry]]
The ethereal voice pierced through the clouds, carrying divine majesty, no longer the lazy tone of the town bard. [[7740 旁白 neutral]]
In the sky, the crimson giant eye made of condensed black smoke suddenly shrank, as if stung by this declaration. Immediately after, the black smoke across the entire sky boiled, emitting a soul-shaking shriek! [[7741 旁白 fearful]]
Countless black smoke coalesced into twisted, clawed tentacles, like a furious black tsunami, carrying destructive, foul energy, crashing down overwhelmingly towards Matthew, or rather, the Wind God, who was suspended in mid-air! [[7742 旁白 fearful]]
The momentum was so immense, far exceeding the sum of the attacks endured by the three Fifth-Tier experts before. Space itself seemed to be tearing apart from this pure malice. [[7743 旁白 fearful]]
Facing this terrifying strike that could instantly annihilate the entire town of Kempfa, the last trace of helplessness on Matthew's face completely vanished. In his emerald pupils, the emerald wind surged and spun, and the extremely condensed wind blade at his fingertips suddenly lit up, as if he held the first wisp of clear wind that opened the heavens and earth. [[7744 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmph!" [[7745 马修 angry]]
A cold snort, carrying divine indifference and anger. He raised his fingertip and gently swiped forward, meeting the destructive torrent. [[7746 旁白 neutral]]
There was no earth-shattering roar, only a subtle but incredibly clear "shiiing" sound, as if space itself was being sliced open. The emerald wind line, as thin as hair, yet irresistibly sharp, silently cut into the furiously falling dark torrent! [[7747 旁白 neutral]]
Brilliant green light shattered the raging dark torrent and completely cleared the pair of evil god eyes filled with malicious indifference from the sky. [[7748 旁白 neutral]]
Having witnessed such immense power firsthand, Celeste had no doubt about the identity of the person before her. Although a Saintess was the spokesperson of a god, the depth of the connection between a Saintess and a god depended on the god's own character and will. [[7749 旁白 neutral]]
Just like the Lunarise Territory far to the west, that land was protected by the righteous God of Light. As told by believers, the connection between the Light Saintess who walked the earth and the God of Light was incredibly close, their wills almost entirely identical. [[7750 旁白 neutral]]
As for herself, apart from the Saintess's enthronement and coronation ceremony, only that one time did she truly feel the descent of divine consciousness. At that time, being still young, she felt the divine nature of wind and was particularly excited and nervous. Since the next step was an extremely sacred process of interacting with the divine, the result was... [[7751 旁白 neutral]]
The free Wind God merely brought a wisp of clear breeze, patted her head, bestowed a blessing, indicating His approval of her, and then everything ended. [[7752 旁白 neutral]]
However, whether it was the God of Light who liked to do everything Himself, or the inherently free and untamed God of Wind, they were essentially gods who wielded complete authority, the great creators and managers of this world. [[7753 旁白 neutral]]
The righteous gods of creation would never allow chaotic evil gods to act recklessly on the land they created. Look! The free Wind God would thoroughly shatter the evil god's delusion with His wisdom! [[7754 旁白 neutral]]
In the sky, that disgusting consciousness completely disappeared. At least in Kempfa's sky, apart from the black smoke becoming thicker, there was no longer that pair of large eyes overlooking the world. [[7755 旁白 neutral]]
Matthew landed gracefully, his hands behind his back, exuding an extraordinary demeanor. [[7756 旁白 neutral]]
"It's over." [[7757 马修 neutral]]
He calmly uttered these two words, making Celeste instantly let out a sigh of relief. Since Lord Wind God had confidently declared it was over, then Evil God Cain was truly finished. [[7758 旁白 neutral]]
"What you mean to say isn't that *you're* finished, is it?" [[7759 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Truly sharp, Rosalia." [[7760 马修 neutral]]
"?!" [[7761 旁白 surprised]]
The expressions of the two individuals and one god were all different, and the air seemed to freeze at that moment. [[7762 旁白 surprised]]
Celeste doubted her ears. What did she just hear? [[7763 旁白 surprised]]
Lord Wind God, who had just displayed supreme power and shattered the Evil God's strength, said that *he* was finished? [[7764 旁白 surprised]]
Is this a joke? [[7765 旁白 angry]]
If it's not a joke, this joke isn't funny at all! [[7766 旁白 angry]]
"Lord Wind God, this..." [[7767 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
"Hey, don't call me Wind God, I can't bear such a title." [[7768 马修 neutral]]
Denying his identity immediately after showing off made the two conscious people present feel speechless. [[7769 旁白 neutral]]
"Alas, how can you still be Saintesses and not know the rule: 'A righteous god does not descend to the mortal realm; one who descends is not a righteous god'? As one of the Seven Creation Gods, the Wind God cannot descend in His true form. At least, the current situation is not enough to meet the conditions for an exception." [[7770 马修 neutral]]
"And I am currently just the bard Matthew. My true identity is merely a wisp of an avatar among a thousand winds, so the power I can control is limited. What I just did was probably my limit." [[7771 马修 neutral]]
Matthew explained, then pulled out his worn-out harp again, his fingertips strumming the strings. [[7772 旁白 neutral]]
"But didn't you just repel Cain?" [[7773 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
"It's not that simple. An Evil God's descent requires overcoming many obstacles and paying a very heavy price. Descending is not easy, and driving them back after they successfully descend is also not easy..." [[7774 马修 neutral]]
"I only temporarily forced him back. That old geezer recognized my aura and knew my identity, understanding that he wouldn't gain anything by fighting me, so he directly used his power to seal this place, and his divine consciousness went wandering off to other places." [[7775 马修 neutral]]
Saying this, Matthew simply spread his hands to express his helplessness. [[7776 旁白 neutral]]
"With the power Cain is currently demonstrating, I need to contact other avatars distributed in various places and combine our strength to solve this. But the problem lies here: although Cain's consciousness was forced away, he left behind a powerful force that sealed the sky here. My wind cannot pierce through his power's blockade, so I can't contact other avatars." [[7777 马修 neutral]]
"..." [[7778 旁白 neutral]]
The air fell silent instantly. The problem was simple and laid before everyone. [[7779 旁白 neutral]]
That old cunning Cain, realizing he couldn't gain anything by clashing head-on with a righteous god, simply sealed this place to prevent the avatars from connecting with each other and combining their strength. [[7780 旁白 neutral]]
"Lord Wind God, do you remember the locations of the other avatars? If you can give me precise locations, I can fly..." [[7781 塞莱斯特 sad]]
Celeste, anxious, quickly spoke up. [[7782 旁白 neutral]]
"No, not to mention how many avatars there are, even if you could find them all precisely, the black mist on the way would make you lose the correct direction, and there definitely wouldn't be enough time." [[7783 马修 neutral]]
Matthew's words cast a shadow of despair over the already unfavorable situation. [[7784 旁白 sad]]
Even the Wind God can't do anything, is it really... [[7785 旁白 sad]]
"However, speaking of which..." [[7786 马修 neutral]]
Matthew's gaze swept towards Rosalia, who had remained silent, and the corners of his mouth curved slightly. [[7787 旁白 neutral]]
"If I could get help from the two ladies, this situation could be resolved." [[7788 马修 neutral]]
Rosalia raised an eyebrow slightly and spoke. [[7789 旁白 neutral]]
"At a time like this, don't play coy. Anything I can help with, just say it. For both public and private reasons, I will not refuse." [[7790 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Then it's easy!" [[7791 马修 happy]]
A strange excitement gathered in Matthew's eyes; he seemed to be anticipating something. [[7792 旁白 neutral]]
"Rosalia, then I ask you to break through the mist of this sky! No matter what method you use, pierce through this black, false sky!" [[7793 马修 neutral]]
"Okay." [[7794 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Without much questioning, without a moment of hesitation, the girl nodded in agreement. The unsharpened Holy Sword appeared in her hand, shimmering with water. [[7795 旁白 neutral]]
The clear blade reflected half of the girl's face. She agreed to Matthew's request without hesitation, but how should she do it? [[7796 旁白 neutral]]
How could one pierce through a sky locked by an Evil God? [[7797 旁白 neutral]]
The perplexing question swirled in her mind, like a drop of water falling into a calm lake, stirring tiny ripples. As the ripples spread, they revealed her purest original intention. [[7798 旁白 neutral]]
"Have you thought of a way?" [[7799 塞莱斯特 sad]]
Celeste asked worriedly. [[7800 旁白 neutral]]
"No." [[7801 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"But, I've understood some things..." [[7802 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Matthew still wore a mysterious smile. Celeste was still partly confused, and Maedeya had been unable to interject from the start; the current situation seemed to imply that even she, a Fifth-Tier witch, no longer had the right to speak. [[7803 旁白 neutral]]
Under the gaze of various emotions, the girl stepped forward calmly, slowly raising the Holy Sword to her chest. Her jade forehead lightly touched the clear blade, and her eyes closed. With this, her figure became light. [[7804 旁白 neutral]]
When she opened her eyes again, her clear, innocent blue water-drop eyes. [[7805 旁白 neutral]]
"I am Rosalia, the primordial spring of life in this world, the cornerstone of peace." [[7806 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The clear words were like water droplets falling into a cold pool, carrying an undeniable sacredness and declaration. The moment the last syllable fell. [[7807 旁白 neutral]]
"Buzz—!" [[7808 旁白 neutral]]
Not an earth-shattering explosion, but a magnificent and pure hum, originating from the very essence of the world, suddenly resounded! Centered around Rosalia, an indescribable azure divine light burst forth! [[7809 旁白 neutral]]
The light was not hot like fire, but like the core of the deepest ocean, condensing infinite vitality and absolute tranquility. It did not spread, but instantly converged into a colossal pillar of light that pierced through the heavens and earth, pure, condensed, and irresistible! [[7810 旁白 neutral]]
The pillar of light shot up into the sky, carrying the supreme will of the Water God's name being called and authority being invoked, directly piercing the thick, foul black sky! [[7811 旁白 neutral]]
"Tear—!!!" [[7812 旁白 neutral]]
A teeth-gritting tearing sound sharply rang out! The sealed layer, formed by the Evil God's power and impenetrable even to a Wind God avatar, was instantly pierced through by this pure, condensed divine light pillar, like melting snow meeting fire, or rotten cloth pierced by a sharp blade! [[7813 旁白 neutral]]
Where the light pillar passed, foul black smoke furiously twisted, shrieked, and annihilated! A massive void, its edges flowing with azure divine light, conspicuously appeared in the pitch-black sky! [[7814 旁白 neutral]]
Through that forcefully torn opening, the pure color of the sky and long-lost fragments of sunlight, difficult but resolute, showered down, illuminating the shocked faces of Celeste and Maedeya below! [[7815 旁白 surprised]]
Matthew looked up at the light pillar piercing through the sky and nodded with satisfaction. [[7816 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the holy figure in mid-air, a nostalgic expression appeared in his eyes as he softly murmured. [[7817 旁白 neutral]]
"Finally, a bit... of His former divine presence." [[7818 马修 neutral]]
"So..." [[7819 旁白 neutral]]
The poet's hand patted Celeste's somewhat dazed shoulder. The latter turned around and saw the calm smile on Matthew's face. [[7820 旁白 neutral]]
"Everything is ready, all that is needed is the east wind. Now that the mist binding the wind has been pierced by pure water, it is your turn to make your appearance. Are you ready, my child?" [[7821 马修 neutral]]
"Yes." [[7822 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
The shock on the girl's face gradually faded due to these words, finally coalescing into an undeniable determination. She clenched her fist and nodded heavily. [[7823 旁白 neutral]]
Matthew's smile deepened, a mix of satisfaction and cunning. He said no more, simply nodded slightly, then his hands, which had once strummed countless ordinary melodies, gently caressed the strings of the worn harp in his arms. [[7824 旁白 neutral]]
"Zheng—Om—" [[7825 旁白 neutral]]
A simple yet exceptionally clear note, like the first stone cast into a calm lake, suddenly rang out. It wasn't earth-shattering, but it carried a peculiar penetrating power, as if it ignored the barrier of space, embodying the essence of wind—freedom and dissemination. [[7826 旁白 neutral]]
The note leaped, instantly merging into the sky void, which Rosalia had pierced and was now flowing with azure divine light. Carried by the long-lost fresh air rushing in through the opening, it rapidly spread in all directions. [[7827 旁白 neutral]]
This note was like a signal, an invisible ripple, centering on Kempfa Town, instantly sweeping across the entire Windermere Territory shrouded in black smoke. [[7828 旁白 neutral]]
In a remote corner of Creekwood Town's market, shrouded in black mist, a bard who was hugging a worn lute and trying to dispel people's fear with cheerful tunes suddenly stopped his fingers. [[7829 旁白 neutral]]
He looked up, and a trace of unbelievable clarity flashed in his clouded eyes. Then, a knowing, even mischievous smile spread across his lips. He adjusted his posture, changed his fingering, and actually began to play a melody that echoed the distant note! [[7830 旁白 neutral]]
On the ramparts of Storm Fortress, a sentinel with a harp at his waist, responsible for observation, suddenly brightened on his tired face. He ignored the demonized beasts still raging below, abruptly pulled out his harp, turned his back to the desperate battlefield, faced the direction from which the music came, and forcefully strummed the strings! [[7831 旁白 neutral]]
Beside a hidden wooden house deep in the quiet forest, at the dwarf gathering point where bonfires were lit deep in the mine, and even on the edges of the village ruins where people were huddled on the ground, groaning in pain, eroded by black smoke... figure after figure, some in rags, some covered in dust, but without exception, they were all bards of the Windermere Territory. At this moment, their instruments, no matter how worn, seemed to have been imbued with souls, and they spontaneously played the same melody! [[7832 旁白 neutral]]
At first, there were only scattered points, like fireflies in the night. Then, tens, hundreds, thousands... countless faint harp sounds, like trickling streams, rose from every corner of the Windermere Territory, converging! [[7833 旁白 neutral]]
They crossed mountains and rivers, penetrated the foul black mist, ignored the cries of despair, echoing, resonating, and layering upon each other! [[7834 旁白 neutral]]
In an instant, a grand, solemn, yet unyielding symphony of life resounded throughout the entire territory's sky! This was no longer mortal music, but the resonance of faith and freedom, the echo of the Wind's will in the mortal world! [[7835 旁白 neutral]]
"Now, Celeste!" [[7836 马修 neutral]]
Matthew's voice carried an unprecedented solemnity, his gaze burning as he looked at the Wind Saintess beside him. [[7837 旁白 neutral]]
Celeste took a deep breath, the melodious and majestic harp music seeming to ignite the flame deep within her soul. She closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, her emerald eyes sparkled like stars. [[7838 旁白 neutral]]
She straightened her slender but resilient back, clasped her hands over her chest, and began to pray like the most devout believer. [[7839 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, a clear, ethereal song, as if woven by the wind itself, flowed from her lips. [[7840 旁白 neutral]]
That was an ancient sacred song, praising the freedom of the wind, the enlightenment of wisdom, and the indomitable spirit of life in adversity! Her singing was not a solo performance, but instantly merged into the symphony of harp music that resounded throughout heaven and earth, becoming the core, the brightest melody! [[7841 旁白 neutral]]
[Holy Song • Wings of Freedom] [[7842 旁白 neutral]]
The song rode on the wind, on the wings of the harp music, precisely entering the ears of every Wind God follower, reaching the deepest parts of their hearts, which had been temporarily frozen by fear and despair! [[7843 旁白 neutral]]
"Freedom..." [[7844 旁白 neutral]]
"Flight..." [[7845 旁白 neutral]]
"Hope..." [[7846 旁白 neutral]]
Innumerable voices, innumerable thoughts, awakened and ignited in the hearts of the believers by this song! [[7847 旁白 neutral]]
The suppressed longing by the black smoke, the yearning for a clear sky, the resistance against oppression... all emotions related to "freedom" reached an unprecedented peak of resonance at this moment! [[7848 旁白 neutral]]
"Whoosh—!!!" [[7849 旁白 neutral]]
On the land of Windermere Territory, a sudden surge of change erupted from flat ground! [[7850 旁白 neutral]]
Not a natural wind, but an unprecedented spiritual wind stirred by the boiling "free will" in the hearts of billions of living beings! This wind was formless and intangible, yet irresistibly powerful! [[7851 旁白 neutral]]
It suddenly condensed beneath the feet and behind the backs of every believer, transforming into pairs of massive, hazy "Wings of Wind" composed of pure faith! [[7852 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah!" [[7853 旁白 surprised]]
A farm woman huddled in the ruins cried out in surprise. She found herself being gently lifted by a soft force, slowly rising from the cold ground. [[7854 旁白 neutral]]
"I... I can fly?" [[7855 旁白 surprised]]
The dwarf in the mine widened his eyes, awkwardly flapping the suddenly appeared azure light wings behind him, slowly ascending with a wobble. [[7856 旁白 neutral]]
The scholar put down his classics, the academic pushed up his glasses, the warrior gripped his broken weapon... regardless of gender, age, or social status, anyone who believed in the wind and yearned for freedom was now bathed in this spiritual wind, with the Wings of Wind, symbolizing free will, unfurling behind them! [[7857 旁白 neutral]]
"Fly! For freedom!" [[7858 旁白 neutral]]
Someone in the sky let out the first shout. [[7859 旁白 neutral]]
"For Windermere!" [[7860 旁白 neutral]]
"For the Wind God!" [[7861 旁白 neutral]]
The shouts converged into a torrent! [[7862 旁白 neutral]]
Thousands, no, hundreds of thousands, millions of figures, like flocks of birds breaking free from the earth's shackles, with incredible surprise and resolute courage, soared into the sky! [[7863 旁白 neutral]]
They were no longer passive ants enduring disaster, but had transformed into warriors fighting against darkness! People awkwardly or skillfully controlled their wind wings, guided by Celeste's sacred song, and amidst the echoing harp music, they spontaneously began to spiral! [[7864 旁白 neutral]]
At first, it was chaotic, but soon, a marvelous rhythm born from common faith and will emerged. The flying people, centered around the azure light pillar above Kempfa Town, began to spiral upward like an immense vortex made of life and belief! [[7865 旁白 neutral]]
Every spiraling figure was like a carving knife, invisibly cutting through the black curtain. Every pair of flapping wind wings stirred up a pure airflow that resisted the filth! [[7866 旁白 neutral]]
Millions of people circling, millions of pairs of wind wings flapping! The gathered power was a torrent capable of changing heaven and earth! The spiritual wind, infinitely amplified by the harp music and sacred song, now transformed into a tangible force that tore through the sky! [[7867 旁白 neutral]]
"Rip—Crack—!!!" [[7868 旁白 neutral]]
A chilling cracking sound, no longer localized, but reverberating throughout the entire sky of Windermere Territory! The thick, foul black sky, constructed by the residual power of Evil God Cain, was now like being cut from within by billions of invisible blades, and impacted from below by a raging hurricane! [[7869 旁白 neutral]]
Spiderweb-like cracks instantly covered the entire sky, and then, under the gaze of countless eyes filled with hope and freedom, it utterly collapsed and shattered! [[7870 旁白 neutral]]
The long-awaited, golden, incredibly warm sunlight, like a breaking dam, poured down unimpeded, instantly dispelling the chill and darkness, illuminating every inch of the liberated land! [[7871 旁白 neutral]]
That day, the wind tore through the shadow, and freedom returned to the earth. [[7872 旁白 neutral]]
P.S.: No matter what, there was indeed a problem with the pacing of the second volume. Logically, the outline for the second volume existed, so the pacing issue shouldn't have been so severe. Perhaps it was because my mindset wasn't good. When I noticed that many readers felt the pace was slow and wanted to save it for later, I panicked, which led to an even more severe collapse in pacing. This resulted in a lot of wasted effort on character portrayal, which also wasn't very good. This is my problem. Ultimately, it's because I haven't written enough and haven't accumulated enough experience. To prevent the pacing from collapsing further, I shortened many processes and directly ended the second volume with 8000 words. To be honest, I've been writing this chapter since 3 PM, and it's only 10:30 PM now that I've finally finished. I made many deletions and revisions along the way, and I was very conflicted. The latter half was almost entirely written while listening to music to set the mood, and I unconsciously used a lot of exclamation marks. But no matter what, at least I tried my best. Whether everyone is satisfied or not, at least I won't have too many regrets myself. [[7873 旁白 neutral]]
