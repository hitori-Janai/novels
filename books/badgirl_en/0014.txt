Chapter 14: You Can Go [[843 旁白 neutral]]
The girl's palm on his forehead was cool and soft. It should have been a pleasant feeling, but Selen An was too nervous to move, his back drenched in cold sweat. [[844 旁白 fearful]]
Sixty seconds. The soul inspection lasted for a full sixty seconds. To Selen An, those sixty seconds felt as long as sixty years... [[845 旁白 fearful]]
He didn't know the result of the inspection, but he was certain of one thing: he was an imposter. [[846 旁白 fearful]]
Serenia withdrew her hand. She looked down, staring at her palm for a long time before looking up again, her beautiful ice-blue eyes locking with the young man's. [[847 旁白 neutral]]
Under her stunningly beautiful gaze, it felt as if no lie could hide. Selen An tried desperately to still his pounding heart as she began to speak. [[848 旁白 fearful]]
"You..." [[849 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
His heart was in his throat. He had the strong feeling he was about to be exposed, as if his heart would burst from his chest at any moment. [[850 旁白 fearful]]
"There is no problem." [[851 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Phew... [[852 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An breathed a silent sigh of relief as the heavy stone in his heart finally lifted. [[853 旁白 neutral]]
That was close, I dodged that bullet... Wait! [[854 旁白 surprised]]
My soul has no problem? [[855 旁白 surprised]]
His heart, just put at ease, was once again on edge. What did she mean, 'no problem'? [[856 旁白 surprised]]
'No problem' was the biggest problem of all. The original owner's soul had been replaced. Although the body was the same, the contents were completely different. It was like buying a down jacket only to find it stuffed with cotton—how could that be the same?! [[857 旁白 fearful]]
Serenia had checked his soul directly. Why hadn't she noticed such an obvious problem? [[858 旁白 fearful]]
Was Serenia not skilled enough to see the truth, or had she seen it but was lying to make him lower his guard and extract more information? [[859 旁白 fearful]]
He could rule out the first possibility. Serenia had become a Saintess through her own power. Her impressive record against the Demon Clan proved she wasn't some low-rated player who got carried to victory. [[860 旁白 neutral]]
If it wasn't a mistake, then it was very likely... [[861 旁白 fearful]]
Just as Selen An was racking his brain for a counter-plan, Serenia spoke again. [[862 旁白 neutral]]
"Saving that mother and daughter... I don't know what you were really thinking. Maybe you truly regret your past and want to change, or maybe you're just putting on an act to gain my trust..." [[863 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
The look Serenia gave Selen An was incredibly complex. [[864 旁白 neutral]]
The young man sighed to himself. She was right. After all the terrible things the original Selen An had done, even the deep trust and affection from their childhood had probably been worn away by countless disappointments. [[865 旁白 sad]]
"I... Forget it!" [[866 塞伦安 sad]]
The young man, who had been struggling to find an explanation, suddenly seemed to give up and laughed bitterly. [[867 旁白 sad]]
"Just consider me a hypocrite. This is all an act to win your trust." [[868 塞伦安 sad]]
Selen An didn't blame Serenia for her distrust. After all, doing anything to survive was exactly what the real Selen An would do, right? [[869 旁白 sad]]
The night was unusually quiet, and their conversation came to a standstill once again. [[870 旁白 neutral]]
"Selen An, you should understand that the entire Craigmore wasteland is swarming with demons hunting for you. Even sneaking you away under the cover of night is already extremely dangerous. Taking two ordinary people who can't defend themselves makes it even harder." [[871 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Hearing the girl's words, Selen An's heart sank. [[872 旁白 sad]]
He didn't blame Serenia for being cold. After all, he was the one who had drawn the demons across the buffer zone, and he was the one who had put Anna and her mother in this situation. He had no right to blame anyone. Besides, what Serenia said was true. He... [[873 旁白 sad]]
Wait, why was he habitually thinking from Selen An's perspective again? [[874 旁白 surprised]]
He was a transmigrator. He should be thinking calmly about how to save himself from a bystander's point of view, not getting tangled up in the guilt from the sins of this body's original owner. [[875 旁白 surprised]]
It happened this time, and it happened when he was talking to Anna's mother. Was it because the body was influencing him? [[876 旁白 fearful]]
... [[877 旁白 neutral]]
The young man was silent. [[878 旁白 neutral]]
"I will save them." [[879 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
For some reason, hearing these words, Selen An felt a great sense of relief, as if a huge problem had been solved. [[880 旁白 happy]]
"Thank you. You are a truly respectable Saintess." [[881 塞伦安 happy]]
"No, I'm not just saving them because it's my duty as a Saintess, but also..." [[882 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
As Serenia spoke, she gave the young man a deep look with her ice-blue eyes. [[883 旁白 neutral]]
"Because someone reached out to me when I was at my most desperate." [[884 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Her voice was filled with complex emotions, but before Selen An could process it, her tone turned cold again. [[885 旁白 neutral]]
"Hold out your hands." [[886 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
The girl's voice was cold, like a judge with no personal feelings. [[887 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An obediently held out his hands. The girl's fingertips touched his wrists again, a chilling sensation spreading through his body. [[888 旁白 fearful]]
Was he going to be put in ice cuffs and have his freedom restricted again? [[889 旁白 fearful]]
But maybe that was for the best. Being cuffed meant he was a prisoner, and Serenia wouldn't kill him for now. When they returned to his family, she would surely help him deal with the Succubus Seed in his body before deciding his punishment. [[890 旁白 neutral]]
As long as he wasn't executed immediately, there was room to maneuver... [[891 旁白 neutral]]
His hands were cuffed again by the ice shackles, and the coldness gathered in his abdomen slowly faded. Selen An shivered and looked toward the nearby wooden cabin. [[892 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the cabin were a mother, her daughter, and a new life about to be born. His actions might not wash away all his sins, but for him, the transmigrator, he had a clear conscience. [[893 旁白 neutral]]
With this thought, his gaze toward the cabin softened, and the smile on his face became more relaxed and pure. [[894 旁白 happy]]
Serenia stared at the young man's relieved smile in profile, momentarily stunned. [[895 旁白 surprised]]
How long had it been since she had seen such a pure smile on his face? [[896 旁白 sad]]
Perhaps it started when she was announced as the next Saintess. From then on, the hero in her heart slowly degenerated into an ignorant, selfish, profligate scion. [[897 旁白 sad]]
But was that really the truth? [[898 旁白 surprised]]
If he were a completely selfish person, why would he be so insistent on saving the mother and daughter? [[899 旁白 surprised]]
Was it out of guilt? [[900 旁白 surprised]]
Maybe not entirely. Because of the mark she had left on Selen An, she had overheard his entire conversation with Anna's mother. As a hidden observer, it was the first time in their years of estrangement that she had felt his inner world through his words. [[901 旁白 neutral]]
His repeated apologies sounded so much like his old self. He had emptied his pockets of all his money. Perhaps it was guilt, or perhaps it was the kindness in his soul that seemed buried but had never truly disappeared... [[902 旁白 sad]]
Selen An had made many, many mistakes. Anyone in the world could kill him and be praised for it, but not her. Only she could not. [[903 旁白 sad]]
Even if his remorse was an act, even if his change of heart was a performance, even if there was only the slightest possibility, she had to try to believe... [[904 旁白 sad]]
Just as Selen An was looking at the cabin, waiting for Serenia's next move, he heard a crisp cracking sound. [[905 旁白 surprised]]
He looked down at his wrists, which should have been locked, only to find in astonishment that the ice cuffs restricting his hands were now covered in cracks. A moment later, they shattered into countless ice shards and fell to the ground. [[906 旁白 surprised]]
"This..." [[907 塞伦安 surprised]]
Before Selen An's brain could process what had just happened, the girl's cold voice echoed beside his ear. [[908 旁白 neutral]]
"You can go." [[909 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
