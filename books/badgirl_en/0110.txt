Chapter 110: Name [[6468 旁白 neutral]]
    “Lobelia...” [[6469 旁白 neutral]]
    This time, she didn't refuse, answering faintly. [[6470 旁白 neutral]]
    The girl's voice was as indifferent as still, dead water. Cayetana found it difficult to sense any human emotion or warmth from her tear-drop eyes. [[6471 旁白 neutral]]
    An absolute "rationality," or to put it another way, a feeling close to that of a god. [[6472 旁白 neutral]]
    In terms of demeanor and feeling, she was infinitely close to the great beings Cayetana had witnessed firsthand in the mythical era. Mortals seeing such a divine miracle would likely have long knelt in prayer, not daring to look directly at the true face of a god. [[6473 旁白 neutral]]
    But she didn't. Looking directly into the girl's tear-drop eyes, the light in Cayetana's eyes went from shining with surprise at first, to flickering with doubt in the middle, and finally dimming completely with disappointment... [[6474 旁白 sad]]
    Although her divinity was abundant, at such a close distance, she was almost certain her previous conjecture was correct. However, unfortunately, the girl, as a "descent vessel," had a huge flaw— [[6475 旁白 neutral]]
    Her body contained only one soul, a soul that was neither special nor powerful, but perfectly matched the soul strength a Fifth-Order Saint Mark Sorcerer should possess. Her previous divine manifestations were merely due to a large amount of divine power being temporarily infused into her body... [[6476 旁白 neutral]]
    In other words, this generation's Water Saintess was not a true descent vessel. The Water God did not descend a part of their will into this body; they merely projected a portion of their power into the mortal world. [[6477 旁白 neutral]]
    Obtaining divine power was not difficult for a Saintess. Ordinary extraordinary beings would need to reach at least the Sixth Order to touch divinity, but Saintesses were an exception because they were inherently the代理 of gods, a group of the most special individuals. [[6478 旁白 neutral]]
    Cayetana had seen gods with her own eyes, and naturally, had also confronted true Saintesses. A Saintess invoking divinity was not special; the one before her merely invoked a bit more divinity than other normal Saintesses... [[6479 旁白 neutral]]
    Therefore, this time, her judgment was flawed. [[6480 旁白 neutral]]
    The other party's connection to the Water God was insufficient, so she naturally could not meet the god through this method. [[6481 旁白 neutral]]
    Indeed, was this probability still too small? [[6482 旁白 neutral]]
    However, since she chose to gamble, she was also prepared to face the cost of failure. [[6483 旁白 neutral]]
    This was fine. Anyway, she had lived long enough, so long that she herself felt weary. This awakening, for her, was merely a transition from one cage to becoming a pawn in the hands of her own kind. [[6484 旁白 neutral]]
    The Vampire Duke who personally unsealed her had tampered with her body. Cayetana was all too familiar with such betrayal and exploitation. After all, this was the true face of the Demon Clan, wasn't it? [[6485 旁白 neutral]]
    It was so a thousand years ago, and it was so a thousand years later. [[6486 旁白 neutral]]
    “In the end, it was all for nothing...” [[6487 旁白 sad]]
    The Vampire girl's voice carried deep regret, but this emotion was fleeting. [[6488 旁白 neutral]]
    As a "beautiful girl" who had lived for a thousand years, what kind of situations hadn't she seen? [[6489 旁白 neutral]]
    The emotion of "regret" had long been almost discarded during her long years after being embraced by the Second Progenitor. For Vampires with nearly infinite lifespans, regret and remorse were very rare emotions. [[6490 旁白 neutral]]
    Whether it was mistakes you made, past enemies, or missed opportunities, most things that could cause you actual harm would completely lose their meaning as time passed. [[6491 旁白 neutral]]
    Being alive was the greatest reliance of Vampires, but everything had its pros and cons. Vampires who lived too long often lost the meaning of life, and their twisted and worn-down mentality made them more inclined to do things for amusement. [[6492 旁白 neutral]]
    So, after a slight regret, the Vampire girl, "not far from death," revealed a joyful smile on her lips again. [[6493 旁白 happy]]
    “Lobelia, you really dare to say that~” [[6494 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    “Trying to scare me off, you, the Water God's most devout believer, didn't hesitate to violate doctrine, not only calling out the deity's true name but even using it to deceive and swindle!” [[6495 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
    “Little girl, don't you know that doing so will incur divine punishment?” [[6496 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
    Cayetana spoke each word, each one cold and biting, as if to nail the girl to a bronze pillar of blasphemous judgment with this evidence of her crime. [[6497 旁白 angry]]
    She watched the girl's nearly flawless face with amusement, patiently waiting to savor the purest fear and panic from that pure and lovely face. [[6498 旁白 neutral]]
    But reality disappointed her; she underestimated the influence of divine power and missed the focus of the Water Saintess's attention. [[6499 旁白 sad]]
    “Vampire lady, you're dying.” [[6500 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Lobelia spoke mechanically, expressionless, as if she had entered an automated mode. [[6501 旁白 neutral]]
    “Tsk... you don't need to say such nonsense!” [[6502 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
    Cayetana snorted coldly and turned her head away. [[6503 旁白 neutral]]
    “Instead of threatening me with so-called death here, you should worry about your own situation. What I just said wasn't alarmist; as a Saintess, you should be clearest about the consequences of blasphemy...” [[6504 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
    “And I have no reason to lie to a little girl like you. I thoroughly understand the rigid and stubborn personalities of you clergy. I will die, but you won't get to live either!” [[6505 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
    “To be able to take a Saintess with me before I die, I have no regrets. So, repent for your lies, foolish one...” [[6506 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
    “Saintesses never lie, at least, I don't.” [[6507 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The sudden remark interrupted Cayetana's somewhat "mad" speech. The silver-haired Vampire girl's body trembled; as if realizing something, she didn't even bother to hide her stiff expression, lunging forward and tightly grabbing the girl's shoulders, staring at her from extremely close proximity. [[6508 旁白 surprised]]
    During this process, Lobelia offered no resistance. [[6509 旁白 neutral]]
    “Impossible...” [[6510 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
    A tremor. The arrogant Blood Noble's voice held an imperceptible tremble for the first time. [[6511 旁白 surprised]]
    Although Cayetana kept repeating "impossible," her inner turmoil grew stronger, because she could not see a single flaw in the girl's eyes... her azure eyes were as pure as the clearest water in this world, showing neither sorrow nor joy, nor anger nor confusion. [[6512 旁白 neutral]]
    She wasn't lying. Cayetana, despite her best efforts, could only come to this conclusion. [[6513 旁白 neutral]]
    “Who on earth gave you this name?! Are your parents mad? How dare they use a true god's name to...” [[6514 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
    “My father is missing, and my mother has passed away. Besides, this name wasn't given to me by them.” [[6515 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    A few strands of Lobelia's hair near her temples were disheveled from Cayetana's forceful shaking, but her tone remained largely unchanged. [[6516 旁白 neutral]]
    “Who is it? Who! Who on earth would dare to...” [[6517 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
    “Sabella.” [[6518 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    “...” [[6519 旁白 neutral]]
    The moment those three words appeared, the entire space fell silent. Cayetana, whose thoughts were already somewhat chaotic, descended completely into confusion. Even the hands that had been shaking the girl's body stopped exerting force, and she stood frozen in place, motionless. [[6520 旁白 surprised]]
    After a long time, she finally asked tremblingly, her voice a little hoarse. [[6521 旁白 neutral]]
    “Who...” [[6522 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
    “The First Water Saintess, Sabella.” [[6523 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    In this state, the girl seemed to have become an answering machine, even considerately adding a prefix in case Cayetana didn't recognize the name. [[6524 旁白 neutral]]
