Chapter 100: "Betrayal" (5000) [[5716 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella was ready to die. [[5717 旁白 neutral]]
    In despair, a holy nun would never surrender, only sacrifice! [[5718 旁白 neutral]]
    The black spear was about to pierce her body. She instinctively closed her eyes, ready to face the long pain and torment that was coming, but... [[5719 旁白 fearful]]
    The imagined pain did not come, but in her ear, she seemed to hear a voice that was incredibly familiar to her. [[5720 旁白 surprised]]
    No, that's not right, how could the owner of that voice appear here? [[5721 旁白 surprised]]
    Wait, they entered the cellar on Saturday night. So much has happened and so much time has passed since then. That means it's Sunday now... [[5722 旁白 neutral]]
    Sunday, Evelyn, no, no, don't involve her too! [[5723 旁白 fearful]]
    "No fighting." [[5724 旁白 neutral]]
    That clear and concise statement, though without much emotional fluctuation, seemed to contain a unique power. [[5725 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella opened her eyes and saw the thick black spear stop before her forearm. A fair, jade-like hand firmly grasped it, preventing its advance, a short distance from the spear's tip. [[5726 旁白 surprised]]
    "Who... are you?" [[5727 旁白 neutral]]
    Suddenly being rescued in a desperate situation that was pushing her to collapse, Isabella couldn't suppress the soreness in her eyes, and clear tears rolled down her cheeks. [[5728 旁白 sad]]
    This back was incredibly familiar, but this attire was something she had never seen before—a thorny crown, white lace gloves, a soft, water-like swallowtail dress outlining the girl's graceful feminine curves, and calves in high heels forming an amazing arc. The most striking feature was the strand of sea-blue long hair falling softly from her hair, elegant beyond words. [[5729 旁白 neutral]]
    "Sorry, due to some irresistible reasons, I'm late." [[5730 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    It, it was a familiar voice, the voice of her younger sister Evelyn from her memories! [[5731 旁白 surprised]]
    Isabella's eyes widened slightly, and her heart pounded. [[5732 旁白 surprised]]
    Familiar, yet somewhat different. Although the voice was the same, her sister Evelyn's tone had a gentle and playful air, like a girl next door. Before her, this sudden savior, with the same voice, could convey a completely different... indifference, or perhaps, a divine and sacred feeling. [[5733 旁白 neutral]]
    "Damn it! What's going on?!" [[5734 蔷薇伯爵 angry]]
    From his words, it was clear that the previously arrogant Rose Duke was now somewhat panicked. He exerted force on his arm, desperately trying to push the black spear forward, but his body wouldn't obey him; it even instinctively resisted his actions. [[5735 旁白 fearful]]
    Any intelligent creature would panic when their body wouldn't listen to them, and the Rose Duke was no exception. However, his long life and energy prevented him from losing his mind instantly. [[5736 旁白 neutral]]
    Lobelia ignored the "busy" Rose Duke and turned to meet Isabella's gaze. [[5737 旁白 neutral]]
    "You, you are... Evelyn..." [[5738 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
    Her golden-brown pupils suddenly dilated. After she truly saw that face, Isabella's mind went blank. She instinctively called out that name, her voice trembling uncontrollably. [[5739 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
    She never dreamed that her sweet, soft, and universally beloved sister Evelyn would one day appear before her in such a form. [[5740 旁白 surprised]]
    This feeling was truly unique. Until now, she had only experienced it twice in her life; the first time was when she was a child in the orphanage, encountering Her Highness the Saintess. [[5741 旁白 neutral]]
    That feeling was so similar. Just perceiving their existence and feeling her mind, even her soul, being purified was a kind of holiness and divinity that couldn't be imitated or replicated. [[5742 旁白 neutral]]
    Saintess... It's a Saintess, Sister Evelyn is a Saintess just like Miss! [[5743 旁白 surprised]]
    Suddenly, a bold, even blasphemous thought, exploded in her mind. She subconsciously felt that a girl who had never been publicly canonized by the Church was a Saintess! [[5744 旁白 surprised]]
    "Hmm, Evelyn is indeed one of the names I use while walking in the mortal world, but my real name is—excuse me, I'll deal with a small problem first." [[5745 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Lobelia had wanted to explain her identity kindly, in a gentle tone, trying not to scare the holy nun. [[5746 旁白 neutral]]
    Anyway, her power was already exposed, so hiding it further didn't make much sense. In fact, lying with open eyes in front of her familiar friend was something Lobelia couldn't do. [[5747 旁白 neutral]]
    Meaningless deception would only increase harm and estrangement. [[5748 旁白 neutral]]
    Since she had revealed her abilities as the Water Saintess, there was no need to hide it anymore, because it simply couldn't be hidden. [[5749 旁白 neutral]]
    Lobelia herself was already prepared to confess. Anyway, the [Will to Not Fight] had already unfolded. Even if she stood still and let the fourth-order Blood Kin Count attack her for a day, she wouldn't suffer any actual harm. [[5750 旁白 neutral]]
    But in fact, these cunning fellows were not fools. Sensing something was wrong, they tried to escape like scattered rats. [[5751 旁白 neutral]]
    As the influence of [Will to Not Fight] deepened, the Rose Duke found that not only was his body uncontrollable, but his spirit also began to be restrained by some invisible force, and his killing intent was constantly suppressed. [[5752 旁白 fearful]]
    This is too damn weird! [[5753 蔷薇伯爵 angry]]
    The Rose Duke swore that he had never encountered such a bizarre ability in his life. The enemy's ability was extremely unsolvable, and the aura emanating from her was also standard fifth-order. How could an old fourth-order fight a fifth-order? [[5754 蔷薇伯爵 angry]]
    Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, running away is the best policy! [[5755 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    If he couldn't win, at least he could run, right? [[5756 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    Bah! He wasn't running away; this was a strategic retreat! [[5757 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    The life-loving Rose Duke had intended to seize the opportunity provided by the sudden appearance of the strange girl and Isabella's conversation to escape. The opponent had turned her back, giving him a chance; only a fool wouldn't run now. [[5758 旁白 neutral]]
    But clearly, things were not as simple as he imagined. [[5759 旁白 neutral]]
    Because the pervasive water had blocked all escape routes. Where did the water come from? The alarmed and uncertain Rose Duke found that the water in the pool, which was originally considered part of the seal, had now been completely drained! [[5760 旁白 surprised]]
    Also, the air was already humid with dense water elements. [[5761 旁白 fearful]]
    Damn it, the opponent is skilled in water magic, and this environment is perfect for a water mage to fight in. The opponent not only has overwhelming power and rank, but also has an environmental advantage. [[5762 旁白 fearful]]
    In an instant, the Rose Duke's heart sank to rock bottom. [[5763 旁白 fearful]]
    He had never seen such terrifying water element affinity before. To be able to unify all elements in the area without expanding a domain, such talent could only be achieved by a Saintess corresponding to that element, right? [[5764 旁白 surprised]]
    His mind raced with wild thoughts, and fear forced him to make an immediate decision. [[5765 旁白 fearful]]
    Let the cost be high, at least he had to save his life. [[5766 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    He didn't even turn his head to look at the expressions and movements of the two behind him. Without any hesitation, a trace of regret and ruthlessness flashed across the face of the Blood Kin standing there, and then... [[5767 旁白 neutral]]
    He self-destructed... [[5768 旁白 neutral]]
    Unlike Kogsa's self-destruction earlier, which caused a catastrophic commotion, the Rose Duke's self-destruction was more like blowing up his own flesh. As bones and flesh flew everywhere, a blood containing a strange light detached from his body and turned into mist, attempting to escape. [[5769 旁白 neutral]]
    The Blood Kin, known as eternally immortal, had unparalleled research in escaping and preserving their lives among the Demon Clan. This technique of the Rose Duke, similar to "golden cicada shedding its shell," was to abandon his physical body and take away as much vital blood fused with his spirit as possible to escape. [[5770 旁白 neutral]]
    Although this also incurred great losses, enough to make a fourth-order count feel pain, it could at least preserve a portion of his vital blood and his life... [[5771 旁白 neutral]]
    The Rose Duke thought so, but soon, he found that things were not developing as he imagined. [[5772 旁白 fearful]]
    The water did block the retreat, but blood could merge into the water and use it as a medium to escape. A normal water mage, no matter how strong, could only control pure water or water elements, but this time, what he encountered seemed unusual... [[5773 旁白 fearful]]
    Damn it, who can explain this to him? [[5774 蔷薇伯爵 angry]]
    Why can this suddenly appearing female mage even control blood? [[5775 旁白 surprised]]
    The blood merged into the water was uncontrollably extracted and separated. The vital blood fused with his spirit was forced to gather into a blood sphere, and this blood sphere was floating towards the hands of the mysterious blue-haired woman. [[5776 旁白 fearful]]
    No, he can't go there! [[5777 蔷薇伯爵 fearful]]
    This act of a lamb entering a tiger's mouth scared the Rose Duke out of his wits, although he didn't have guts right now. He wanted to let out a heartbroken roar, but his body was gone, and the vessel carrying his spirit was just a blood sphere. [[5778 旁白 fearful]]
    Just like that, when the blood sphere obediently fell into the blue-haired girl's open palm, the Rose Duke completely gave up hope. [[5779 旁白 sad]]
    Lobelia looked down at the blood mass, which was completely still, and a faint smile curved her lips. [[5780 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Heh, he caused trouble and then wanted to run? Did he really think she, the Water Saintess, was just a decoration? [[5781 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
    She can only control water, but bloody water is also water, kid! [[5782 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
    In a sense, the Water Saintess's absolute control over water elements was indeed a natural counter to the Blood Kin, who regarded blood as life. [[5783 旁白 neutral]]
    The fourth-order Rose Duke was taken down effortlessly. [[5784 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella on the side was stunned. The Rose Duke, who had turned their original plan upside down, was now subdued without a fight? [[5785 旁白 surprised]]
    For a moment, she had a strong sense of unreality. [[5786 旁白 neutral]]
    Compared to other demons, the Blood Kin might not be the strongest, but they were definitely one of the most troublesome and difficult to kill. Facing high-ranking Blood Kin, even with restraining attributes like mithril and holy water, they were still hard to kill. [[5787 旁白 neutral]]
    Therefore, the method for dealing with high-ranking Blood Kin was often sealing, not killing. [[5788 旁白 neutral]]
    And Evelyn, before her eyes, had effortlessly played with the opponent in the palm of her hand? [[5789 旁白 surprised]]
    No, that special radiance she emitted when she cast magic was the same as Miss's! [[5790 旁白 surprised]]
    In an instant, Isabella held her breath. What kind of shocking secret had she discovered?! [[5791 旁白 surprised]]
    Her sister Evelyn, with whom she had spent day and night, was actually a Saintess! [[5792 旁白 surprised]]
    Lobelia didn't pay much attention to Isabella's emotional fluctuations behind her, but instead gazed with interest at the completely still blood mass in her hand. [[5793 旁白 neutral]]
    "Noble Count, why aren't you speaking? Don't you like to talk? Or can't you talk?" [[5794 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The blood mass trembled, rippled with humiliation, and then exploded again. [[5795 旁白 neutral]]
    The surrounding water elements automatically protected her body, preventing a single drop of blood from staining Lobelia's body and dress, but the Rose Duke had truly gone all out this time. [[5796 旁白 neutral]]
    "Completely abandoning a body and most of the soul, relying on a backup body and the power of the blood pool for passive rebirth?" [[5797 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Although it was her first time seeing it, Lobelia seemed very familiar with the methods of these guys. [[5798 旁白 neutral]]
    Forget it. After a fourth-order vampire dies once, even if they can be passively resurrected, it's no different from being crippled. Moreover, she had already locked onto his blood. As long as this Rose Duke dared to appear before her again, she could instantly kill him the moment he showed his face. [[5799 旁白 neutral]]
    After doing all this, Lobelia finally had time to turn around and continue her unfinished conversation with Isabella. [[5800 旁白 neutral]]
    As she turned, Isabella had already struggled to stand up by leaning against the corner. Seeing the girl turn and smile at her, Isabella was first stunned, then a bitter smile appeared on her lips. [[5801 旁白 neutral]]
    "I never thought that the girl I always wanted to take away would actually be a Saintess." [[5802 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
    "Sorry, I didn't mean to hide it." [[5803 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    The blue-haired girl lowered her eyes apologetically. [[5804 旁白 neutral]]
    "No, you are my savior, and also the current Saintess. How could I possibly..." [[5805 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    The gray-haired nun's voice stopped abruptly. She widened her eyes in surprise, feeling a finger against her lips. It was Lobelia's finger. [[5806 旁白 surprised]]
    "Isabella, we are friends, aren't we?" [[5807 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Facing the girl's sincere gaze, Isabella couldn't shake her head or deny it. [[5808 旁白 neutral]]
    "...Yes." [[5809 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Since we are friends, there's no need for that identity stuff. I don't like it." [[5810 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Okay." [[5811 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    The girl's pure, water-drop eyes subconsciously calmed Isabella's mind, smoothing out the lingering excited emotions from before. She nodded, looked at the chaotic battlefield around them, and immediately knelt on one knee. [[5812 旁白 neutral]]
    "Evelyn, regardless of your identity, I beg you now to save our Lady. I believe you know everything that just happened, so I implore you..." [[5813 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
    "Are you trying to talk about the betrayal that just happened?" [[5814 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Isabella's pleading words were not finished when the gentle Lobelia interrupted her, which was unexpected. [[5815 旁白 surprised]]
    Isabella looked up in astonishment and met the blue-haired girl's smiling eyes, which were gentle to the extreme. [[5816 旁白 surprised]]
    "Isabella, are you still unwilling to fully believe my identity?" [[5817 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "No, I..." [[5818 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Isabella, actually, there was no so-called betrayal here from the very beginning, was there?" [[5819 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The dim cellar seemed to be illuminated by the water's glow, and under the cerulean light, the girl smiled and uttered such explosive words, momentarily stunning Isabella. [[5820 旁白 surprised]]
    How could that be? [[5821 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
    Lobelia looked at Isabella's completely dumbfounded expression, not surprised at all. [[5822 旁白 neutral]]
    She had said before that she was late due to some irresistible factors, which was absolutely not an excuse. If these words came from Andre's mouth, it might be a lie, but they came from Lobelia's mouth. [[5823 旁白 neutral]]
    Previously, due to the uncontrolled storm power, she was directly embedded in the wall. The short-term serious injury almost made Andre faint on the spot. Originally, he was prepared to activate [Divine Blood Awakening] with his last shred of will, but unexpectedly, his divine blood had already automatically boiled due to the severe injury to his body, activating a protection mechanism. [[5824 旁白 neutral]]
    Then her consciousness was forced back into that mysterious space. In the dreamlike holy church, she once again saw the first Water Saintess, Shabella, and received crucial advice from her. [[5825 旁白 neutral]]
    She clearly remembered her conversation with Shabella. [[5826 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[5827 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[5828 旁白 neutral]]
    "Why am I here again?" [[5829 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Because of destiny, my child." [[5830 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "...Okay, I don't have time to chat with you about destiny, which is such a mysterious thing. Let me leave quickly; I'm needed outside now." [[5831 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Don't rush, my child. I can understand your urgency and will not hinder your actions, but before that, allow me to give you a couple of pointers." [[5832 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "I'm listening intently." [[5833 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "My child, what do you think of this betrayal from the lineage of the Wind Saintess?" [[5834 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "I don't think this is a betrayal." [[5835 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Reason?" [[5836 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Intuition, and a few small details." [[5837 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "As expected of you, to be able to get the correct answer just by sensing destiny." [[5838 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Let's skip the flattery. What do you want to tell me?" [[5839 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Of course, destiny has reached a critical point. Your appearance will change everything, and now I will give you three keys to unlock the truth of destiny." [[5840 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "First, just as the Mother Goddess holds the authority of life and peace, the symbol of the deity is also the materialization of their authority. The Wind God symbolizes freedom and wisdom, and their descendants who flow with divine blood naturally inherit a part of their power..." [[5841 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "The authority of freedom grants the Wind Saintess a free soul, and the authority of wisdom grants the Wind Saintess the ability to perceive weaknesses and see through the essence of all things, so she will never be deceived." [[5842 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Second, humanity's means of observing destiny rely on abilities like prophecy and astrology, and the emergence of these abilities is closely related to the Wind God. As for scholarly pursuits like prophecy and astrology, witches inherently possess such talent. Legend has it that the Wind God's眷属 (subordinates/dependents) include not only the Skywing race but also witches." [[5843 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Third, true gods do not descend to the mortal world; those who descend are not true gods. What true gods leave in the mortal world are all avatars, and among them, there is only one exception." [[5844 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    ps: To avoid holding up your reading, I've released tomorrow's update early. I read the comments section every day, and I just want to say here that I haven't been 'padding' the content during this period. Many parts you might think are padding are actually setting up foreshadowing. If you find these foreshadows, you'll discover that the real plot is not developing as it appears on the surface. After all, I've been writing for a few years now, and the plot can't be that simple. I know many readers like to see protagonists shouting about bonds and friendship, then charging forward to defeat their enemies. This kind of plot can indeed be exciting, but it becomes boring if done too much, and you'll feel it's an old trope. So, I'm also trying to change, writing a plot with more twists and turns. The advantage is that it can elevate the story, but the disadvantage is that many readers, seeing the early setup, will say that the character design is ruined or the plot has collapsed, and this voice grows louder, leading many to abandon the story before seeing the later parts. This is what I least want to see. Therefore, this chapter's update is a last resort, more like an early confession of the plot's core and an explanation. Every character in the story is not simple, and they all have their roles to play. I hope everyone can be more patient and give me some time and opportunity. [[5845 旁白 neutral]]
