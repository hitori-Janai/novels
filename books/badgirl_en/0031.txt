The gentle saintess extended her hands to the confused child, embracing him. [[1788 旁白 neutral]]
The expected sobbing did not happen. Shabella's voice and embrace were as warm as a spring stream, but Selen An, who was receiving this honor, kept his lips tightly sealed. The corners of his eyes were red, but not a single tear fell. [[1789 旁白 sad]]
After a long while, Shabella released her embrace. She looked at the awkward and stubborn young man before her, the gentleness in her eyes not diminishing in the slightest. [[1790 旁白 neutral]]
"Why do you still suppress yourself? You should be able to feel that I mean you no harm. This place is not reality; you can release all the emotions you've buried in your heart, instead of being like this..." [[1791 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"Because I don't think I'm worthy." [[1792 塞伦安 sad]]
Selen An suddenly interrupted. [[1793 旁白 neutral]]
"I don't think I'm the one who should be crying. At least in this world, there are many families broken because of me, many people who have shed tears of despair because of me..." [[1794 塞伦安 sad]]
"Those innocent people are not at fault, I am. They suffered this world's evil because of me, yet under the heavy pressure of life, they don't even dare to cry." [[1795 塞伦安 sad]]
He raised his hand and looked at his palm. His five pale fingers were as slender as those of a noble girl who had never done manual labor. At the same time, the image of Anna's rough, calloused hands, worn from a life of hard work, appeared before his eyes. [[1796 旁白 sad]]
"Because I didn't dare. In the face of power and wealth, I didn't even dare to hold much resentment, even if they killed my husband..." [[1797 塞伦安 sad]]
The lady's words echoed in his ears once more. [[1798 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps at the beginning, when he didn't understand the situation, he could have listened to the lady's tragic past as if it were just a story, justifying it by ignoring his own actions. Although there was guilt in his heart, it was more a feeling of sympathy and pity. [[1799 旁白 sad]]
But once he learned the truth, an overwhelming sense of guilt, so strong it could not be greater, almost swallowed him whole. [[1800 旁白 fearful]]
And Anna and her mother were just a small example among the vast number of people he had harmed. When he thought of the many sins he had committed, and the numb expressions of the victims in their suffering, what right did he have to cry? [[1801 旁白 sad]]
If he were to cry grievously in Shabella's arms, it would be nothing more than crocodile tears... [[1802 旁白 sad]]
... [[1803 旁白 neutral]]
Shabella still watched him quietly, but the smile on her face faded. A tranquility that came with age settled in the sacred church, where time itself seemed to have stopped. [[1804 旁白 neutral]]
"Indeed, these are all sins you committed with your own hands. I am glad you can recognize this." [[1805 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"So death is the end I deserve. If my death can atone for even a small part of my sins, then I will have died for a worthy cause." [[1806 塞伦安 sad]]
With that, he turned and looked up again at the statue in the church. The faceless goddess opened her arms, spreading her love to the world, wishing for all life to live happily in a world of peace. [[1807 旁白 neutral]]
His emotions churned like waves. A descendant of the goddess of peace and life had turned a butcher's knife on the people he was supposed to protect. Perhaps the taint of the Succubus Seed wasn't even necessary; his very existence was a stain and shame on the name of the Water Saintess. [[1808 旁白 sad]]
"So you think death is your best choice?" [[1809 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
Shabella walked to his side, also looking up at the statue bathed in holy light. [[1810 旁白 neutral]]
"Isn't it?" [[1811 塞伦安 sad]]
Selen An's voice was filled with a deep weariness. He slowly closed his eyes, unwilling to gaze upon this purely good goddess, for her light was too dazzling, making a rat like him, from the gutters, feel there was nowhere to hide. [[1812 旁白 sad]]
The tide of his sins crushed him, leaving him unable to breathe. The gentleness and kindness Anna and her mother had shown him before he knew the truth now made him despise his own existence even more. [[1813 旁白 sad]]
How could someone like him deserve the kindness of his victims? [[1814 塞伦安 sad]]
He was simply... unworthy of the Winterlein name. [[1815 旁白 sad]]
"No." [[1816 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
Her voice suddenly lost its gentleness, becoming as clear as a mountain spring. [[1817 旁白 neutral]]
"Death is not a choice. It is a coward's escape." [[1818 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
She declared. [[1819 旁白 neutral]]
"Fate has let you experience two cycles, and now, the thread of your destiny has returned to this most crucial node. If the great power of fate brought you back only to watch this thread destroy itself, then this will be the most failed choice of your life..." [[1820 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"Such a choice is far more absurd than all the sins and mistakes you have committed before combined." [[1821 莎蓓拉 angry]]
The blue-haired mermaid girl suddenly reached out and gently held the young man's face, forcing him to meet her gaze. When their identical sapphire-blue eyes met, Selen An felt his soul being bathed in sunlight, cleansed by holy water. [[1822 旁白 surprised]]
The crushing weight of his sins, which had left him breathless, did not disappear, but it felt as if half its weight was now shared by the person before him. She healed the self-blaming scars on his heart with a patient and gentle gaze. [[1823 旁白 sad]]
The purest kindness, the purest love, the purest tolerance and maternal instinct were all perfectly displayed in that moment. [[1824 旁白 happy]]
Is this the Water Saintess... the legendary, perfectly good and pure saintess? Just by meeting her gaze, the darkness buried in his heart was no longer suppressed. Darkness was still darkness, but in the sunlight, it was merely the shadow that every living being has behind them. [[1825 旁白 surprised]]
"What else can I do?" [[1826 塞伦安 fearful]]
He was like a lost lamb, not knowing the path ahead, not knowing what salvation was. [[1827 旁白 fearful]]
Unconsciously, he tightly gripped the hem of the girl's skirt, as if holding onto a life-saving straw. [[1828 旁白 fearful]]
"Death is the end of the road, but your mission is not over." [[1829 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"Do not be sad, do not grieve. I am not asking you to forget the sins you have committed. But to walk towards self-destruction out of fear of facing your sins is the choice of a coward. You are a child of the Winterlein family, the one who carries the will of that great mother goddess!" [[1830 莎蓓拉 angry]]
"Listen to me, my child. The mistakes a person makes can only be repaid by themselves. You talk about dying to atone for your sins, but can the lives of those you persecuted truly be repaid with just one life?" [[1831 莎蓓拉 angry]]
"If you truly want to atone, then live on. Recognizing your mistakes is a good thing, but only those who are still alive in this moment can correct them." [[1832 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
Shabella's words were like an icebreaker cutting through the frozen river of the underworld. Amidst the crisp sound of cracking ice, Selen An suddenly saw a spark ignite in the eyes of the self cowering in the depths of his soul—that faint light resembled the flickering flame under the pot where Anna brewed herbs for him when he awoke from his pain. [[1833 旁白 surprised]]
The girl's call also reappeared. Beneath the desperate paleness, she shouted his name, her voice traveling along the thread of fate to reach him here. [[1834 旁白 surprised]]
The moment his stubborn thinking was broken, the tears that had been suppressed instantly streamed down his cheeks from the corners of his eyes. The tears wet the back of his hand, and his eyes, like those of a child waking from a dream, regained their childhood brightness and clarity. [[1835 旁白 sad]]
"I... I..." [[1836 塞伦安 sad]]
"The shackles of your bloodline have been broken. Your future path has been extended once more. Now, the time to return has come. In the land of the living, an ice lotus about to fall into eternal sleep needs you to pour the spring of life into it." [[1837 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"But, but I've already degenerated into a succubus. I can never go back. Do I really still have the right to represent the Winterleins? Do I really still have the right to touch her?" [[1838 塞伦安 fearful]]
The young man's eyes were once again clouded with a confused white mist. [[1839 旁白 sad]]
"Child, do not be afraid. Water embraces all things. As long as you still hold a heart of mercy to save the suffering, the Mother Goddess's embrace will always be open to you." [[1840 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"Come, open your heart and mind. The power of your bloodline will change you back to the form you should have. You will walk the world in that form, to atone for your sins, to complete your mission..." [[1841 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
"And I will be here, watching over you forever." [[1842 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
A voice that nourished all things, a murmur as gentle as water. [[1843 旁白 neutral]]
The holy and flawless mermaid girl opened her arms to him. His body instinctively could not refuse this gesture. A water-like care enveloped him from all directions. In a daze, behind the girl, the faceless statue in the church burst forth with a thousand rays of light. It seemed to come alive. The divine radiance from it was clearly brighter than any light, yet it did not feel piercing to the eyes. [[1844 旁白 surprised]]
Sacred six wings, like the hands of a god, embraced the two of them from both sides. It still stood there, watching this descendant who, under the protection of the bloodline, had inherited the mission. [[1845 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, my child, you will walk the earth with a new identity, and look up at the starry sky with a new name. Lobelia Winterlein, please, with your hands, your voice, your blood, spread the light of the saintess to every corner of this world." [[1846 莎蓓拉 happy]]
His consciousness sank into a boundless expanse of white light. It was a comfort and warmth he could not refuse, like a mother's embrace. [[1847 旁白 happy]]
Is it time to go back? [[1848 塞伦安 neutral]]
To correct my mistakes, to atone for my sins, to... [[1849 塞伦安 neutral]]
Wait! [[1850 塞伦安 surprised]]
Saintess? [[1851 塞伦安 surprised]]
Me?! [[1852 塞伦安 surprised]]
