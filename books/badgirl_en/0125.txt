Chapter 125: Surrounded and Killed [[7402 旁白 neutral]]
    "Do you really think you've got this in the bag?" [[7403 旁白 neutral]]
    Vlad, leaning on his forehead, was in a terrible state. Yet, his aura didn't weaken; instead, it seemed to be growing back. His power surged like a wild horse without reins, and more bloodshot veins appeared in the whites of his eyes. [[7404 旁白 neutral]]
    "Four Fifth-Tier... and you think you can take me?" [[7405 旁白 angry]]
    He raised his hand, extended his index finger, and swayed slightly as he pointed at the three. His other hand covered his bleeding eye, and a hint of madness was hidden in his hoarse voice. [[7406 旁白 angry]]
    "Be careful, his mental state is very wrong." [[7407 塞莱斯特 fearful]]
    Celeste sent her voice to their ears through the wind. Sigrid nodded without surprise, while Medea tensed up even more, gently stroking the coffin behind her. [[7408 旁白 neutral]]
    The three surrounded Vlad from three directions in the center. The demonic handsome man with silver hair bent his body, covering his face with both hands, a sinister and crazy smile on his lips. [[7409 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hahahaha... so what if two Saintesses plotted against me? Even if I'm hurt, I'm still a Sixth-Tier Duke!" [[7410 弗拉德 angry]]
    The actions of the two Saintesses, treating Vlad like a fool, thoroughly angered him. When rage completely burns away reason, whatever he does, no matter how insane, is no longer strange. [[7411 旁白 neutral]]
    Right now, Vlad's actions couldn't be guessed using common sense. [[7412 旁白 neutral]]
    And the facts proved this point— [[7413 旁白 neutral]]
    The crazy man raised his sword, but this time the tip was pointing inward. A smile spread across his lips, and his bloodshot eyes, completely taken over by madness, held a primal joy. [[7414 旁白 neutral]]
    Finally, finally, he would have another chance to enjoy a feast without any worries! [[7415 弗拉德 happy]]
    "Then please, either kill me or be killed by me, and become an eternal part of my river of blood!" [[7416 弗拉德 angry]]
    Gripping his blood-stained sword, he plunged the blade into his chest without hesitation. With a dull thud as it entered his body, half the sword pierced through his back. Blood stained his exquisite noble clothes, spreading like ink. [[7417 旁白 neutral]]
    Immediately after, with a "swoosh," several scarlet thorns burst out of the wound where the sword had pierced. Like living blood-thorn vines, they greedily sucked the blood of the Sixth-Tier strong man. Having tasted sweetness, they grew even more gluttonous. The wound was stretched open inch by inch, and more and more thorns emerged until Vlad's body was completely torn apart and swallowed by these blood-thorn vines that sprang up like mushrooms after rain. [[7418 旁白 fearful]]
    Endless blood gushed out from the center of the altar like a tide, reaching the three in an instant. Medea instinctively retreated, as the blood bursting from Vlad's body gave her a very ominous feeling, as if something very bad would happen just by touching it. [[7419 旁白 fearful]]
    But the altar itself wasn't very big; after only a few steps back, she had reached the edge. The witch, who was about to retreat further, suddenly felt her body lighten and almost fell. Fortunately, she quickly used magic to maintain her balance. She instinctively looked behind her; below was the Kempfer ruins, which had been reduced to rubble. [[7420 旁白 neutral]]
    There was still a place here now, and it could be rebuilt in the future. But if a Sixth-Tier bloodkin's blood was allowed to spill, this land would be completely polluted and uninhabitable. At the same time, the traces left by her ancestors and her nearly lifelong memories would be destroyed. [[7421 旁白 sad]]
    But with her power... [[7422 旁白 sad]]
    "Rise!" [[7423 旁白 neutral]]
    Her thoughts were instantly cut off. Her heels, which had no foothold before, suddenly felt a solid place beneath them. The sound of crystals forming instantly echoed in her ears. Looking down, she saw that blood crystals were automatically spreading out at the edge of the ritual altar. [[7424 旁白 neutral]]
    Sigrid stood still, her rapier glowing red. The soft cry just now came from her. Her bloodkin bloodline came from Cassandra, and she naturally inherited Cassandra's ability to control and create blood crystals. [[7425 旁白 neutral]]
    Paving the ground with blood crystals was her method. [[7426 旁白 neutral]]
    From an outsider's perspective, this was nothing but unnecessary waste of power. The Duke's blood was still gushing out with an almost endless momentum. The best way was to let these blood expand, measure their limits, and then target them. [[7427 旁白 neutral]]
    But Sigrid still made her move. After all, it was Selen An who controlled this body, a living person. He had lived on this land for four years, and it had left him with countless unforgettable and precious memories during that time. In a sense, it could completely be considered his second home. [[7428 旁白 neutral]]
    Secondly, the fact that her hometown was leveled was unavoidable, but she would never allow this land to be defiled by dirty blood again. [[7429 旁白 angry]]
    The tidal wave of blood had long since reached her knees. Pale, rotting drummers emerged from the river of blood, one after another, as if trying to grab her limbs or skirt and drag her to the bottom of the river. But these attacks were all shattered by the dark thorns extending from the shadows behind her. [[7430 旁白 neutral]]
    Unlike her Water Saintess form, which required special skill activation, this body in its bloodkin form was skilled in blood magic and shadow magic, and both of these elemental magics had their attack skills maxed out. [[7431 旁白 neutral]]
    Although it contained all of Cassandra's power, it still failed to break through to the Sixth-Tier even after gaining the blood of a Sixth-Tier bloodkin. However, because of this, this Fifth-Tier bloodkin body had an exceptionally vast magic reserve. [[7432 旁白 neutral]]
    Every inch the blood tide encroached outwards, Sigrid controlled the blood crystals to spread out another foot. Moreover, she wasn't the only one fighting to prevent the blood tide from flowing into the ground— [[7433 旁白 neutral]]
    Celeste had activated her [Wings of Wind] at the very first moment. Lead-like feathers woven from emerald green magic formed the wings spread behind the girl. She soared in the sky, holding high the cross-shaped spear from Isabella, and chanted. [[7434 旁白 neutral]]
    "Listen, unseen breath!" [[7435 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    "Answer my call, ever-flowing wind!" [[7436 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    "By the heavens, by freedom's name..." [[7437 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    "Gather here, build an insurmountable barrier." [[7438 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    [Wind Element: Domain-Type: Wall of Sighs] [[7439 旁白 neutral]]
    Thousands of sharp winds obeyed the girl's command. Following the direction of her spear tip, a towering emerald green wind wall suddenly rose from the ground, with the altar's edge as its boundary. It wasn't a static barrier but a circular tornado belt made of countless high-speed, swirling, air-cutting violent currents. [[7440 旁白 neutral]]
    Inside the wind wall, the air howled like ten thousand galloping horses, or the roar of a giant dragon, forming a visible, destructive turbulent zone. Any foul blood or rotten hands that tried to cross were instantly torn into the finest blood mist by the violent wind blades upon contact, then swept into the wind wall by the high-speed airflow, completely vanishing into nothingness. [[7441 旁白 neutral]]
    The wind whistled low, and at this moment, it sounded particularly like the sigh of the Wind God. [[7442 旁白 neutral]]
    The two Saintesses exerted their power together, restraining Vlad's power at the very first moment. Although it was rumored that Saintesses played with mechanics and demons played with numbers, once the numbers reached an exaggerated level, even mechanics would struggle. [[7443 旁白 neutral]]
    Facing a nearly insane Sixth-Tier bloodkin duke, no amount of caution was too much. [[7444 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing that the sea of blood had not fully spread, Vlad, who was fully integrated into the river of blood, controlled countless undead to crawl out of the river. They rushed towards the wind wall, one after another, with only one goal: to punch a hole in it. [[7445 旁白 neutral]]
    All at once, from the murky river of blood, countless pale rotting corpses and skeletons wriggled out like maggots. They ignored the cutting wind blades, throwing themselves at the emerald green wind wall one after another. [[7446 旁白 neutral]]
    Dull "squelching" sounds were endless. Limbs torn apart by the high-speed airflow turned into putrid bloody rain, pouring back into the river. But more undead surged forward, stepping on the remains of their companions. [[7447 旁白 neutral]]
    The Wall of Sighs trembled violently, emitting a humming sound of unbearable strain. Celeste gritted her teeth, her spear-holding arm trembling slightly, the emerald green light flickering, as she forcibly maintained this fragile barrier. [[7448 旁白 neutral]]
    The blood crystal platform under Sigrid's feet emitted faint cracking sounds under the trampling of the undead and the impact of the blood waves. Her eyes were sharp as knives. She plunged her blood rapier into the platform, and scarlet magic surged. The shattered blood crystals instantly mended, and the edges spread upward like living things, forming a barrier of sharp crystal thorns that pierced and shredded the climbing rotten hands. [[7449 旁白 neutral]]
    Medea flew into the air, her red hair billowing with her surging magic. She chanted ancient spells, doing her best to draw power from the stars. [[7450 旁白 neutral]]
    [Starry Secret Art: Descent of a Thousand Stars] [[7451 旁白 neutral]]
    In the sky, the light of the stars became even brighter. Countless streams of light fell from the sky like meteors, crashing into the surging sea of blood. Each beam of light created a huge ripple and wave of blood upon impact. [[7452 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing that the first wave of the blood sea was about to be suppressed by the three, and the blood sea couldn't fully spread out, Vlad's power couldn't be truly shown. This was something he absolutely could not tolerate, so... [[7453 旁白 neutral]]
    Within the surging waves, flesh wriggled. Four or five Hellhounds, as if crawled out of hell, slowly rose from the blood. They shook their massive heads, as if shaking off the blood clinging to their skinless flesh. Exaggeratedly huge mouths revealed pale, sharp fangs, and putrid saliva dripped from their tips. [[7454 旁白 fearful]]
    The magic fluctuations displayed by these Hellhounds were all at the weak Fifth-Tier. The three immediately noticed this. Medea in the air controlled the falling starlight to concentrate and smash these newly emerged monsters, trying to smash these deep creatures that had crawled out of hell back to guard the gates. [[7455 旁白 neutral]]
    But the starlight that could burn the earth and crush dust, when it struck their ugly bodies, only left scorched marks and couldn't cause serious injuries. These injuries quickly healed within a few breaths. [[7456 旁白 neutral]]
    The Hellhounds dug at the ground with their four legs, stirring up blood waves. Their huge bodies charged fiercely towards the Wall of Sighs like trains. [[7457 旁白 neutral]]
    Sigrid immediately locked onto the closest Hellhound. The shadow behind her writhed again, bursting out hundreds of thick shadow thorns. These thorns wove into a giant devil's claw, grabbing hold of the fast-moving Hellhound. Sharp thorns pierced its skin and even bones, making it impossible for the prey to break free. [[7458 旁白 neutral]]
    "Die!" [[7459 旁白 angry]]
    The bloodkin girl leaped into mid-air, her figure like a streak of light. With just a cold judgment, her rapier flashed in an instant. The Hellhound, which had been struggling fiercely, instantly froze. Its three massive heads smoothly slid from its neck and fell into the sea of blood. [[7460 旁白 neutral]]
    Celeste did the same. Wind gathered in her cross-shaped spear. As she threw it, the spear shot out like a dragon, and a turbulent wind, spiraling around the spear, turned into the brightest cyan comet in the night sky. Like an arrow of light falling from the heavens, it directly pierced another three-headed Hellhound that tried to break through the Wall of Sighs. [[7461 旁白 neutral]]
    The Hellhound was directly suppressed and lay on the ground. The next second, countless blades followed, and flesh, tendons, and bones all dispersed into a blood mist from countless cuts. [[7462 旁白 neutral]]
    In just a blink of an eye, two Fifth-Tier demonic creatures were eliminated. Such powerful strength was enough to deter any enemy, but this was the river of blood. The undead crawling out of the river had no fear. No matter how many died, as long as Vlad was alive, he could pull out those subordinates he had devoured before. [[7463 旁白 neutral]]
    And without even fighting a war of attrition, two Hellhounds had already broken through the Saintesses' blockade, violently crashing into the already crumbling Wall of Sighs. The previously orderly airflow immediately dispersed, revealing two huge gaps. The pervasive blood immediately found an outlet and poured out. [[7464 旁白 fearful]]
    Damn, still couldn't stop them? [[7465 旁白 sad]]
    Medea, who was already exerting her full power, had a hint of gloom flash in her eyes—a self-blame named "I can't do anything." It was just a pity that the protagonist of this battle wasn't her. [[7466 旁白 sad]]
    Celeste still wanted to make amends in time, to add another layer of wind barrier in mid-air to intercept all the blood mixed with Vlad's mental essence, but someone was clearly a step ahead of her— [[7467 旁白 neutral]]
    Just as the blood was about to pour out from the gap, Sigrid's figure suddenly blurred. It wasn't high-speed movement, but an instantaneous form switch—the demonic bloodkin features faded like a tide, replaced by waterfall-like azure long hair and pure, vast water element fluctuations surrounding her! [[7468 旁白 neutral]]
    [Water Element: Super-Tier: Immaculate Cage] [[7469 旁白 neutral]]
    "Water, may you imprison this impurity." [[7470 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Her clear voice echoed through the night sky, and she abruptly spread her hands to her sides. [[7471 旁白 neutral]]
    The blood crystal platform under her feet collapsed, turning into a pure torrent of water elements that shot up into the sky! This water flow was so pure it contained not a single impurity, carrying a biting aura that cleansed all things, extending and converging in all directions at an astonishing speed. [[7472 旁白 neutral]]
    An incredibly vast, azure sphere made of pure liquid water instantly enveloped the entire floating altar, the surging river of blood, and even Medea and Celeste in mid-air! [[7473 旁白 neutral]]
    The blood crashed against the flowing spherical wall, emitting a harsh "sizzle" sound, and was forcibly blocked, purified, and bounced back. The entire blood river battlefield, along with Vlad's foul tidal wave, was completely sealed within this giant water sphere, suspended above the Kempfer ruins, forming a strange and spectacular sight—an azure water prison encasing a boiling blood hell, a fragile balance established here. [[7474 旁白 neutral]]
    But the matter was far from over here. Lobelia clasped her hands together, in a praying posture. In the very center of the giant water sphere cage, several forms completely different from the Saintess were reflected like a water mirror: [[7475 旁白 neutral]]
    Pink light, seductive and demonic; golden light, pious and firm; red light, noble and aloof. Along with her own person, blue light, sacred and immaculate. From then on, Selen An displayed all the forms he possessed. [[7476 旁白 neutral]]
