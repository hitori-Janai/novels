Chapter 117: Fierce Battle [[6874 旁白 neutral]]
    Medea's worldview was also successfully, albeit briefly, shattered. [[6875 旁白 neutral]]
    How could she not know how lethal weapons made of Wolf King Steel Bone were to blood kin? [[6876 旁白 neutral]]
    The power of the Wolf King and the power of the blood kin were like fire and water, incompatible. [[6877 旁白 neutral]]
    As a result, a divine weapon specifically designed to counter blood kin could actually be used to perform a blood sacrifice that activated blood kin power. This phenomenon once again made her wonder if she was getting old, and if her long years in this small place of Kempf had made her lose touch with the latest news from the outside world. [[6878 旁白 neutral]]
    "Grandma Medea, I'll hold him off; you go destroy the ritual." [[6879 西格利德 neutral]]
    The girl's voice reminded the somewhat dazed red-haired witch. Medea reacted, nodded quickly, and flashed towards the cross in the center of the altar. [[6880 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing this, Vlad did not rush to stop her. He merely let Medea go with a cold gaze, most of his attention still focused on this exceptionally strange blood kin girl. [[6881 旁白 neutral]]
    "Since this lady is of the same clan, I think there's no need for us to make things difficult for each other." [[6882 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Seeing that he couldn't gain a significant advantage in terms of power, Vlad began to try to resolve the problem non-violently. [[6883 旁白 neutral]]
    "Your tone wasn't so polite and gentlemanly when you just called me an ignorant child." [[6884 西格利德 neutral]]
    But in response to Vlad's emotional plea and invitation to a truce, the blood kin girl merely tilted her sword forward. [[6885 旁白 neutral]]
    "Uh... beautiful lady, being so calculative is not a quality a noble lady should possess." [[6886 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Vlad clearly hadn't expected such an elegant-looking girl to be so vengeful in personality. [[6887 旁白 surprised]]
    "But I am someone who likes to exact revenge for every grievance." [[6888 西格利德 neutral]]
    "Clang!" [[6889 旁白 neutral]]
    Their blood swords collided once again. With both sides having activated blood sacrifice, the Tier 6 Vlad actually couldn't gain a clear advantage in close combat against the Tier 5 Sigrid. [[6890 旁白 neutral]]
    On the other side, Medea rushed directly towards the cross with her naginata. Just as the inverted cross was in sight, the red-haired witch raised her blade to strike, but the direction of the blood chains she originally aimed for was blocked by a pair of twin blades. [[6891 旁白 neutral]]
    The glinting naginata blade was firmly caught between the crossed twin blades. Medea focused her eyes and saw that the person blocking her was a blonde female blood kin; this person was Avril, transformed from Seraphina. [[6892 旁白 neutral]]
    "Get out of the way!" [[6893 梅黛亚 angry]]
    Medea coldly shouted, exerting force in her hand. The naginata scraped out from the jammed blades, and a sharp metallic clang sparked a flurry of sparks. [[6894 旁白 neutral]]
    "The master's command cannot be disobeyed." [[6895 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    The blonde Avril held her twin blades, not backing down an inch. [[6896 旁白 neutral]]
    "Then I can only... Ugh!" [[6897 梅黛亚 neutral]]
    Upon sensing that the opponent's aura was only strong Tier 4, Medea prepared to force her way through. The suppression in terms of power level could not be offset by mere tricks, and moreover, witches were experts at dealing with vampires. [[6898 旁白 neutral]]
    But just as she was about to make her move, a fierce pang struck her chest. All her strength seemed to drain away, and she instantly slumped, half-kneeling on the ground. Fortunately, her hands were gripping the upright naginata, which prevented her from completely collapsing. [[6899 旁白 fearful]]
    Not good. [[6900 梅黛亚 fearful]]
    The amplification time is up... [[6901 梅黛亚 fearful]]
    Borrowed power, after all, did not belong to her. Once the time exceeded the maximum threshold, the youth and strength that had already flowed away from her will dissipate again. [[6902 旁白 neutral]]
    Medea could clearly feel the power contained within her body uncontrollably leaking out like steam. Although her appearance had not yet significantly changed, her red hair, which represented the passion of life, began to lose its luster. [[6903 旁白 sad]]
    "Stop it, you're old." [[6904 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    The blonde blood kin girl looked down at the witch half-kneeling on the ground with a hint of pity, her voice faint. [[6905 旁白 neutral]]
    "Old? Heh heh..." [[6906 梅黛亚 neutral]]
    Her weak voice carried a barely perceptible tremor. The red-haired witch finally struggled to raise her head, a stubborn smile on her increasingly pale and bloodless face. [[6907 旁白 neutral]]
    "Indeed, compared to you young people, I have indeed lost my youth, but don't forget..." [[6908 梅黛亚 neutral]]
    Her power was fading, but her vitality burned in reverse. There seemed to be light in the red-haired witch's eyes, and deep red ripples spread through the surrounding air. [[6909 旁白 neutral]]
    "I am a descendant of witches, with the bloodline of the immortal witch flowing within me!" [[6910 梅黛亚 neutral]]
    The resounding voice seemed to ignite all the restless magic in the air. Avril sensed something was wrong and tried to distance herself, only to find her body unable to move. [[6911 旁白 surprised]]
    Medea abandoned the naginata in her hands and instead completely controlled her magic power. She unleashed the power within her without reservation. Deep red magic resonated with the various elemental magic in the air, and her ruby-like eyes shone brilliantly. [[6912 旁白 neutral]]
    The surrounding air was like walls pressing in from all directions. Avril felt her body being constantly compressed. If this continued, her bones would be crushed, and shattered bones mixed with broken internal organs would be completely squeezed into a pulp. [[6913 旁白 fearful]]
    At the brink of life and death, Avril, who had been resisting the blood kin power at all times, instinctively activated her bloodline power. Her shadow directly detached from her physical form, transforming into sharp thorns that pierced through the invisible wall of air. [[6914 旁白 neutral]]
    Freed from danger, the blonde girl knelt on the ground, coughing violently. Blood splattered on the twin blades in her hands, coating their silver surface with a scarlet hue. [[6915 旁白 neutral]]
    "I will not let you pass!" [[6916 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    Struggling to her feet, Avril wiped the bloodstains from the corner of her mouth, her eyes equally resolute. [[6917 旁白 neutral]]
    The battle had reached this point, clearly defined. [[6918 旁白 neutral]]
    Sigrid vs. Vlad, Avril vs. Medea. [[6919 旁白 neutral]]
    Neither side in either battle could achieve victory in a short time. A fierce battle meant the passage of time, and Celeste, bound on the cross in the posture of a suffering sinner, was also undergoing the most crucial step of her life. [[6920 旁白 neutral]]
    The blood exchange of the embrace ritual was stripping away the human part of her body piece by piece. As the embrace progressed to this stage, her physical body had completely diverged from that of a human. [[6921 旁白 neutral]]
    Normally, a person would be complete at this stage, as the embraced body would influence the soul to some extent. Even without much "care," the physical changes would completely permeate and mutate the original soul. But she was different... [[6922 旁白 neutral]]
    A Saintess's soul and body both possessed extremely high strength. To prevent a situation where the body changed but the mind didn't, Vlad specifically added a portion of his own blood to the embrace ritual. [[6923 旁白 neutral]]
    Blood was the most precious thing to a blood kin. Powerful blood kin even had a portion of their will contained in every drop of their blood. Vlad's intention was to infuse a large amount of his consciousness deep into Celeste's soul by shedding more blood, thereby completely purifying her from the inside out into the blood kin bride he desired. [[6924 旁白 neutral]]
    As long as both body and soul submitted, even if the Wind God herself came, there would be no salvation. After all, in a sense, Celeste, whose body and mind had both been changed, was no longer the original person. The human Saintess had completely died, leaving behind only a newly born blood kin with past memories. [[6925 旁白 neutral]]
    And now, the physical assimilation was largely complete; the most important part, the spiritual cleansing had just begun... [[6926 旁白 neutral]]
