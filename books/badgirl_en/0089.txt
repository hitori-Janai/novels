Chapter 89: Blurry [[5045 旁白 neutral]]
By evening, the third Holy Nun that Mo Ying had mentioned finally arrived. [[5046 旁白 neutral]]
But unlike Isabella's flashy arrival on wings of wind, or Mo Ying's shocking transformation into a bolt of green light, this young lady, despite her title of Holy Nun, did not appear in such a grand manner. Instead, she arrived silently, hidden within the shadows. [[5047 旁白 neutral]]
Andre watched as a strange shadow crept into the hall along the slanted shade of the church door. Then, like black modeling clay shaping itself, the moving shadow transformed into the figure of a mysterious nun hidden in the darkness. [[5048 旁白 surprised]]
Her entrance was quite peculiar—less like a Holy Nun and more like an assassin. The girl in the black dress appeared before everyone. What was the same was that all three of them wore identical divinely-patterned nun habits. What was different was that this girl, named Seraphina, had the lower half of her face completely covered by a black veil. [[5049 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting." [[5050 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The girl's voice was pleasant, but it carried a slow, low tone. [[5051 旁白 neutral]]
Andre scanned his newly arrived accomplice and couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. He had assumed the followers of the drama-queen Wind Saintess were all lazy or scatterbrained like Isabella, but this one seemed surprisingly serious. [[5052 安德烈 neutral]]
She wore her black-and-white nun's habit like an assassin's cloak, and the black veil covering half her face added to her mystery. She had a slender figure, was a woman of few words, and one could tell from her eyes alone that she was at least a graceful beauty. [[5053 旁白 neutral]]
With an image like that, showing up at your door in the evening claiming to be your ally—based on Andre's experience reading countless novels in his past life, this girl was definitely reliable! [[5054 安德烈 happy]]
Just as the man was thinking this, a fragrant breeze swept past him. A petite figure rushed straight toward the mysterious nun and, right under everyone's noses, shamelessly burrowed into her embrace. [[5055 旁白 surprised]]
"Mmm, Seraphina, you're finally here! I missed you to death~" [[5056 墨莺 happy]]
Faced with Mo Ying's childlike pouting, the woman's emotionally reserved almond eyes curved into a smile. She gently hugged the girl in her arms. From Andre's perspective, he could clearly sense the strong fragrance of lilies coming from their intimate embrace. [[5057 旁白 neutral]]
"We haven't seen each other for a few days, and you've gotten lighter, my lady." [[5058 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Mmm~ It's because you weren't by my side, Seraphina. I thought about you day and night, lost my appetite for food and tea, so I got thinner~ So? Hug me more, lift me up high!" [[5059 墨莺 happy]]
The girl lifted her head from within the soft, ample bosom, enjoying the warm fragrance of the female body. She widened her watery almond eyes, her voice so flirtatious that Andre felt his bones go soft for a moment, and then his whole body broke out in goosebumps. [[5060 旁白 surprised]]
Holy crap, the current Wind Saintess isn't just a drama queen, she's also using a fake cutesy voice! [[5061 安德烈 angry]]
He watched as Seraphina actually lifted Mo Ying high with both hands. Turning his head, he saw a rare, shy blush appear on the usually carefree Isabella's face. [[5062 旁白 surprised]]
Hey now, why are you blushing? [[5063 安德烈 surprised]]
She's not acting cute for you, so what's with that blissful look on your face? [[5064 安德烈 surprised]]
Finally, Andre couldn't watch anymore and spoke up to remind them. [[5065 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahem... Could you tone it down a bit? This is a church, after all, and under the gaze of the Wind God's statue. It's improper." [[5066 安德烈 angry]]
He faked a cough, trying to snap the three girls out of their lily-scented daze, but he was met with Seraphina's indifference, Mo Ying's confusion, and a disgusted look from Isabella. [[5067 旁白 sad]]
"I say, Father Andre, your thinking is too old-fashioned, isn't it? Free emotions are a divine oracle from the Wind God himself. Normal affection between sisters like this, isn't it perfectly normal?" [[5068 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
You'd better open your eyes and see if this still counts as normal sisterly affection. [[5069 安德烈 angry]]
That scent of lilies and oranges is so strong I'm almost too embarrassed to say anything! [[5070 安德烈 angry]]
Andre couldn't help but complain in his heart. [[5071 旁白 neutral]]
But then again, he was amazed that he himself would say a classic old-timer line like "Have you no decency?" [[5072 安德烈 surprised]]
Damn it, after staying here for so long, I really started to see this as a normal world. But in the end, the basic template of the world hasn't changed. A porn game is still a porn game. If the relationships aren't messy, the players won't like it~ [[5073 安德烈 sad]]
For a moment, the man mourned in his heart, mourning that he was gradually becoming like the older generation. [[5074 旁白 sad]]
But watching this beautiful scene of girls being close, Andre couldn't shake a persistent feeling of "dread." [[5075 安德烈 fearful]]
He didn't know why, but over the past four years, his memory of the game's plot had become increasingly blurry, as if an invisible force was intentionally fading or erasing specific memories. [[5076 旁白 fearful]]
This was why he didn't recognize the Wind Saintess immediately when he first saw her, only feeling a strange sense of familiarity. The erosion of his memory had already begun to show, just like now... [[5077 旁白 fearful]]
He vaguely remembered that in the game, the ending for the Wind Saintess was not much better than his own original fate or Serenia's. Even when he tried his best to recall, he could only capture some disjointed images— [[5078 旁白 fearful]]
He faintly remembered that at a key moment, this young Wind Saintess was surrounded and ambushed by demons. Her loyal Holy Nuns used themselves as bait, tearing a bloody path through the demons' iron-clad encirclement for their Saintess. [[5079 旁白 fearful]]
By doing so, these young, beautiful, and powerful Holy Nuns naturally became the most coveted prizes in the eyes of the demons. But the path to life that these nuns had bought with their own descent into hell did not allow the Wind Saintess to escape her doom. [[5080 旁白 fearful]]
In short, this part of the plot included, but was not limited to, exciting tags for old perverts like corruption, coercion, virgin, demonization, and yuri-breaking. [[5081 旁白 neutral]]
Although the current timeline had changed significantly because of him, the demons wouldn't give up just because of one setback. On the contrary, if they couldn't get what they wanted from him, the descendant of the Water Saintess, they would turn their attention to others. [[5082 旁白 fearful]]
Combined with the Wind Saintess's sudden visit to Kempf Town, the dangerous seal hidden beneath the town, and a vampire duke who seemed to have lost his mind and was eyeing this place, a simple logical analysis made the feeling of dread in Andre's heart grow stronger and stronger... [[5083 旁白 fearful]]
But when his fingertips touched the two smooth keys in his pocket, the cold touch of the metal calmed his uneasy heart slightly. [[5084 旁白 neutral]]
There's nothing to worry about. Although I know that a key moment like this—venturing deep into a seal as a group—is bound to trigger some crucial plot points, this is fate. You can't escape it, right? [[5085 安德烈 neutral]]
Everything is ready. Faced with fate, all they can do is move forward with composure. [[5086 安德烈 neutral]]
At the very end, if the Wind God truly exists, then please, take a look at this unremarkable corner. Just one glance, even if only for the sake of the descendant who carries your divine blood... [[5087 安德烈 neutral]]
May the wind... carve its path. [[5088 安德烈 neutral]]
