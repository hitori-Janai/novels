Chapter 15: Reset 15 - This Is What I Owe You [[911 旁白 neutral]]
"You can go." [[912 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Those three short words entered Selen An's mind, making it freeze for a moment. [[913 旁白 surprised]]
Wait, didn't I just miss one full meal? [[914 塞伦安 surprised]]
Is this body so weak that I'm starting to hear things? [[915 塞伦安 surprised]]
Seeing the young man's stunned and disbelieving look, Serenia turned her face away. [[916 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't doubt it. I mean it. I will save the mother and daughter inside. Once I get the three of you out of danger, I'll let you go." [[917 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
The girl's voice was very light, so light that a gust of wind could blow it away. Yet, her voice was also very heavy, striking Selen An's heart like a great hammer. [[918 旁白 neutral]]
"Why?" [[919 塞伦安 surprised]]
When faced with something truly shocking and hard to understand, people often ignore the result and look for the reason instead. [[920 旁白 neutral]]
"There is no reason. It's simply what I want to do." [[921 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"If you let me go, what will happen to you when you return?" [[922 塞伦安 fearful]]
Looking at the seemingly cold girl before him, after hearing that she would let him go, the first emotion in Selen An's heart was not the secret joy of freedom, but an almost subconscious worry for Serenia. [[923 旁白 neutral]]
If I remember correctly, assassinating me was a divine oracle from the God of Ice. If Serenia didn't kill me and just took me back, she might have an excuse. But to just let me go... [[924 塞伦安 fearful]]
How is that different from a prison guard simply letting a prisoner go free? [[925 塞伦安 fearful]]
A guard who breaks the law is punished by the law. But in this world, order is maintained by the gods, not by laws. [[926 塞伦安 fearful]]
Defying the will of a god will never lead to a good end. [[927 塞伦安 fearful]]
"I am a Saintess. I have my ways..." [[928 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
The girl was still so cold, not giving him a reasonable answer. She paused, and a flicker of hard-to-see worry crossed her ice-blue eyes. [[929 旁白 neutral]]
"You, after you leave here, change your name. Try not to have any connection to your old identity, especially The Church and the Winterlein Family." [[930 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Serenia's sudden warning confused Selen An, but he wasn't a fool. Connecting it to the game's later plot and some hidden story threads only a player would know, he instantly guessed a possibility. [[931 旁白 surprised]]
A mole! [[932 塞伦安 surprised]]
The mole here wasn't just Mara, who had infiltrated the Winterlein family, but also someone in the Saintess's family and The Church. [[933 旁白 fearful]]
As the direct descendant of the Water Saintess, Selen An's safety should have been treated as a rare treasure by the Winterlein Family. Even though he was a useless fighter who couldn't awaken his bloodline, his ability to continue the direct lineage of the Saintess was enough to warrant the family's strongest protection. [[934 旁白 neutral]]
But what was the reality? [[935 旁白 sad]]
Yes, on the surface, the Winterlein Family "protected" Selen An closely. No matter what terrible things he did, the family would clean up his mess. But this wasn't protection, it was covering for him! It was indulgence! [[936 旁白 angry]]
On the surface, Selen An was the most noble person in the family. But if that were true, how could the son of the previous Saintess, a direct descendant, be silently implanted with a Succubus Seed by a demon spy under the family's protection? [[937 旁白 angry]]
To put it more harshly, the fact that a Succubus Seed was brought into the Saintess's family was, in itself, unforgivable! [[938 旁白 angry]]
But the plot still happened this way. The Saintess's son was implanted with the seed, and the Winterlein Family only woke up to it just before the crisis exploded. He would never believe that Mara had done it all by herself. [[939 旁白 fearful]]
There was another spy in the Winterlein Family, no, a traitor! [[940 塞伦安 fearful]]
Because it wasn't just the demons who wanted to harm him. His status was coveted, and his bloodline was feared, by his own siblings in the family, and by the Pope of The Church who had sent Mara to his family. [[941 旁白 fearful]]
The connections were incredibly complex, not something that could be sorted out in a short time. [[942 旁白 neutral]]
But Serenia's warning made Selen An clearly understand how foolish his earlier idea of returning to the family to be a stud master was. Right now, the Winterlein Family was a dragon's den and a tiger's lair for him. [[943 旁白 fearful]]
Those people in the family with bad intentions, since they succeeded once, could succeed a second time, a third time... The enemy was in the dark while I am in the light. There's no escaping it! [[944 塞伦安 fearful]]
"As for the Succubus Seed inside you, I've managed to seal it with ice. The seal is stable. As long as nothing unexpected happens, the seed won't be activated, even after a hundred years." [[945 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Seeing Selen An's mind racing as he processed the information, Serenia added another comment. [[946 旁白 neutral]]
The young man came back to his senses and looked at the girl before him. Her silver hair still shone like a river of stars in the moonlight, but her Saintess dress was stained with dried blood. [[947 旁白 sad]]
She seemed as hard as ice, so cold that she kept people at a distance. But in Selen An's eyes, she was still the same little girl from his memories, carefully protecting the few "flames" in her world. [[948 旁白 sad]]
"...Thank you." [[949 塞伦安 sad]]
At this point, he couldn't find any other words of gratitude. As for repaying Serenia's kindness? [[950 旁白 sad]]
With his current identity and condition, not being a burden was already a blessing. [[951 旁白 sad]]
"You don't need to thank me..." [[952 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
The girl walked past the young man towards the wooden hut, her silver hair flying. The evening breeze seemed to leave a faint, sweet scent on the tip of his nose. [[953 旁白 neutral]]
"After all, this is what I owe you." [[954 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
Selen An stared at the girl's back, stunned. The words felt strangely familiar, as if he had heard them somewhere before. Then, his clear vision began to blur and distort, followed by a sharp, needle-like pain in his mind. [[955 旁白 fearful]]
"Ugh...!" [[956 塞伦安 fearful]]
The feeling from when he was unconscious returned. Along with the strange sensation in his body, an image of being consumed by flames filled his vision. [[957 旁白 fearful]]
On a wasteland battlefield shrouded in black smoke, a dense tide of demon cavalry charged toward two figures. At the center of the battlefield, a girl blessed by ice and snow held a frost sword, carving a bloody path through the demon army's encirclement! [[958 旁白 fearful]]
Blood stained her dress and messed up her long hair. The demons, feeling no fear or pain, constantly reached for the young man she protected behind her with their greedy claws. The fear of death terrified the young master, who was used to a life of comfort. [[959 旁白 fearful]]
Facing the demons' hideous faces and bloody blades, he collapsed to the ground, so scared he could only weakly grab Serenia's leg, seeking a bit of safety. [[960 旁白 fearful]]
The two were like trapped animals in a swamp. No matter how brave and unstoppable the girl was, facing an endless horde of enemies while also taking care of a burdensome young master who only held her back, she was reaching the brink of collapse, both physically and mentally. [[961 旁白 fearful]]
"Hehe, give up, Saintess of the Ice God. The moment you were surrounded, your fate was sealed." [[962 魔将 angry]]
Among the demon army, a general built like an iron tower, covered in black keratin armor, rode a hell-horse burning with hellfire and mocked the struggling girl. [[963 旁白 fearful]]
The girl swung her sword, freezing three demon soldiers in front of her into ice. She then casually beheaded six demon hounds that leaped at her. The spoiled young master clinging to her leg was pale with fear from the scene. [[964 旁白 fearful]]
"Serenia, save me, save me!" [[965 塞伦安 fearful]]
The general's laughter, the soldiers' screams, the pounding of the cavalry, and her childhood friend's weak pleas for help all mixed together, making every breath for the exhausted girl incredibly difficult. [[966 旁白 sad]]
With her strength, she could break out of the demon encirclement, but with Selen An, who was completely helpless, they would both be dragged down and killed here. [[967 旁白 fearful]]
Should I give up? [[968 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
Selen An was supposed to die anyway. This was decided by the Ice God's oracle. [[969 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
If she abandoned him now, she could still escape. She had already given him chances, many chances. She had done all she could. Even if she left Selen An and retreated alone, no one would blame or mock her, not even the demon general on the hell-horse. [[970 旁白 sad]]
Every intelligent being present saw it. They saw her fight with all her might to save her childhood friend. But even now, after so many warnings, he could only cling to her leg, crying weakly, begging to live. [[971 旁白 sad]]
If he could just be a little tougher, not even to help, but just to stay quiet and follow closely behind her, she would never have thought of giving up. But carrying a burden who only cried was too tiring, so tiring that she wanted to just drop her sword and let things happen... [[972 旁白 sad]]
What should I choose? [[973 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
The remaining magic in her body was only enough for one more choice. [[974 旁白 sad]]
To retreat alone, or... [[975 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
Time seemed to stretch infinitely in that moment. The girl lowered her gaze, looking at the young man still clinging to her leg, crying like an immature child. [[976 旁白 sad]]
She closed her eyes, perhaps tired, perhaps weary. [[977 旁白 sad]]
So, let it be... [[978 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
As she opened her eyes again, a pale, mighty power swept across the battlefield. Ice crystals began to climb up her skin, taking away what little warmth she had left. And the power gained at this cost tore a gap in the tightly blocked battlefield. [[979 旁白 fearful]]
Seizing the opportunity, she pulled the collapsed young man up, gathered magic in her palm, and pushed him on the back, sending him toward the gap filled with wreckage and flesh. [[980 旁白 sad]]
The young man, flying through the air, stared blankly at the girl who was getting farther and farther away. He saw a smile on her pale, bloodless face. Was it relief, or a bitter smile? [[981 旁白 sad]]
The young man couldn't see clearly, but as he watched the shape of her lips, her familiar voice exploded in his mind like thunder. [[982 旁白 surprised]]
"This is what I owe you." [[983 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
