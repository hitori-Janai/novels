Chapter 130: The Reward [[7984 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ah, old sir, my patience is limited. If you keep pestering me like this, I'll have to be impolite~" [[7985 米菈 angry]]
    The seemingly soft, extremely charming voice fell into the elder's ears, but it hid murderous intent. [[7986 旁白 neutral]]
    The red-robed bishop straightened his back. His aged face was already covered in the ravages of time, and now, it wrinkled even deeper due to his opponent's words. [[7987 旁白 sad]]
    "I don't care for what reason you infiltrated Windermere Territory, but since I've encountered you, I will never let you advance another step." [[7988 塞尔托斯 angry]]
    As he spoke, a terrifying wave of energy erupted around him. The dazzling golden light made people unable to open their eyes for a moment. The red bishop's robe flapped without wind, and a golden, sacred seal rose behind him. [[7989 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ugh~" [[7990 米菈 surprised]]
    Mira stretched out her hand, feeling the obvious stinging pain when the light emanating from the sacred seal touched her skin. A hint of imperceptible surprise flickered in her dark purple demonic eyes. [[7991 旁白 surprised]]
    She could actually feel a dangerous aura from the light of this sacred seal, one that could threaten her life. [[7992 旁白 fearful]]
    "Not bad, you've finally shown some real skill." [[7993 米菈 neutral]]
    She murmured, then looked up into the eyes of the red-rorobed elder. With interest, she gently poked her delicate cheek with a finger, and thoughtfully spoke. [[7994 米菈 neutral]]
    "Known for the power of the 'Sacred Seal,' possessing extremely strong light attribute affinity, I remember seeing information about you in the Queen's intelligence report. If I'm not mistaken, your real name should be... Sertus, right?" [[7995 米菈 neutral]]
    The red-robed bishop, whose true name was revealed, immediately felt immense pressure. Facing this succubus of unknown origin, he, a dignified bishop, had no confidence in defeating her. His greatest hope, even now, was merely to force her to retreat, after all... [[7996 旁白 fearful]]
    They had already met once before! [[7997 旁白 neutral]]
    After entrusting the bishop's staff to the nun, Sertus rushed over. Near the border of Kempfa, his strong spiritual power detected an inexplicable aura wandering. Following that aura, he happened to encounter a succubus who was concealing herself and observing the battle intently. [[7998 旁白 neutral]]
    The succubus's aura was well-hidden. Sertus couldn't immediately determine her true strength, but since he had managed to get behind her, why wouldn't he take advantage of it? [[7999 旁白 neutral]]
    So, the righteous red-robed bishop launched a "just and honorable" sneak attack on the evil succubus. [[8000 旁白 neutral]]
    He had thought he was still as sharp as ever, and after so many years, taking on a small succubus would naturally be easy. But then, he almost messed up... [[8001 旁白 sad]]
    Even with a righteous sneak attack, he didn't gain the upper hand. He even briefly fell into a hallucination cast by the quick-witted succubus. If not for his rich combat experience, high spiritual power, and certain resistance to illusions, he would have probably been caught by this nameless succubus in that instant of weakness and instantly refined... [[8002 旁白 fearful]]
    Damn it! [[8003 塞尔托斯 angry]]
    When did so many skilled individuals gather in the small territory of Kempfa? [[8004 塞尔托斯 surprised]]
    Leaving aside the previous forbidden-spell level power fluctuations, how did he, a bishop at the peak of the fifth-tier, encounter a Greater Demon who could almost kick him to death like a roadside dog, as soon as he approached the border? [[8005 塞尔托斯 angry]]
    What is going on? Is the Succubus Queen personally coming out to corrupt the Empire and the Church from within? [[8006 塞尔托斯 fearful]]
    All sorts of exaggerated thoughts exploded in his mind. Sertus's back was unknowingly drenched in sweat. He wanted to tell himself it was rain, but the black smoke in the sky was instantly dispersed by the emerald divine light. The rain didn't have time to fall, but his soaked red robe was an undeniable fact. [[8007 旁白 fearful]]
    "Succubus! Leave now, and I can pretend I saw nothing. If you remain stubborn, then I will accompany you to the very end. But you must think carefully; this is the territory of the Church and the Empire. Once time drags on, and the Holy Crusaders surround this place, you won't be able to leave even if you want to!" [[8008 塞尔托斯 angry]]
    Even under immense pressure, Sertus didn't retreat a single step. The black smoke that had previously shrouded the sky had been dispelled. The song that triggered the miracle must be the Holy Maiden's sacred hymn. The God of Wind had answered His believers' prayers, and the scales of victory had already tipped towards humanity. [[8009 旁白 neutral]]
    The advantage is mine! [[8010 塞尔托斯 happy]]
    Sertus firmly believed that as long as he didn't mess up and held back this powerful succubus of unknown origin, this would be his greatest achievement and reward for personally leading this expedition. [[8011 旁白 happy]]
    He couldn't let her approach Kempfa; the Holy Maiden was still there! [[8012 塞尔托斯 fearful]]
    His firm belief made him feel like he had gained several times his usual strength. The Holy Maiden's sacred hymn indeed provided him with a significant boost, making him feel capable of fighting a true sixth-tier opponent, if not defeating them. [[8013 旁白 neutral]]
    As for Mira, she didn't know that an old man over fifty had such rich inner thoughts. However, the reason she hadn't used her full strength from the beginning and had been delayed by this old man for so long was because she had already obtained what she wanted—the whereabouts of the Princess. [[8014 旁白 neutral]]
    Her enhanced demonic eyes allowed her to clearly observe all changes on the battlefield from tens of thousands of meters away. The moment the battle erupted, she had already detected a faint aura of her own kind in the air. It wasn't until the blue-haired girl reflected multiple forms that she truly confirmed the other party's identity. [[8015 旁白 neutral]]
    Unexpectedly, among humans, the most mysterious Water Saintess was actually Her Majesty the Queen's youngest daughter! [[8016 旁白 surprised]]
    This matter would be explosive news whether in the Demon Realm or the Human Empire and the Church. Humans often held the idea that those not of their race harbored ill intentions. If they truly knew that the proxies of the gods they worshipped had become dirty demons, many devout believers would probably doubt their lives on the spot. [[8017 旁白 neutral]]
    Of course, if this matter were in the Demon Race, His Majesty the Demon King would be very happy to see it, after all, this matter was orchestrated by her. Other Greater Demons might not know, but their own Queen would probably pop champagne on the spot out of joy. [[8018 旁白 happy]]
    Her own daughter becoming a Saintess was simply a stroke of divine fortune! [[8019 旁白 happy]]
    In the future, humans would no longer be able to attack the Demon Race with the argument that there are no true gods among their deities. If even Saintesses are demons, doesn't that explain the problem? [[8020 旁白 neutral]]
    Moreover, the Princess's identity seems to be more than just a Saintess... [[8021 旁白 neutral]]
    However, these are matters to consider later. The most important thing now is how to safely bring the Princess back to the Demon Realm and hand her over to the Queen. The Princess has many identities, and she probably wouldn't willingly return home with her. [[8022 旁白 neutral]]
    Should she use force? [[8023 米菈 neutral]]
    She had witnessed the Princess's strength firsthand. Although she was a sixth-tier demon, the outcome of a fight to the death between them was uncertain. [[8024 旁白 fearful]]
    So... [[8025 旁白 neutral]]
    "Old man, I won't kill you today. I'll spare your life. For that, wouldn't it be fair to take some reward from you?" [[8026 米菈 neutral]]
    A carved dagger spun between Mira's fingers. Sertus's mouth twitched. Before, she had been calling him "old sir," making him mistakenly think she was a polite succubus. But in the blink of an eye, her true nature was revealed, and she called him "old man." [[8027 旁白 angry]]
    "Dream on! Clerics will never make any deals with you demons." [[8028 塞尔托斯 angry]]
    Dazzling golden patterns spread out at his feet. Sertus had decided to fight this sixth-tier succubus to the bitter end. With such a huge commotion here, the Church headquarters would surely dispatch reinforcements immediately. As long as the Holy Crusaders surrounded this place, even a sixth-tier succubus would have no escape! [[8029 旁白 angry]]
    As for the time spent waiting for reinforcements, he, a dignified red-robed bishop, an old-timer at the peak of the fifth-tier, shouldn't be instantly killed by a sixth-tier demon, right? Probably... [[8030 旁白 fearful]]
    Sertus actually had no confidence in his heart, but since he had encountered her, he had to face it head-on. [[8031 旁白 neutral]]
    "Since you're unwilling, then I can only..." [[8032 米菈 neutral]]
    Sertus had already gathered all his concentration. He was ready to deal with all the mysterious succubus's attack methods. Then, his vision twisted, like a drunkard who had too much to drink. He felt as if the entire world's frame was shaking in irregular arcs, and the purple-haired succubus's figure even transformed into scattered violet petals. [[8033 旁白 surprised]]
    Oh no! [[8034 塞尔托斯 fearful]]
    Sertus, rich in combat experience, immediately realized something was wrong. He had fallen into an illusion. He immediately bit his tongue to stimulate the magic power in his body. Under the dual awakening of physical and mental stimulation, the feeling of drunkenness finally disappeared, but the succubus he had been staring at intently had truly vanished. [[8035 旁白 fearful]]
    "Damn it!" [[8036 塞尔托斯 angry]]
    Among demons, aside from their proficiency in bedroom arts, succubi were most famous for their illusions. He had truly experienced it today, stumbling twice in one day! [[8037 旁白 angry]]
    However, although the succubus had fled, she didn't seem to escape in the direction of Kempfa. Was she intimidated by his words and chose to temporarily retreat after weighing the pros and cons? [[8038 旁白 surprised]]
    Sertus was thinking when he suddenly frowned, revealing a pained expression. A stinging pain from his soul made him feel as if his brain had suffered a heavy blow. He turned his head and saw that a corner of the "Sacred Seal" that had risen behind him was missing! [[8039 旁白 surprised]]
    Looking at the missing corner, it was as if someone had forcibly broken off a small piece with their bare hands! [[8040 旁白 surprised]]
    Sertus immediately gritted his teeth in anger. This accursed demon, stealing his "Sacred Seal"! The "Sacred Seal" was not an item; it was a special symbol he had condensed through years of devout faith and a deep understanding of light magic. [[8041 旁白 angry]]
    To him, the Sacred Seal was like a special medal of honor, a unique glory he had obtained through his own ability and talent. The Sacred Seal had an extraordinarily strong restraining and suppressing effect against demons, and it was precisely because of this that he had secured his position as a red-robed bishop. [[8042 旁白 neutral]]
    He never imagined that one day, a succubus would neither rob him of his wealth nor his body, but instead forcibly snatch a small piece of his Sacred Seal! [[8043 旁白 sad]]
    His heart was bleeding. He wanted to replenish it, but it would require a lot of effort again. [[8044 旁白 sad]]
    This personal expedition was a huge loss!!! [[8045 旁白 sad]]
    ... [[8046 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[8047 旁白 neutral]]
    "Miss..." [[8048 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella held Serafina's hand, her golden-brown eyes filled with reluctance. [[8049 旁白 sad]]
    "I'm sorry, Isabella. With my current ability, this is already the best option." [[8050 塞莱斯特 sad]]
    Celeste spoke with an apologetic tone. At the same time, she looked at Serafina. Serafina, with her golden hair and red eyes, had lost a bit of her gentleness compared to her human days and had gained more of an exotic charm and elegance. [[8051 旁白 neutral]]
    One could only say that she was worthy of being a Blood Kin, a race that had elegance carved into their bones. Although their elegance was somewhat pathological, their facial features and aesthetics were still very appealing. [[8052 旁白 neutral]]
    "Serafina, are you willing to follow Miss Lobelia for a period of time? During this time, you need to assist and help her wholeheartedly, just as you would me, and Miss Lobelia will guarantee your safety." [[8053 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    "I am willing." [[8054 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Serafina, resurrected from the dead, nodded obediently. She understood her mistress's difficulties. As a newly ascended Saintess, young and with low support, the internal affairs of the Wind Church had long been critical of her position. [[8055 旁白 neutral]]
    Even though her song and graceful demeanor in saving the villagers had been witnessed by many this time, and she would likely gain widespread public support in the future, the high-ranking officials of the Church were not ordinary people and were not easily placated. Her escape from the Thorn Curse was already linked to the power of the Blood Kin. If a Blood Kin nun, who was also her former confidante, suddenly appeared by her side at this time, it would inevitably have a huge impact on her. [[8056 旁白 neutral]]
    Therefore, the best solution was to fake Serafina's death, and her true self would follow Her Highness, the Water Saintess. After all, the Water Saintess's situation was special, she would not have too much interaction with the Church, and she also possessed Blood Kin power, making her the best candidate for this trust. [[8057 旁白 neutral]]
    "Since you agree, then follow me." [[8058 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Lobelia had no objections. Anyway, after this incident, Kempfa Town was definitely not a place to stay. No, not just Kempfa Town. For safety's sake, it would be safest for her to leave Windermere Territory directly and head to other territories under the jurisdiction of other Saintesses. Although having one more person during the escape would increase the risk of being discovered, the reward offered by Celeste truly tempted her. [[8059 旁白 neutral]]
    Even if she didn't care for the reward, for the sake of the Wind Saintess and Isabella, she had to help with this. Moreover, her escape would clearly not be a short-term affair, and having someone to accompany her, chat with, and relieve boredom along the way would be very necessary. [[8060 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing that there were no major objections from either side, Celeste also breathed a sigh of relief. Finally, she took something out of her pocket. Looking closely, it was like a jade token carved from some precious jade, but it contained an extremely pure divine essence of wind. [[8061 旁白 neutral]]
    "What is this?" [[8062 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
    Isabella asked, confused and curious. [[8063 旁白 neutral]]
    "With this token, as long as you encounter Church forces within the Windermere Territory, you can take it out. Seeing this token is like seeing the Saintess. If you encounter any trouble, you can use this token to gain help or resolve the trouble." [[8064 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    "This is a small token of my appreciation, and also a promise to Your Excellency Lobelia. As long as I live and remain in the position of the Wind Saintess, I will never forget your kindness to me." [[8065 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Lobelia said no polite words, nodded, and accepted the token. [[8066 旁白 neutral]]
    Politeness was completely unnecessary. Although it was also for self-atonement, helping the Wind Saintess was a fact, and she indeed needed this jade token during her escape. [[8067 旁白 neutral]]
    So, in the days to come, would she have to live like she used to, on the run again? [[8068 旁白 sad]]
