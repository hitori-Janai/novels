Chapter 140: Solitary Man and Woman [[8989 旁白 angry]]
"So, on my second day in the city, a new novice nun is to be assigned to me?" [[8990 塞伦安 surprised]]
Inside the clean and bright reception room, the young man in white priestly robes couldn't control his emotions for a moment. He slapped the table and stood up, looking shocked. [[8991 旁白 surprised]]
"Father Andrew, please sit down and speak calmly~ Don't be alarmed~" [[8992 泰勒 neutral]]
Across the table, a white-haired priest in purple robes smiled and waved his hand, signaling Andrew to sit down first. [[8993 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, I apologize, Father Taylor, I was rude just now." [[8994 塞伦安 neutral]]
Realizing his impropriety, Selen An quickly sat back in his original seat, adjusting his mood slightly. [[8995 旁白 neutral]]
Calm... and collected... calm... and collected my foot! [[8996 旁白 angry]]
How could he be calm in this situation?! [[8997 旁白 angry]]
He had just moved into the Rock Cathedral, and now someone was telling him that in this land blessed by the God of Rock, a devout girl was about to join the church. The key was that she didn't worship the God of Rock, but the God of Wind! [[8998 旁白 surprised]]
Father Taylor, white-haired and highly respected, seemed to understand Selen An's unease. His face still held a serene smile. [[8999 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh heh, I can understand Father Andrew's feelings. This kind of thing is indeed rare in our Giant Rock City, but from a procedural perspective, there's nothing wrong. We've checked Miss Emily's civilian information. She was born in a small village near Giant Rock City. Her parents died of plague, and she was an orphan from a young age, raised by the villagers..." [[9000 泰勒 neutral]]
"As for faith, Father Andrew, there's nothing to be shocked about. Since we welcome your arrival, we naturally accept believers of other true deities. Although Ainwell territory isn't as free as Windermere, in the land witnessed by the God of Time, we respect the choices of every legal citizen." [[9001 泰勒 neutral]]
The white-haired Father Taylor placed one hand on his chest, his voice serene and benevolent, inspiring respect in anyone who heard it. [[9002 旁白 neutral]]
But just saying that, Selen An was still a bit unable to accept it for a moment, after all, the probability of this happening was too small, right? [[9003 旁白 confused]]
Yes, he had moved into the Rock Cathedral in the name of the Wind God's priest, claiming he wanted to develop more Wind God believers in this land protected by the Rock God. But this was ultimately just a formality and lip service. In reality, could it be true?! [[9004 旁白 confused]]
Selen An's true purpose wasn't to take advantage of the Rock Cathedral's vast resources, making it difficult for them to refuse him, an "insider" from afar, even though they worshiped different gods. After all, they were both recognized true believers by the Church, so no one could discriminate against anyone else— [[9005 旁白 neutral]]
In short, Selen An just wanted to freeload off the Rock Cathedral's protection. With the two natural protective layers of clergy status and the cathedral, he and Seraphina could safely stay in this holy place and wait for the situation in Windermere to calm down. [[9006 旁白 neutral]]
What? You said slacking off is shameful, and a devout priest should strive to develop Wind God believers in this foreign land? [[9007 旁白 angry]]
Come on, this kind of grandiose reason sounds fake, okay? [[9008 旁白 angry]]
Would anyone truly believe that in a land protected by the Rock God's divine power for thousands of years, someone could, by themselves, change the local people's indigenous faith and make them turn to worship other true gods? [[9009 旁白 angry]]
Oh dear~ this is very difficult~ [[9010 旁白 sad]]
Even if there really were people in Giant Rock City who sincerely believed in the God of Wind, under the influence of the general environment and mainstream faith, ordinary people would at most place a symbolic idol at home for worship. This was already the limit a devout believer could do... [[9011 旁白 neutral]]
So, which good person would openly go to the Rock God's church to apply for conversion while believing in the Wind God?! [[9012 旁白 angry]]
This clearly isn't normal! [[9013 旁白 angry]]
At this moment, Selen An felt his mind overflowing with complaints, but due to his identity, he could only close his mouth and endure. [[9014 旁白 neutral]]
"Father Taylor, I generally understand the situation you described, but could you let me meet this girl first?" [[9015 塞伦安 neutral]]
Realizing something was wrong, Selen An changed his approach. [[9016 旁白 neutral]]
"It is a great fortune to meet someone with the same faith in this foreign land, but faith is not a trivial matter. Once one chooses to serve a certain deity, it cannot be changed. This is the land of the Rock God after all. I heard Father Taylor just described that the young lady about to join the church is only fifteen or sixteen years old. Young people are prone to impulse, and I am worried that she will regret making this choice later..." [[9017 塞伦安 neutral]]
"So please let me meet this young lady first. If she is truly sincere and firmly chooses to believe in the God of Wind, then her initiation ceremony should be performed by me." [[9018 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An's words were extremely well-spoken, logical, and thorough, with hardly any flaws. [[9019 旁白 neutral]]
Father Taylor couldn't help but nod in agreement, but he still chuckled as he nodded. [[9020 旁白 neutral]]
"Father Taylor, is there something wrong with what I said?" [[9021 塞伦安 confused]]
Selen An was extremely puzzled. His previous statement had considered almost everything that needed to be considered. Had he missed any key information? Made a fool of himself? [[9022 旁白 confused]]
"No, no, no, just based on what you said earlier, I know that Father Selen An is a young talent. As for why I laughed just now, it's because you're too worried~" [[9023 泰勒 neutral]]
"Too worried?" [[9024 塞伦安 surprised]]
The young man felt increasingly uneasy as he listened, and the white-haired old man's smile seemed to hold deeper meaning. [[9025 旁白 neutral]]
"Haha, Miss Emily's faith is so devout and her resolve so firm that you don't need to worry. After all, you haven't seen it, her devout light of faith is almost overflowing." [[9026 泰勒 happy]]
Light, almost overflowing? [[9027 旁白 surprised]]
Selen An's mouth finally twitched uncontrollably, imperceptibly. [[9028 旁白 surprised]]
"Don't believe me? Come, I'll take you to witness it with your own eyes now." [[9029 泰勒 happy]]
Father Taylor's gaze was subtle, and he said no more, rising and walking out. [[9030 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An followed, but in his heart, he still thought: [[9031 旁白 neutral]]
This exaggerated rhetoric is a bit too much, isn't it? [[9032 旁白 neutral]]
If Miss Emily, whom he had never met, was truly so devout that light was overflowing from her, he would immediately go to the outhouse and eat several mouthfuls... [[9033 旁白 angry]]
... [[9034 旁白 neutral]]
... [[9035 旁白 neutral]]
Damn it, it really overflowed! [[9036 旁白 surprised]]
Following Father Taylor to another enclosed confessional, as the wooden door of the confessional opened, Selen An felt his vision filled with holy light, and his mouth widened into an O shape. [[9037 旁白 surprised]]
Nuts! [[9038 旁白 angry]]
He had just been thinking that Father Taylor must have eaten a few peanuts and drunk a few catties of wine in the morning to be so drunk as to boast like this, but reality slapped him hard—the light really overflowed! [[9039 旁白 surprised]]
Oh, by the Wind God! [[9040 旁白 surprised]]
Why was this drunkard so lucky to draw an SSR on someone else's territory as his first card? [[9041 旁白 angry]]
Indeed, the confessional was small and dim, with only the young girl sitting on the bench emitting an incredible glow. [[9042 旁白 neutral]]
The chestnut-haired, pretty girl bowed her head slightly, her long eyelashes casting shadows in the halo of light. Her hands were devoutly clasped in front of her knees. The holy golden light was not static, but flowed and gathered softly like a tangible substance, leaping and floating on the outline of her plain dress, even seeping out in wisps, quietly dispelling the shadows on the stone wall, immersing the entire small room in a warm, tranquil sacredness, as if she herself was a miniature altar. [[9043 旁白 neutral]]
"Truly incredible..." [[9044 塞伦安 surprised]]
Witnessing this scene, Selen An completely understood what Taylor had said earlier. What was there to worry about now?! The light of devout faith was overflowing. If such a person had been born a few years earlier, the Church's list of saints would definitely have one more entry. [[9045 旁白 neutral]]
But being so devout, why choose to believe in the God of Wind when there were other true gods? That fellow only knew how to slack off and steal leisure. Even her biggest believer, Celeste, didn't get any benefits from this deity. Instead, she had to work for nothing since childhood. [[9046 旁白 neutral]]
He muttered inwardly, and the two had already entered the confessional. Taylor also closed the door behind them. [[9047 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of the door closing seemed to awaken the praying girl. The chestnut-haired girl opened her eyes, her brown pupils showing the purity unique to a young girl. Even in her simple dress, she couldn't hide her pure and lovely demeanor. [[9048 旁白 neutral]]
"Father Taylor... and this, you must be Father Andrew, right?!" [[9049 艾米丽 surprised]]
The girl kneaded the corner of her skirt with her fingertips, looking utterly like a shy girl next door. But the blush on her cheeks only highlighted her youthful and innocent beauty, which hadn't fully blossomed yet. [[9050 旁白 neutral]]
"Haha, look, Miss Camilie recognized you at a glance. It's really good to be young, unlike an old man like me, no one would even give me a second glance if I were left by the roadside." [[9051 泰勒 happy]]
Taylor patted Selen An's shoulder, teasingly. [[9052 旁白 neutral]]
"No, no! Father Taylor is also very handsome, um, but it's the kind of handsome that inspires admiration, yes, just like that!" [[9053 艾米丽 happy]]
The little girl's face turned red, and even her words stumbled a bit, but this didn't stop her from making the old man laugh heartily. [[9054 旁白 neutral]]
Just from this brief encounter, Selen An couldn't help but sigh. Girls like this really couldn't be disliked by anyone. Honestly, thinking about this made him annoyed. Couldn't Seraphina learn from others? [[9055 旁白 angry]]
Why did she always pick on him and force him to study? He was a dignified priest being forced to study by his own nun, didn't he have any dignity? [[9056 旁白 angry]]
Indeed, later novice nuns were like junior sisters, so gentle and sweet that one couldn't refuse them. There was a reason why the white lotus junior sister from his previous life could secretly outmaneuver the vicious senior sister. Men, they just fall for this kind of thing! [[9057 旁白 neutral]]
"Father Andrew, do you think it's still necessary to examine her now?" [[9058 泰勒 neutral]]
Taylor stepped aside, allowing Andrew and Emily to face each other directly, and asked with amusement. [[9059 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm, many doubts have been resolved, but there are still some things I think it's safer to ask face-to-face." [[9060 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Do you need this old man to step aside?" [[9061 泰勒 neutral]]
"No need." [[9062 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Yes." [[9063 艾米丽 happy]]
Two completely different answers made Father Taylor's face show a hint of surprise, and then, that meaningful auntie-like smile returned. He looked at the girl whose fingers were almost rubbing through the corner of her skirt, her shy face as red as a ripe apple. [[9064 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, I was a gentleman in my youth, so I naturally understand the etiquette of deferring to ladies, Father Andrew, I'll leave it to you now." [[9065 泰勒 happy]]
"Father Taylor, wait..." [[9066 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An still wanted to hold him back, but he only heard the thud of the door closing, and the confessional fell silent once more. [[9067 旁白 neutral]]
The air was very quiet, so quiet that only the faint breathing of the young man and woman could be heard. Oh, this damn atmosphere, a solitary man and woman in one room, and in a church confessional at that. This environment always made one imagine some inappropriate scenes. [[9068 旁白 neutral]]
But who was Selen An? A young and promising priest! [[9069 旁白 neutral]]
Suppressing those evil thoughts, self-control was the most basic principle. Besides, this kind of cute, girl-next-door type would only make one feel protective, how could it possibly lead to those bad... [[9070 旁白 neutral]]
He even tried to revert to his serene state of mind when he was Lobelia, but when he turned his head, he was close to the girl's shyness, and the fluttering skirt caused by her slightly swaying body as she looked down, her oval face covered in a blush, and beneath her clear, bright autumn eyes were a pair of captivating, lustful bags under her eyes. [[9071 旁白 neutral]]
Tsk... why didn't he feel this way before? Now, the more he looked at this little girl, the more he felt that her purity was secondary. With those big eyes and small bags under her eyes, her aura instantly changed from that of a demure young lady to a pure and seductive one? [[9072 旁白 neutral]]
A fresh-faced girl instantly becoming a pure and seductive top-tier beauty? [[9073 旁白 neutral]]
The situation was getting weirder and weirder. Why was his mind starting to wander uncontrollably? [[9074 旁白 neutral]]
But the problem was, he hadn't eaten leeks or oysters last night! [[9075 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as Taylor left, the hormones in his body became increasingly restless, as if the air was mixed equally with oxygen and aphrodisiacs. [[9076 旁白 neutral]]
"Father Andrew~" [[9077 艾米丽 happy]]
The girl's call brought Selen An's consciousness back largely. At this moment, he suddenly realized that his breathing had become incredibly heavy at some point. [[9078 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, the girl didn't seem to notice his lapse, and continued to shyly lower her head, her voice seemingly carrying a hint of coquetry. [[9079 旁白 neutral]]
"I apologize, I was a bit distracted just now." [[9080 塞伦安 neutral]]
"It's nothing, I just wanted to ask, if I join the church, would Father Andrew be willing to personally conduct my initiation ceremony?" [[9081 艾米丽 neutral]]
Emily spoke shyly, like a young bride about to enter the wedding hall. [[9082 旁白 neutral]]
"Of course, if you believe in the God of Wind, it is indeed most appropriate for me to conduct your initiation ceremony here at the Rock Cathedral." [[9083 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An tried to keep his voice calm and normal, but his body didn't cooperate. His blood felt hot, as if it was slowly being cooked by fire. His Adam's apple moved, and he swallowed frequently. [[9084 旁白 neutral]]
Damn it, was the confessional in the Rock Cathedral so poorly ventilated? It felt much worse than the one in Kempfer. He felt as hot as if he were in a sauna! [[9085 旁白 angry]]
But strangely, even though the situation was so abnormal, Selen An always attributed the problem to himself and the environment, never suspecting whether this abnormality came from the only other person in the room besides himself... [[9086 旁白 neutral]]
And opposite him, the shy girl looking down, the purity and clarity that had been there before were gone from her eyes, half-hidden by her bangs. Instead, there was a continuous stream of lust and pleasure, like a lingering mist. [[9087 旁白 neutral]]
Don't suppress it anymore, release your desires, Your Highness~ [[9088 米菈 neutral]]
