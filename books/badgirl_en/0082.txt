Chapter 82: Belenena [[4650 旁白 neutral]]
    "Sister, I'm here." [[4651 陌生女1 neutral]]
    Following that voice, another "Serenia" stood at the door. [[4652 旁白 neutral]]
    If Anna hadn't spent a long time with Serenia, she might have thought so too, as the two were indeed too similar in appearance. Apart from minor details and differences in temperament, they were almost carved from the same mold. [[4653 旁白 neutral]]
    However, unexpectedly, these sisters were not full-blooded siblings, but half-sisters. One could only say that the Saintess's bloodline was truly too powerful, leaving nothing to be said about its genetic inheritance of appearance. [[4654 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, having been by the Saintess's side for four years, Anna had also summarized a small experience: the younger sister, Belenena, had a tear mole under her left eye, while a closer look at the Saintess's pupils would reveal a faint snowflake mark. [[4655 旁白 neutral]]
    So, the person Her Royal Highness entrusted this time was Miss Belenena? [[4656 旁白 surprised]]
    Anna was a bit surprised. Although from her personal perspective, the relationship between Her Royal Highness the Saintess and Miss Belenena was quite good, the rumors in the Church about their relationship were not so harmonious. [[4657 旁白 neutral]]
    Imagine, one was a young lady once considered ominous by the family and almost abandoned, while the other was regarded as a genius by the family elders, even being groomed as the successor Saintess. Not only were their statuses and treatments vastly different, but their strengths were incomparable. But then one day... [[4658 旁白 neutral]]
    The "useless" young lady blossomed with an unstoppable brilliance, swiftly securing the position of Saintess with her absolute talent and strength. And what about the second young lady, who was once the Saintess's successor? [[4659 旁白 neutral]]
    With the Saintess already in her place, who would still care about a former Saintess candidate? Even many elders in the family who supported the second young lady had given up. [[4660 旁白 neutral]]
    From being the center of attention to being ignored by everyone, from a normal person's perspective, their relationship would certainly not be good. This was why the rumors within the Church about their relationship were so negative. But was it really true? [[4661 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps the true answer was only known to these two sisters themselves. [[4662 旁白 neutral]]
    But at least now, Her Royal Highness was willing to entrust such an important matter to Miss Belenena, indicating that their relationship was definitely not as bad as the rumors suggested. [[4663 旁白 neutral]]
    "Sister." [[4664 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    Serenia nodded, her smile faint, but those familiar with the past Ice Saintesses knew that Ice Saintesses were generally icebergs, and it was already very difficult to make them smile. [[4665 旁白 neutral]]
    "I apologize for calling you here amidst your busy schedule. I'm afraid it will delay your study of magic." [[4666 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    "No, magic can be studied anytime. Sister rarely calls me with such urgency, so of course I had to come." [[4667 陌生女2 neutral]]
    Their conversation was calm, but the meaning conveyed in their words was genuine sisterly affection. [[4668 旁白 neutral]]
    "This time I asked you to come for something..." [[4669 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    With that, Serenia pointed to the small circle on the map and repeated the matter she wanted to entrust in detail. [[4670 旁白 neutral]]
    Anna stood by, not saying a word, as quiet as a decoration. [[4671 旁白 neutral]]
    Belenena, on the other hand, stared very seriously at the circled location on the map, her right index finger and thumb lightly rubbing her chin, lost in thought. [[4672 旁白 neutral]]
    "If I'm not mistaken, the location within this circle is near the two major cities in the southwestern interior of the Empire, Roland City and Jingtie City. If we were to secretly search within this range, it would definitely take a lot of time." [[4673 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    Her voice was clear and cold, just like Serenia's, but with a hint of a girl's softness in her tone. [[4674 旁白 neutral]]
    "And after all, four years have passed. Although I still remember how young Master Selen An looked when he was younger, there's no guarantee he looks the same now, after all..." [[4675 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "No need to worry." [[4676 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    Serenia shook her head. With a flick of her hand, a carefully sealed and preserved scroll appeared out of thin air in her palm. [[4677 旁白 neutral]]
    The scroll was unfurled, and the person in the painting was a stunning girl with long, sea-blue hair. [[4678 旁白 neutral]]
    Upon seeing the girl's appearance in the painting, Belenena subconsciously held her breath, and Anna, who happened to witness it for the second time, still couldn't suppress the surge in her heart. [[4679 旁白 neutral]]
    She believed that anyone who witnessed the true appearance of Her Royal Highness the Saintess would, for a short or long moment, become lost in her beauty and temperament. She was truly too pure, as pure as the clearest water in this world, without a single impurity. [[4680 旁白 neutral]]
    Belenena was no exception. Her beautiful eyes were fixed on the painting, refusing to move. After a long time, she finally moved her gaze with difficulty, looking at Serenia with somewhat complex emotions. [[4681 旁白 neutral]]
    "So, this is the current Water Saintess?" [[4682 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "Yes." [[4683 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    "I know you always worry about her, Sister, but since you are so eager to find her, why not make this painting public? That way, if anyone happens to see her, we could get news faster." [[4684 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "Do you believe it?" [[4685 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    "What?" [[4686 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    Belenena tilted her head, a little puzzled. [[4687 旁白 neutral]]
    "Do you believe that the girl in the painting is the Selen An you once knew?" [[4688 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    Serenia's question caused a moment of silence in the room. Even Anna held her breath. [[4689 旁白 neutral]]
    "I do. Although it goes against common sense, I believe it." [[4690 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    After a long time, Belenena nodded. [[4691 旁白 neutral]]
    "As you said, most people's thinking and logic operate according to common sense. Even if I were to make this painting public, not many people would believe that this is Selen An. Even the Church is the same; after all, the Church internally still harbors doubts about whether Selen An is alive, and some foolish people among them even attribute the miracle that occurred in Craigmore to divine favor." [[4692 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    "Moreover, if this painting were to be made public, there would also be ill-intentioned people who would exploit it. A Saintess family that has existed for a thousand years, you and I should be very clear about how much corruption and filth are hidden within the family." [[4693 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    Serenia didn't say it explicitly, but the intelligent Belenena immediately understood the meaning behind her words. [[4694 旁白 neutral]]
    "I understand." [[4695 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    The girl nodded and took the rolled-up painting her sister handed her. [[4696 旁白 neutral]]
    There was little more conversation between the two sisters. Belenena turned to leave, but just then, Serenia spoke again. [[4697 旁白 neutral]]
    "May I ask what you are thinking?" [[4698 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    "Sister, which one do you want to ask about?" [[4699 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    Belenena stopped, but didn't turn around. [[4700 旁白 neutral]]
    "Why do you believe that the girl in the painting is the Selen An who used to be so wicked? A boy turning into a girl, such a thing should be absurd, especially a notorious young master becoming a Saintess." [[4701 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    "That's just what outsiders think..." [[4702 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "As I said before, according to common sense, I shouldn't believe it, but my past experiences and memories tell me that someone who can make Sister reborn from the ashes must also be an extraordinary person." [[4703 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "So I believe he is Selen An, just as I once believed you would become the true Saintess after seeing you bravely face yourself under that person's encouragement." [[4704 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    The door closed, and silence fell over the room. [[4705 旁白 neutral]]
    "Miss Belenena is truly a person with her own strong opinions." [[4706 安娜 neutral]]
    Anna quietly spoke. [[4707 旁白 neutral]]
    Serenia looked at the closed door and smiled gently. [[4708 旁白 happy]]
    "She has always seen things clearly, ever since she was little, it's always been like that." [[4709 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
    "That's why I entrusted this matter to her. I believe she will also be able to recognize the extraordinary him amidst the vast crowd." [[4710 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
