Chapter 135: The Second Round Table Conference [[8477 旁白 neutral]]
“We failed, we completely failed…” [[8478 旁白 sad]]
“Do you know why we failed?” [[8479 旁白 neutral]]
It was still that dark and grand palace, still filled with cold blue demonic flames, and still a meeting held at that round table. The only difference from last time was that the number of attendees had changed from four to three. [[8480 旁白 neutral]]
The skeletal bull-headed Archdemon, with fire on his head, still sat at the head of the table. He looked down at his two fellow demons below and the empty seat, a wicked moon seemingly rotating in his hollow eye sockets. [[8481 旁白 neutral]]
The snake-haired Medusa's gaze drifted, as if this meeting had little to do with her. The Raven-headed one was a new face, but the pair of retracted white angel wings on his back seemed a bit out of place with the black feathers on his head. [[8482 旁白 neutral]]
“Because she, a Water Saintess, didn't learn healing magic, but instead learned destructive forbidden curses!” [[8483 旁白 angry]]
Seeing that his subordinates gave no response, Agares slammed the table in anger and roared in a deep voice. [[8484 旁白 angry]]
“Medusa, do you have anything to say about this failure?” [[8485 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
“Me?” [[8486 美杜莎 surprised]]
Medusa, suddenly called upon, twisted her alluring figure, and her eerie green eyes rolled. [[8487 旁白 neutral]]
“What can I say? That Vlad guy was so confident before he set out, telling us to watch him work. I even thought he might actually kidnap the Windermere family's Saintess, but it turns out…” [[8488 美杜莎 sarcastic]]
“Men truly can't be relied upon. How can you expect someone who likes to hide in the shadows to accomplish anything significant?” [[8489 美杜莎 sarcastic]]
When it came to being sarcastic and cynical, Medusa had always held considerable authority in the demon world. [[8490 旁白 neutral]]
“Andros, what do you think?” [[8491 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
Agares had no intention of stopping Medusa's sharp remarks. After all, a loser had no right to argue, and Vlad was already dead, dying in a particularly pathetic way. [[8492 旁白 neutral]]
He merely turned his gaze to the new colleague who had just joined the “project team.” [[8493 旁白 neutral]]
“Agares, I’m not very familiar with your previous plan, but from the outcome, Vlad’s death was utterly without honor. Both the sudden awakening of the Water Saintess and the Wind Saintess breaking free from control illustrate that we shouldn't focus all our energy and attention on those six women favored by the gods.” [[8494 安朵斯 neutral]]
Unlike the hoarse or muffled tones of other demons, this Raven-headed Archdemon with an angelic body spoke eloquently, his voice overly serene and calm, as if it contained some kind of order. [[8495 旁白 neutral]]
Agares remained silent, and Andros continued to express his views. [[8496 旁白 neutral]]
“His Majesty the Demon King’s decree is important, but everything requires a gradual approach, it needs to be methodical and orderly, not like Vlad who suddenly had an impulse and desire in his mind and immediately acted on it. The results are often not too good…” [[8497 安朵斯 neutral]]
“What you said makes sense.” [[8498 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
Agares nodded, speaking in a low, buzzing voice. [[8499 旁白 neutral]]
“The matter of the Saintesses cannot be rushed. If we want to bring them under our control, we must plan carefully for the long term.” [[8500 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
The two failures of Kogas and Vlad instantly sobered up the Archdemons. The Saintesses were not lambs to be slaughtered; although they appeared delicate and pitiable on the surface, they were, in fact, all exceptionally clever. [[8501 旁白 neutral]]
To break down the alliance of the Saintesses, they would undoubtedly need to rely on the power of demonic corruption, focusing on psychological warfare. But how could it be that easy? [[8502 旁白 neutral]]
Ordinary people are easily tempted to fall, because their hearts are not pure or firm. With just a little incitement of their inner desires, one can naturally witness the birth of a new demon. But Saintesses are different—those girls with divine blood flowing through them are, after all, chosen representatives of the true gods themselves. Strong will and devout faith are basic requirements, and with the protection of divine blessings, it is very difficult to corrupt them demonically. [[8503 旁白 neutral]]
“In my opinion, ultimately, the assimilation ability of the Vampires is too weak. Why do they insist on some ‘First Embrace’ just to turn a human? When asked, their reply is that elegant nobles must have a sense of ritual. To hell with their sense of ritual!” [[8504 美杜莎 angry]]
“Isn’t efficiency what matters in such matters? When it comes to assimilation ability, the Succubus Clan truly has the most say. It’s just a pity…” [[8505 美杜莎 neutral]]
Medusa's previously excited words suddenly stopped, and silence fell around them. [[8506 旁白 neutral]]
“Ahem, Satila is also an old Archdemon. As the Queen of the Succubus Clan, she must have unique insights into this. It’s just that ever since His Majesty ascended to the throne, she, who used to act without restraint, has reined herself in a lot. It might not be easy to get her to act.” [[8507 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
Agares also rarely cleared his throat twice. [[8508 旁白 neutral]]
In the field of demonic corruption, Succubi are indeed experts. Things like Illusion Corruption, Silver Mark Corruption, Collapse Corruption, Chain Corruption… these were all developed by the Succubus Clan. In terms of efficiency, the Vampires' First Embrace is child's play in comparison. [[8509 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, the First Embrace also has its advantages, which is that the embracer has absolute control over the embraced. In this regard alone, the ordinary demonic corruption that the Succubus Clan excels at is indeed lacking. [[8510 旁白 neutral]]
“Satila?” [[8511 安朵斯 neutral]]
Andros suddenly interjected. [[8512 旁白 neutral]]
“Regarding that woman, I vaguely sensed something unusual about her a few days ago. Besides the Five Great Succubus Chiefs, Satila has stayed quietly in her territory for many years, but recently, she seems to have made a move. As for her purpose, it’s unknown.” [[8513 安朵斯 neutral]]
“Oh, that piece of information is useful.” [[8514 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
Agares’s hollow eyes brightened, and the flames burned more intensely. [[8515 旁白 neutral]]
“I remember Satila’s eldest daughter was born from her union with Madurian. If she’s been active recently, then perhaps by leveraging her relationship with Madurian, we could…” [[8516 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
“Wait, where is Madurian?” [[8517 阿加雷斯 surprised]]
The “Flaming Minotaur” just realized that a seat was still empty at the four-person round table conference. Andros had replaced Vlad, but Madurian, who was supposed to be there, was nowhere to be seen. [[8518 旁白 neutral]]
“That guy went into hibernation. He asked me to tell you that he’s taking leave.” [[8519 美杜莎 neutral]]
Medusa flicked her snake-headed long hair, reminding him at the opportune moment. [[8520 旁白 neutral]]
“Hibernation? What kind of joke is this?! He, a grand Archdemon, needs to hibernate?” [[8521 阿加雷斯 angry]]
“Agares, don’t yell at me. Those were his exact words. Snakes need to hibernate, so it’s perfectly fine for him, a great snake with the divine blood of the Serpent Demon God flowing through him, to hibernate.” [[8522 美杜莎 angry]]
“Damn it, after this meeting, I’m going to drag that stinking worm out of his hole!” [[8523 阿加雷斯 angry]]
Agares made no attempt to hide his rage. Madurian’s actions had clearly challenged his authority. If he, a dignified Moon Demon God, couldn't even control a Serpent Demon God, then he might as well give up his position as second-in-command. [[8524 旁白 angry]]
“In short, let’s put this matter aside for now. Previously, to silently send Vlad into the heart of the Empire, many of our pieces stationed along the imperial border were removed. It’s not advisable to make any further plans targeting the Saintesses in the short term.” [[8525 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
Seemingly having calmed down, Agares made the first decision of this meeting. [[8526 旁白 neutral]]
“As for our next objective during this time, I believe both of you already know what it is, right?” [[8527 阿加雷斯 neutral]]
“Of course, those long-eared ones who have occupied the buffer zone for years still refuse to withdraw. Since they don’t want to leave, then let them stay there forever with their Sacred Tree~” [[8528 美杜莎 happy]]
Clearly, Agares had already communicated with Medusa beforehand. This snake-haired gorgon, burdened with a terrible curse, was eager to inflict a devastating blow upon those troublesome long-eared ones. [[8529 旁白 neutral]]
“Don’t the Elves always pride themselves on their longevity? Then let me see, whose lifespan is truly longer? Or perhaps the lucky ones who are turned into stone by me will be less prone to decay.” [[8530 美杜莎 happy]]

Inside the inn, as the first ray of morning sunlight shone through the gap into the room, it happened to fall on the golden-haired elf girl's cheek. Her slender golden eyelashes trembled slightly until her hazy eyes opened. Wendy, getting up from the table, rubbed her still-sleepy eyes, and after seeing the sunlight outside the window, she suddenly shivered. [[8533 旁白 neutral]]
Wait… it’s daytime now? [[8534 温蒂尼 surprised]]
She had checked into the room at night, and now it was bright and sunny outside. This meant she had slept on the table for an entire night! [[8535 旁白 surprised]]
She had actually fallen asleep while praying to the great Goddess of Light! [[8536 旁白 surprised]]
This was an unforgivable sin! She, she, did this count as blasphemy? [[8537 温蒂尼 fearful]]
Having never made a mistake in her life, Wendy encountered something like this for the first time. For a moment, she was flustered and at a loss, but just as she had thought about how to atone to the Goddess, a warmth in her hand suddenly made her clear-headed. [[8538 旁白 neutral]]
Opening her palm, the pendant with the mini gem sword still lay quietly there. Only, in the center of the originally transparent gem material, a hint of orange candle flame seemed to be lit, and the warmth in her hand came from this. [[8539 旁白 neutral]]
Wendy felt that her brain had been stimulated in some way, and her pupils widened. Last night's slumber was not a dreamless sleep; she had dreamed, and in her dream, she saw two strangers she had never seen before, one with golden hair and one with blue hair, sitting by a campfire, seemingly discussing something… [[8540 旁白 surprised]]
Her memory wasn't very clear, but upon waking from the dream, she was surprisingly able to clearly remember the last sentence of their conversation at the end of the dream— [[8541 旁白 neutral]]
“Then it’s settled, the next stop will temporarily be Giant Rock City.” [[8542 旁白 neutral]]
Giant Rock City, this was also considered a famous city in the human empire, and its geographical location happened to be in the territory of the Rock Saintess, the Ainville territory. [[8543 旁白 neutral]]
Why did she suddenly have such a dream? [[8544 温蒂尼 surprised]]
More and more scenes were infinitely close to reality. If her brain had just conjured them up, it would be too unreasonable. [[8545 温蒂尼 neutral]]
Could it be a prophetic dream? [[8546 温蒂尼 surprised]]
But she didn't have the bloodline of a witch. She was a pure-blooded golden elf, and neither her bloodline talent nor the magic she learned had ever included abilities related to divination or the future. [[8547 温蒂尼 neutral]]
Wait… [[8548 温蒂尼 surprised]]
Wendy suddenly frowned. A scene in her dream seemed to make her remember something. Gathered around the campfire, the firelight illuminated the faces of the two unfamiliar girls, and one of the blue-haired girls, her pupils seemed to be exceptionally special water-drop pupils. [[8549 旁白 neutral]]
Before she left, her mother seemed to have said that one of the most distinctive features of the Water Saintess was their extremely rare water-drop pupils! [[8550 旁白 neutral]]
In other words, she dreamed of the Water Saintess whom she had never met? And through the dream, she learned the location of their next destination? [[8551 温蒂尼 surprised]]
This, this… [[8552 温蒂尼 surprised]]
The girl took two steps back in disbelief, until her heels hit the bed frame. Only then did she blankly lower her head and look at the pendant in her palm. [[8553 旁白 surprised]]
“Goddess, are you helping me?” [[8554 温蒂尼 surprised]]
The pendant didn't react, but the residual warmth on its surface seemed to be proving something. [[8555 旁白 neutral]]

Inside a rented, humble carriage. [[8558 旁白 neutral]]
“Little… no, young master, you seem to be even more beautiful than last night.” [[8559 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“I don’t need you to remind me about something like that.” [[8560 塞伦安 angry]]
Selen An rolled his eyes at Serafina across from him, helplessly turning his head away. [[8561 旁白 neutral]]
Damn it, after the conferment last night, he should have changed back to his original form as soon as possible. But because of that inexplicable昏迷, after waking up, she became as emotionally unstable as a girl who had just gotten her period. [[8562 旁白 sad]]
And then, there was the heart-to-heart talk between girls. Of course, Selen An was happy to appreciate this kind of mutual reliance between beautiful girls, but if one of them was himself, then such an encounter might be a bit unfortunate… [[8563 旁白 sad]]
How was his male body supposed to interact now? [[8564 塞伦安 sad]]
He was supposed to establish the image of an iron-hard tough guy, but last night's heart-to-heart talk completely destroyed that possibility. Plus, Serafina's recent comment—needless to say, he understood that after expending so much power to bless Serafina last night, the feminization progress bar must have surged forward again. [[8565 旁白 sad]]
Forget it, there’s no need to worry about such things. He would have to face it eventually anyway, so he might as well slowly adapt to living completely as a girl in advance… [[8566 塞伦安 neutral]]
“Young Master, this time, Giant Rock City, where we are headed, is in the territory of the Rock Saintess. Through last night’s conversation, it seems you don't have a deep enough understanding of the various Saintesses.” [[8567 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“So what? Can you give me a quick lesson on the spot?” [[8568 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An raised an eyebrow. [[8569 旁白 neutral]]
“That’s exactly what I intended.” [[8570 塞拉菲娜 happy]]
Gasp?!” [[8571 塞伦安 surprised]]
“As everyone knows, there are six positions for Saintesses in the Church, and behind these six Saintesses are six great Saintess Families. These six Saintess Families are…” [[8572 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“The Fire Saintess, who believes in the God of Fire, symbolizing war and glory, belongs to the Elvira Family.” [[8573 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“The Wind Saintess, who believes in the God of Wind, symbolizing freedom and wisdom, belongs to the Windermere Family.” [[8574 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“The Light Saintess, who believes in the God of Light, symbolizing justice and miracles, belongs to the Lunaris Family.” [[8575 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“The Rock Saintess, who believes in the God of Rock, symbolizing time and protection, belongs to the Ainville Family.” [[8576 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“The Ice Saintess, who believes in the God of Ice, symbolizing judgment and temperance, belongs to the Glacies Family.” [[8577 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“And finally, the Water Saintess, who believes in the God of Water, symbolizing life and peace, belongs to your family, the Winterlein Family.” [[8578 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“The members of the Six Great Saintess Families are all pillars within the Church, and their influence is extraordinary. Of course, the influence of the six families is not entirely equal. Among them, the Lunaris Family, to which the Light Saintess belongs, is the leading one…” [[8579 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“As for the reason, I suppose you’ve already guessed some of it, Young Master?” [[8580 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
