Chapter 75: Undercurrents [[4241 旁白 neutral]]
    That lord was an existence someone as insignificant as him could only look up to. [[4242 旁白 neutral]]
    Now, the lord's plan was to include him as a chess piece in his game, and Rex felt incredibly excited. This was not only an acknowledgment of him but also a chance for him to rise! [[4243 旁白 happy]]
    Think about it: just by participating in this plan, he was granted noble blood and promoted to Viscount. If he could assist this lord in completing his great plan, his future would have limitless possibilities. [[4244 旁白 neutral]]
    At that time, he would no longer cower in dark corners. Instead, he would wear splendid noble attire, stand among the upper echelons of the family, and with just a look or a word, countless family members or minor nobles would risk their lives for him. [[4245 旁白 neutral]]
    He yearned for such a future and was willing to give everything for it. [[4246 旁白 neutral]]
    As long as he could complete this task beautifully, from then on, even if he met Count Rose again, he would no longer be a humble Viscount trembling on the ground but an equal Count who could stand shoulder to shoulder with him! [[4247 旁白 happy]]
    Rex originally thought such a future was not far off. For a remote mountain town, he only needed to send a few trusted subordinates to sneak in, first control all the people and livestock there with marks and curses, and then use these human and animal cannon fodder to besiege the church. [[4248 旁白 neutral]]
    Due to the church's own characteristics, the clergy always hesitated when dealing with people and livestock. As long as they seized this weakness and took down the church, becoming a Count would be just around the corner. [[4249 旁白 neutral]]
    He thought it would be like this, but things did not go as smoothly as he imagined. The advance team sent out first completely lost contact after three days. He initially thought it was due to his subordinates' laziness, but even after sending out several signals, he received no response. [[4250 旁白 sad]]
    At this time, Kres had already realized that something was wrong, but he suppressed this information until five days later when he merged all his subordinates with the men and hounds the Count had given him in advance and sent them out. Only then did he struggle to inform Count Rose of the matter. [[4251 旁白 sad]]
    Even facing Count Rose's storm-like wrath, Rex did not regret his choice at all. [[4252 旁白 neutral]]
    Because this was his only chance. If even the first part went wrong and the Count found out, the Count would surely revoke his appointment along with the Duke, and look for other candidates. [[4253 旁白 fearful]]
    How could this be? How could this happen?! [[4254 雷克斯 angry]]
    The opportunity was his, Rex's, and only he could enjoy this honor. [[4255 雷克斯 neutral]]
    Since the beginning was already wrong, it was better to go all out and send the main army directly. Once the second wave of troops was dispatched, even if the Count had objections, he couldn't recall them and could only patiently wait for the results. [[4256 旁白 neutral]]
    This was a big gamble. As long as the second wave of troops successfully occupied Kempfa Town, the previous mistakes could be ignored, and the deserved rewards and glory would certainly not be lacking. [[4257 旁白 neutral]]
    But if it failed, Rex had never imagined such consequences, because it would surely be hell and a terrifying sight. But so what? [[4258 旁白 fearful]]
    He didn't believe that a small town could resist a mixed force of hundreds of vampires and ghouls. Moreover, according to calculations, the time the troops launched their attack was precisely at night. [[4259 旁白 neutral]]
    Night was the blood race's home ground. Humble humans and livestock could only pitifully cower in corners, trembling slightly, waiting for the blood race's cleansing. [[4260 旁白 neutral]]
    Furthermore, there was the "secret weapon" the Count had given him in that troop. Rex really couldn't imagine how he could lose. [[4261 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps his anger had mostly vented, Count Rose looked down at Viscount Rex, who was motionless on the ground, and snorted coldly. [[4262 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hmph, I know very well what little schemes you're playing..." [[4263 蔷薇伯爵 angry]]
    "Don't think you're the only smart one in this world. I also climbed up from your position step by step. But since you've chosen to bet like this, I'll think highly of you and try to anticipate the final result." [[4264 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    In the shadows, a tall maid appeared behind Count Rose, carrying a tray. The Count reached out and took the goblet full of crimson blood from the tray, elegantly taking a sip. [[4265 旁白 neutral]]
    "But you must remember, if you fail this time again, you'd better beg the great Cain that the Duke will let you go like a negligible fart, otherwise..." [[4266 蔷薇伯爵 fearful]]
    In an instant, the red light flashing in the darkness made Rex tremble all over. Cold sweat soaked his undershirt, and his limbs trembled uncontrollably. That feeling of life being out of his control was something he never wanted to experience a second time in his life. [[4267 旁白 fearful]]
    He suddenly regretted his choice. If, he meant if, if he lost the bet, then what would face him would be... [[4268 旁白 fearful]]
    ... [[4269 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[4270 旁白 neutral]]
    "Matthew, it's so late, why are you still wandering outside? Go back quickly!" [[4271 塞纳 neutral]]
    The town was unusually quiet tonight, not even the usual wind could be heard. But the nuns in the church were all out, contrary to common sense. Six or seven petite girls in black and white nun's habits walked through the familiar alleys, vigilantly patrolling the surroundings. [[4272 旁白 neutral]]
    Tonight, the residents had all gone to bed early. Even the occasional individual encountered on the road was persuaded by the nuns to go back early. Sena didn't expect to meet an acquaintance on the road so late. [[4273 旁白 neutral]]
    Matthew, the shabby bard with messy hair, still carried his ancestral worn-out harp, gazing at the town's entrance. [[4274 旁白 neutral]]
    "Mr. Matthew, please go back quickly, tonight..." [[4275 塞纳 neutral]]
    "Hmm, beautiful Sister, I praise your kindness, but today I cannot obey your advice and return home early. After all, as a bard, I don't want to miss any chance to witness an epic with my own eyes." [[4276 马修 neutral]]
    "What are you talking about? The town is very calm, there's nothing..." [[4277 塞纳 neutral]]
    Sena still wanted to persuade him to go back, but Matthew pointed his hand towards the town's entrance, and there, there were continuous silent flashes of light... [[4278 旁白 neutral]]
    Dazzling and colorful lights seemed like a divine miracle descending, but the town remained quiet. Looking from afar, it was as if a strange pantomime was being performed in this remote corner. [[4279 旁白 neutral]]
    Sena swallowed her words. She didn't need Matthew to remind her. Ever since the nuns voluntarily started patrolling the town, an unusual scene had already entered their eyes, but they could only remain silent. [[4280 旁白 neutral]]
    As nuns who couldn't even tie a chicken, the only thing they could do at this moment was to pray devoutly to God, hoping that God would hear their prayers and send blessings to Father, who was on an unnamed battlefield, and to Sister Isabella, who had disappeared. [[4281 旁白 neutral]]
    They firmly believed that these two most virtuous individuals were certainly working hard for the safety of the town. For this, as fellow clergy of the church, they had to maintain the normal operation of the town and prevent internal strife in the town that the two had sworn to protect. [[4282 旁白 neutral]]
    "Mr. Matthew, there are some things we can't say easily, but since you've seen it, please don't spread the word, after all..." [[4283 塞纳 neutral]]
    "I understand, of course I understand." [[4284 马修 neutral]]
    Matthew showed a look of understanding, but looking towards the direction where the light was flashing, his expression couldn't help but deepen. [[4285 旁白 neutral]]
    Building high walls for many people, attempting to block all hardships with one's own flesh and blood—he was no stranger to such a choice. After all, every Water Saintess was almost like this, but... [[4286 旁白 neutral]]
    With such a lonely sacrifice, would she still choose to be that destined still pool of dead water? [[4287 旁白 sad]]
