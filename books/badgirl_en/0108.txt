Chapter 108: The Vessel [[6376 旁白 neutral]]
It's crazy, everything is crazy... [[6377 旁白 fearful]]
When the vast water light covered the night sky and replaced the heavens, Cayetana, looking up, felt herself plunged into an unreal madness. Either she was crazy, or the world was crazy! [[6378 旁白 fearful]]
Anyway, between the two, one must be abnormal. So, was she too old to keep up with the times, or had this world developed to a point she no longer understood after thousands of years? [[6379 旁白 neutral]]
A fifth-tier Stigmata Sorcerer instantly cast a forbidden spell. Why would she have such an absurd dream? [[6380 旁白 surprised]]
As everyone knows, Sages are called Sages because they have touched the highest mystery in the field of magic—the ultimate point called the forbidden spell. [[6381 旁白 neutral]]
From a certain perspective, forbidden spells are no longer truly magic. Magic is essentially a mage resonating with the corresponding elemental laws through chanting and the connection with magic power. A forbidden spell, however, directly integrates a part of the laws they master into this pre-compiled destruction project... [[6382 旁白 neutral]]
To put it simply, magic is more like humans in their previous life understanding and knowing the law, then taking up legal weapons within appropriate boundaries to defend themselves or judge enemies. Forbidden spells are simpler and cruder. Those who master this ability have left the plaintiff and defendant seats and directly sat on the judge's bench. [[6383 旁白 neutral]]
This is an essential difference! [[6384 旁白 neutral]]
Just like the outcome between the defendant and the plaintiff depends on both sides' understanding of the law and application of the rules, but if you provoke the judge, then His Honor can take the law itself and hit your head hard. [[6385 旁白 neutral]]
One borrows power, the other uses it directly. Can the power and effect be the same? [[6386 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, Transcendent Magic is the pinnacle of the magic series. Categorizing forbidden spells as magic is completely beyond the scope, and normal Sages can only master Transcendent Magic. [[6387 旁白 neutral]]
Sages are powerful precisely because they can cast Transcendent Magic alone. For example, the White Sage in the White Tower, a famous human organization, used [Transcendent Magic: Ice System: Ice Bloom Skyfall], which once achieved the proud record of one person and one Transcendent Magic destroying an entire small city. [[6388 旁白 neutral]]
But forbidden spells are different. Their existence is more like the meaning contained in the first character of their name: forbidden spells themselves are a "taboo." Once used, the consequences are unimaginable. [[6389 旁白 fearful]]
And the so-called forbidden spells touched by Sages mentioned before only mean that Sages are qualified to touch the threshold of forbidden spells. Young Sages often feel dizzy and dazed after studying magic patterns related to forbidden spells for a long time. Only a small group of old folks at the peak of the fifth tier actually use them, and even then, there are significant prerequisites. [[6390 旁白 neutral]]
In Cayetana's long life, she had personally witnessed the entire process of a fifth-tier Stigmata Sorcerer activating a forbidden spell. That Sage, standing in the center of the city's tall towers, guided almost all the city's mages to chant in unison. In the city, hundreds of mages and various pre-prepared conditions helped. [[6391 旁白 neutral]]
During this process, if there was even a tiny mistake, everyone in the city would be buried with the unformed and out-of-control forbidden spell. [[6392 旁白 fearful]]
In fact, everything has long been written in the name of the rank. Sage is just the current human honorific and title for fifth-tier powerhouses. The true name of a fifth-tier mage is Stigmata Sorcerer, and its next tier, called "Ancient Language Sage" by the Elves, is the true origin of the title "Sage." [[6393 旁白 neutral]]
And only upon reaching the sixth tier, becoming an "Ancient Language Sage," can one truly be said to have mastered the key to unlocking forbidden spells. [[6394 旁白 neutral]]
But even a sixth-tier wouldn't cast a forbidden spell this quickly, right? [[6395 旁白 surprised]]
Cayetana herself is a sixth-tier Vampire. Vampires are considered one of the races most skilled in magic among demons. Frankly speaking, it would be absolutely impossible for her to silently conjure such a forbidden spell alone during the gaps in their recent battle. So... [[6396 旁白 neutral]]
How did this fifth-tier Water Saintess do it? [[6397 旁白 surprised]]
Facing the unstoppable forbidden spell's might, Cayetana, who had lived for countless years, suddenly thought of a possibility. As one of the few remaining Vampires personally embraced by the First Progenitor, her age was far greater than many guessed. [[6398 旁白 neutral]]
Blessed with endless life, she had also fortunately witnessed the tail end of that golden age—a special era where gods walked the earth, and myths coexisted with history. [[6399 旁白 neutral]]
She had personally witnessed a god. Though not a formal audience, the various incredible phenomena displayed by the girl made her think of a possibility—a Descending Vessel. [[6400 旁白 surprised]]
Only this could explain the various "unreasonable" phenomena on the girl. If her guess was correct... [[6401 旁白 neutral]]
Cayetana's delicate body trembled as she faced the Water Forbidden Spell alone. The trembling was not from fear, but from excitement. [[6402 旁白 happy]]
If it were truly so, then her chance had come. Even if it was only a possibility right now, but this isn't a small possibility and is still enough for her to stake her life. [[6403 旁白 neutral]]
After all, that was a god, one of the seven true Creator Gods on the entire Nephelem Continent truly recognized by the World Will! [[6404 旁白 neutral]]
More importantly, she had encountered the God of Water. If it were the other six true gods, Cayetana wouldn't even hope for such a possibility. But if it was the benevolent Mother Goddess of Life... [[6405 旁白 neutral]]
All in! [[6406 旁白 neutral]]
An incomparable fanaticism and madness surged in Cayetana's eyes. In just a few seconds of thought, she had made the decision to stake everything. What about endless life? What about eternal youth? [[6407 旁白 angry]]
These things that mortals dream of craving were, in Cayetana's eyes, merely a curse they could never escape in their entire lives. If she could witness that god with her own eyes, everything would be worth abandoning! [[6408 旁白 happy]]
And so, this scene happened... [[6409 旁白 neutral]]
"The battle has begun!" [[6410 旁白 neutral]]
"May this blood allow me to behold the divine!" [[6411 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
The cherry-colored Vampire Grand Duke proclaimed, looking up at the sky. [[6412 旁白 neutral]]
After speaking, her body went limp as if drained of strength, and she knelt on the ground. Her cherry-colored long hair fell limply. Then, blood began to flow from her seven orifices, endlessly... [[6413 旁白 neutral]]
Billions of blood beads rose against gravity into an inverted crimson sky-waterfall. The surging blood tide on the ground transformed into screaming skeletal giant hands grasping at the sky, and fiercely collided with the world-destroying deluge that carried the mermaid princess's lamenting tears! [[6414 旁白 neutral]]
Above the firmament, was the world-destroying deluge and lament; below the earth, was the frantic blood sea and raging waves. [[6415 旁白 neutral]]
The moment the blood waves touched the azure flood peak, all crimson skeletons instantly crystallized, then disintegrated into countless red crystal fragments within the divine torrent. The space at the junction of the two forbidden-spell-level powers began to twist and collapse, and the overflowing energy tore the clouds into spiraling blood-blue vortices. [[6416 旁白 neutral]]
The raging torrent of blood and blue spread out, tearing at the sky. [[6417 旁白 neutral]]
