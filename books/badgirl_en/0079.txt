Chapter 79 Timely Wind (Three Views) [[4476 旁白 neutral]]
    The last surviving vampire was right before him. Andre stepped over countless corpses and came before this monster, who was hanging upside down. [[4477 旁白 neutral]]
    The vampire, tied up with wind ropes, was completely terrified, like a bird startled by a bow. His pale, delicate face showed only endless fear and signs of impending breakdown. [[4478 旁白 fearful]]
    Andre's blood-stained face showed no joy or sorrow. He raised his gun-sword and placed its blade on the neck of the frightened kid. [[4479 旁白 neutral]]
    The sharpness and coldness of the blade made the vampire abandon all dignity. He burst into tears, and his splendid clothes were soaked with a foul-smelling liquid. [[4480 旁白 fearful]]
    "So you know fear too?" [[4481 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre looked at the vampire who had peed himself and grinned, but there was no warmth in his smile. [[4482 旁白 neutral]]
    "No, don't kill me... My... great father, will, will..." [[4483 陌生男1 fearful]]
    "To live, you're even calling out to your father?" [[4484 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella, who had just arrived, happened to overhear this conversation and couldn't help but laugh. [[4485 旁白 happy]]
    "No, please save me, I, I don't want, don't want..." [[4486 陌生男1 fearful]]
    The upside-down vampire cried tears and snot, his face twisted with fear and panic. [[4487 旁白 fearful]]
    Isabella wanted to step forward and taunt him some more, but Andre suddenly reached out and stopped her. The grey-haired nun was puzzled, only hearing the man's extremely tense warning. [[4488 旁白 fearful]]
    "Something's wrong! His body... step back quickly!" [[4489 安德烈 fearful]]
    Before his words fully fell, the vampire's painful wails already echoed in the air. [[4490 旁白 fearful]]
    "Ugh ahhhhh! Spare me... ahh, please forgive my father, ahhhhhhh...!!!" [[4491 陌生男1 fearful]]
    Along with the wails, there was a crackling muffled sound from inside the vampire's body. His body began to swell abnormally from the inside out, and dark lines appeared on his pale skin. The lines crisscrossed at the bottom of his skin, forming an ominous evil totem. [[4492 旁白 fearful]]
    Isabella's pupils suddenly constricted. Her ability as a Fourth-Rank Archmage allowed her to more keenly sense how ominous the power gradually erupting within the vampire was. A second before Andre's warning, she had already tightly grabbed the man's back collar. The wings of wind behind her instantly unfurled, and she flapped them vigorously, pulling Andre into the air. [[4493 旁白 fearful]]
    The strong wind whistled past his ears. Andre's eyes were fixed on the ground, which was getting further and further away, and the abnormally swollen fleshy tumor, almost completely losing its human form, hanging from the wind ropes. [[4494 旁白 fearful]]
    What in the world is this thing? [[4495 安德烈 surprised]]
    Even as an old player of this game, Andre had never seen a vampire in this form. Ghouls were already the ugliest form of this race, but now, it's hard to say... [[4496 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella, still pulling Andre, was rapidly moving further away. But the faster they flew and the higher they ascended, the houses on the edge of Kempfer Town came into view. [[4497 旁白 neutral]]
    "No, that fleshy tumor is still expanding, we can't leave, otherwise the town's safety won't be guaranteed!" [[4498 安德烈 fearful]]
    Andre immediately grew anxious, his voice carrying a rare hint of impatience. [[4499 旁白 fearful]]
    "Damn it! Why do these modules keep coming up with disgusting techniques every day?!" [[4500 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
    Clearly, Isabella also realized this. She stopped flying, hovering in mid-air, and looked back at the previous battlefield. The fleshy tumor on the blood-soaked, mountainous battlefield was indeed still continuously expanding. [[4501 旁白 neutral]]
    Just now, it had only expanded to the height of an adult, but now it vaguely showed signs of expanding into a mountain of flesh. If this continued, the nearby Kempfer would definitely be affected, and it was completely too late to evacuate the residents now! [[4502 旁白 fearful]]
    But if they used large-scale magic or domain skills, the uncontrollable immense power of magic might also endanger the town. [[4503 旁白 neutral]]
    Watching the fleshy tumor grow larger and larger, and with Isabella unable to think of a solution for a while, Andre's heart sank. He reached for the back of his hand; the snowflake mark there had already faded, so he could only rely on... [[4504 旁白 sad]]
    The man had already prepared for the worst. A clear azure blue was vaguely emerging in his emerald eyes. A strange fluctuation erupted out of nowhere from his magic-dry body, and his silver hair began to develop into the color of the ocean... [[4505 旁白 neutral]]
    Noticing Andre's abnormality, whom she was pulling by the collar, Isabella frowned. [[4506 旁白 surprised]]
    "This magic fluctuation... What are you doing?" [[4507 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
    "Isabella, send me over, as close to the fleshy tumor as possible." [[4508 安德烈 neutral]]
    "It's very dangerous there, you are now..." [[4509 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
    "No time to explain, just listen to me first! I have a way to solve it!" [[4510 安德烈 neutral]]
    Isabella's body stiffened. She had never heard Andre speak to her with such a decisive tone, but because of this, she also knew she couldn't dissuade the man. [[4511 旁白 neutral]]
    "Okay, I'll send you over. As for the town, I'll protect everyone." [[4512 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Thank you." [[4513 安德烈 neutral]]
    The distant blue light beam in the sky returned. Andre, hanging in mid-air, had made all preparations. He was getting closer and closer to the terrifyingly expanding fleshy tumor on the ground, his dormant divine blood ready to burst forth. [[4514 旁白 neutral]]
    As soon as Isabella let go, he would complete his transformation during the fall, and then activate [Covenant of Non-Combat] the moment he hit the ground. Although he wasn't entirely sure if the uncontrolled expansion of this fleshy tumor fell within the [Covenant of Non-Combat]'s restrictions, at this point, he could only take a gamble! [[4515 旁白 neutral]]
    Anyway, his life was tough, he wasn't afraid to gamble! [[4516 旁白 neutral]]
    "Now!" [[4517 安德烈 neutral]]
    As Isabella let go, Andre's body plummeted. Violent winds poured into his ears and nose, and his lips could barely close under the immense wind pressure. A sapphire blue light enveloped his form. From a distance, he looked like a giant water droplet about to crash into a mountain of flesh. [[4518 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella, flying rapidly towards the town, looked back at this scene, her heart in her throat. Although she didn't know what power Andre was using, could he really survive crashing directly into that disgusting fleshy tumor with his bare body? [[4519 旁白 fearful]]
    At this critical moment, the wind was mobilized. [[4520 旁白 neutral]]
    Upon feeling this familiar abnormality, Isabella's eyes lit up. She voluntarily dismissed the wings of wind behind her and landed steadily on the ground, trying not to control any more wind elements in the air. [[4521 旁白 neutral]]
    The ability to instantly mobilize all wind elements in an area was something only the current Wind Saintess possessed. [[4522 旁白 neutral]]
    Miss is here! [[4523 旁白 happy]]
    In an instant, a blue light arrow streaked across the sky, illuminating the entire night. The flowing light passed in a flash, disappearing into the darkness. After a brief two seconds of silence, a blue energy wind storm erupted. The expanding black fleshy tumor vanished in an instant, cut into nothingness by a thousand winds. [[4524 旁白 neutral]]
    At the same time, the sapphire blue water droplet that Andre had transformed into, which was about to collide with the mountain of flesh, was lifted by a gust of wind that rose out of nowhere. The wind dispersed the blue magic power gathered around him, and a figure landed simultaneously. [[4525 旁白 neutral]]
