Chapter 37: Reset 37 - Endless Life [[2119 旁白 neutral]]
Water, which nurtures all things. Water, which embraces all life. [[2120 旁白 neutral]]
The saintess, a symbol of peace, sang a hymn of peace. Her head touched the sky and her feet stood on the ground. She summoned the spring waters to melt the pale ice disaster and a warm, gentle wind to drive away the land's bitter cold. [[2121 旁白 neutral]]
The winter snow melted into spring water, nourishing the barren land. As seeds of life were planted anew in the moist soil, seeds of hope were once again planted in the wasteland named Craigmore. [[2122 旁白 happy]]
Life, as far as the eye could see. Tender new lives sprouted from the ground like bamboo shoots after rain, replacing the wasteland's dull gray with a vibrant, growing green. [[2123 旁白 happy]]
The spring of life created a vast oasis in an instant. Plants and animals, in their own unique ways, showed the greatness and vibrancy of life to all who watched. [[2124 旁白 happy]]
The demon soldiers stared with wide eyes, looking around in disbelief. They witnessed the whole process of life appearing from nothing, until tender green leaves sprouted before their eyes and bright flowers bloomed at their feet. [[2125 旁白 surprised]]
Having spent all their time in the harsh, decaying lands of the Demon Realm, most demons had never seen such a magical sight of nature. Even when they left their realm, it was usually to charge into battle under the command of a general, endlessly fighting other races. [[2126 旁白 neutral]]
Their eyes were not only filled with the red of blood and the gray of death. As demons, they simply never had the chance to touch and feel the beauty of the world. [[2127 旁白 sad]]
At this moment, the demon soldiers' awe and wonder at life overcame their instinctive thirst for blood and slaughter. The gray wasteland had been turned into a fertile plain by the saintess's song, and the singing girl reflected in their eyes became the center of the world. [[2128 旁白 surprised]]
With a series of clattering sounds, the stunned demon soldiers, one by one, intentionally or not, loosened their grip on their weapons, letting the bloodstained tools of slaughter fall to the ground. [[2129 旁白 neutral]]
An entire demon battalion lost all its will to fight in less time than a single song. [[2130 旁白 surprised]]
This wasn't achieved by scaring them with greater force, but by the song. It was the blue-haired saintess, with the blood of a benevolent god in her veins, who used her voice to end this war. [[2131 旁白 neutral]]
The killing did not just stop; it ended abruptly because of her arrival. [[2132 旁白 surprised]]
No one knew why a war started by racial conflict and self-interest would stop for no reason, just because of one person's power. [[2133 旁白 surprised]]
At the center of the battlefield, the blue-haired Lobelia was completely lost in her song. Since her bloodline had awakened and divine blood had bathed her body, many memories that shouldn't have existed appeared in his mind. [[2134 旁白 neutral]]
But those memories blended perfectly with his soul, without any sense of conflict, as if these newfound things had always belonged to her. They were carved into his very bones and blood, impossible to forget. [[2135 旁白 neutral]]
The hymn named "Peace" was just a small, ordinary part of these vast memories. [[2136 旁白 neutral]]
While singing, she felt almost completely cut off from the outside world, as if she were drifting among the stars, having become one of them. [[2137 旁白 neutral]]
Lying in her arms, Serenia also seemed affected by the song. Color slowly returned to her pale lips and cheeks, her weak breathing grew steady, and her eyelashes trembled faintly, as if she were about to awaken. [[2138 旁白 happy]]
The Water Saintess was focused on her song, and the Ice Saintess had not yet recovered. [[2139 旁白 neutral]]
Kegesa would not miss such a perfect opportunity. Although the Saintess had immense divine power, she wasn't tough like a demon. To be blunt, she was a glass cannon—high damage, but very fragile. [[2140 旁白 neutral]]
With both of them right in front of him, he didn't even need to get close. He just had to lift his great bone axe, and with one swing, he could take out the two greatest warriors of the human faction. [[2141 旁白 neutral]]
The idea was great, but reality was harsh. Even with the hymn's influence, most demons had lost their will to fight. But as a high demon, the killing intent in Kegesa's eyes was almost visible. He wanted nothing more than to crush the two weak girls into pulp, but he couldn't do it, because... [[2142 旁白 angry]]
His body disobeyed his mind's command. Whenever he tried to harm the blue-haired girl, his body felt like a rusted suit of iron armor. His joints wouldn't move correctly. Controlling his own body became the hardest thing in the world. The distance of less than ten meters seemed farther than the entire vast Demon Realm. [[2143 旁白 fearful]]
He couldn't even walk up to them, let alone kill them. [[2144 旁白 fearful]]
He turned to order the unfrozen soldiers behind him to kill the saintesses. But when he looked, he saw a large number of demon soldiers had dropped their weapons. The clattering sound of the weapons hitting the ground was like heavy hammers striking his soul. [[2145 旁白 surprised]]
That's right... if even he couldn't kill the Water Saintess, what chance did the ordinary demon soldiers behind him have? [[2146 旁白 sad]]
After hearing this hymn, they had probably lost even their most basic will to fight. [[2147 旁白 sad]]
At this moment, a strange feeling of helplessness washed over him. The great demon, who had always been victorious on the battlefield, could do nothing to the human saintess who was right in front of him. [[2148 旁白 fearful]]
Raindrops of light drifted down onto the lively field. Behind Lobelia, a massive amount of life force gathered. Nurtured by this immense power, a green sprout grew rapidly, and a towering ancient tree rose from the ground, sending out a powerful wave of life that drove away the last traces of death from the land. [[2149 旁白 happy]]
But the snow that brought the silence had not completely disappeared. Under the branches and shade of the ancient tree, some pure white snow still covered the ground near its roots. [[2150 旁白 neutral]]
The warmth of spring and the quiet of winter miraculously merged, creating a wondrous sight that few people would ever see in their lifetime. [[2151 旁白 neutral]]
The song was now coming to an end. At the last note, Lobelia opened her gently closed eyes. Her watery blue eyes shone with a mother's tenderness and affection. [[2152 旁白 happy]]
With the final verses of the hymn, she sang as if calling out. [[2153 旁白 neutral]]
"No more fear of right or wrong embraced under my shield." [[2154 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Call out my name when you see the tide turn me away." [[2156 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"It's time to wake up from your dream, my little crybaby~" [[2158 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
