Chapter 27: Reset 27 Pure Combat [[1568 旁白 neutral]]
In the dying blizzard, two fires of sinful desire burned fiercely in the white snow. [[1569 旁白 neutral]]
Then they rushed at each other, leaving only afterimages. The intensity of the fight scattered the snow on the ground. The rapidly rising heat from their bodies melted the snow and evaporated the moisture, creating a cloud of steam in the extremely cold environment. [[1570 旁白 neutral]]
This was a true battle between demons. There was no hint of thought, only pure killing intent. Every move was aimed at killing the other, a duel fought purely on the body's beastly instincts! [[1571 旁白 neutral]]
The fight was dazzling, not because it was filled with magic and light effects. On the contrary, both sides used their magic in a primitive way. Two forces of desire-filled magic clashed, strengthening their own bodies. [[1572 旁白 neutral]]
The clash of succubus claws sparked. They seemed evenly matched, but Mara was older and had a clear advantage in combat experience over the newborn succubus. She forcefully parried "Selen An's" attack, and during that brief moment of stiffness, she quickly followed up. Her right hand swung at the succubus's relatively fragile neck, creating a sharp sound that tore through the air. [[1573 旁白 neutral]]
Facing a strike so fast it was just an afterimage, the human Selen An would never have been able to dodge. Even if his eyes caught the trajectory of the attack, his stiff body could not have reacted in time. To attack and dodge like Mara required long-term training to activate the body and even develop muscle memory. [[1574 旁白 neutral]]
But with no combat experience, she dodged it with a risky backbend. While the demon body's enhancement was a factor, this dodge was driven more by instinct. [[1575 旁白 neutral]]
Combat is a demon's instinct, even for a succubus, who is not skilled in fighting among demons. Killing and dodging are etched into their very genes. [[1576 旁白 neutral]]
"Die! Die! Die!" [[1577 玛拉 angry]]
In the blur of afterimages, Mara's eyes were red with killing intent. At this moment, she had lost all desire to toy with her prey. Her attacks were vicious, cunning, and venomous, aimed only at quickly taking her opponent's life. [[1578 旁白 angry]]
The longer it dragged on, the more shocked and angry she became. It was just a newborn succubus, even if it was a high-ranking one, it was still just a sprout that hadn't grown. Even a powerful dragon whelp could still be easily hunted by an experienced knight. [[1579 旁白 angry]]
That was the theory. But why, in her case, was she sweating more and more as the fight went on? [[1580 旁白 surprised]]
Perhaps the human body had sealed his bloodline and talents. Once corrupted, although the bloodline was tainted, it also, in a way, unleashed the power locked within the divine blood. An adult succubus fighting a newborn succubus to a sweat? What a joke! [[1581 旁白 angry]]
Shifting the perspective to Selen An, her side wasn't easy either. Although the succubus body had boosted her combat power for a short time, she had been a succubus for too little time. So little time that she didn't have a chance to get used to this body before being forced into battle. [[1582 旁白 fearful]]
Facing Mara's almost crazed assault, she could only manage to defend herself through instinct. Although they both managed to injure each other, the wounds on her own body were clearly more numerous. Even though her healing was faster than Mara's, the constant self-healing was making her body feel tired and sore... [[1583 旁白 fearful]]
Her stamina was draining like an open floodgate. A high-ranking succubus certainly had a higher potential than Mara, but having just become one, how could she reach that limit? Mara was clearly superior in terms of endurance. This could be seen from the frequency of their attacks. Her own claw strikes were getting slower, gradually unable to keep up with Mara's speed. While Mara was also tiring, her condition was visibly better. [[1584 旁白 fearful]]
Demons are extremely sensitive to the details of a fight. Mara noticed that Selen An's attacks were losing their rhythm and immediately pressed her advantage. More and more of her attacks landed, and the dense wounds came too fast to heal. This new body was about to be overwhelmed... [[1585 旁白 fearful]]
Finally, Mara caught a major opening in Selen An's defense. Instantly, all her magic power gathered in her right hand. The fleshy wings on her back trembled, and the powerful thrust propelled the succubus's light body forward in a nearly unavoidable rush. Her right hand, with fingers held together like a spear and enhanced by magic, pierced through Selen An's undefended abdomen. [[1586 旁白 surprised]]
Her arm went straight through from front to back. The blood splattered on Mara's face, making the fanatical excitement in her eyes look even more demonic. [[1587 旁白 happy]]
She met the other's wide, rapidly fading pink, heart-shaped pupils. Her long tongue licked the blood from her face with great pleasure. [[1588 旁白 happy]]
"It seems I've won, Master." [[1589 玛拉 happy]]
"You..." [[1590 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An seemed to want to speak, but the blood rising in her throat only allowed her to utter a hoarse "You." [[1591 旁白 fearful]]
"Even with your abdomen pierced, a succubus doesn't die so easily. But even if you don't die, Master, you must pay the price for your foolish actions." [[1592 玛拉 angry]]
As she spoke, Mara's eyes were filled with cruelty and bloodlust. [[1593 旁白 angry]]
"This noble demon bloodline is truly wasted on you. Since this was a battle for our fates, the loser should give up everything. Now, I will devour your bloodline!" [[1594 玛拉 angry]]
Mara's body was trembling, not from fear, but from excitement. [[1595 旁白 happy]]
Selen An's accidental transformation into a high-ranking succubus was both an accident and an opportunity. Bloodlines were extremely important among demons. A demon transformed from a human usually had a very low status, just a slave to be ordered around, as General Kexar saw them. [[1596 旁白 neutral]]
But it would be different once she devoured Selen An's bloodline. Besides inheriting bloodlines like humans, demons also had the bloody method of devouring. A low-ranking demon could evolve into a high-ranking demon by devouring the bloodline of a high-ranking one. [[1597 旁白 neutral]]
However, in the normal demon world, this was almost impossible. Not to mention that it was nearly impossible for a low-ranking demon to defeat a high-ranking one. In a battle with the goal of seizing the opponent's bloodline, defeat meant death. Even a newborn high-ranking demon would be protected by other high-ranking demons, who would never allow a malicious demon a chance to strike. [[1598 旁白 neutral]]
But right here, right now, was such an opportunity: a newborn, still weak, high-ranking succubus. [[1599 旁白 happy]]
Currently, she was the only one who knew that Selen An had become a high-ranking succubus. If she devoured her bloodline, no one would stop her. General Kogsath only wanted Selen An alive after her corruption anyway. [[1600 旁白 neutral]]
Due to the strong life force of demons, Selen An wouldn't die even if her bloodline was devoured. She would become a useless demon without a bloodline, with no chance of ever rising again. Her status in the demon world would be so low that she might even be classified among the lowest and filthiest ranks, like ghouls. [[1601 旁白 neutral]]
Even if General Kogsath investigated later, so what? [[1602 旁白 neutral]]
In the demon world, strength was what mattered. Once she devoured the bloodline and became a high-ranking succubus, she would escape her previously humble status. Combined with the credit for capturing Selen An, she might even rise to a position equal to General Kogsath! [[1603 旁白 happy]]
At this thought, her gaze on Selen An grew even more feverish. [[1604 旁白 happy]]
"Don't worry, your bloodline will be well nurtured within my body, and I will take your place as a new great demon in the demon world!" [[1605 玛拉 happy]]
The heavily injured Selen An lifted her head. There was no despair in her pink, heart-shaped pupils. Under Mara's confused gaze, she suddenly shot out her left hand and placed it on the other's shoulder, her five fingers gripping like iron pincers. [[1606 旁白 surprised]]
"This way... you can't escape, can you?" [[1607 塞伦安 happy]]
Her voice was weak, but it carried a thick, noticeable smile. [[1608 旁白 happy]]
"What are you talking about... Agh?!" [[1609 玛拉 surprised]]
A vaguely familiar feeling, the dull sound of a sharp object piercing flesh. [[1610 旁白 surprised]]
"Tsssss..." [[1611 旁白 neutral]]
White smoke was accompanied by a piercing sizzle. Besides the smell of blood, the air now carried the scent of burnt flesh. [[1612 旁白 neutral]]
She looked down and saw that the beautiful, unsharpened holy sword, which looked like a work of art, was halfway buried in her abdomen. The hand gripping the hilt, still sizzling with white smoke, belonged to Selen An, who had become a succubus. [[1613 旁白 surprised]]
PS: Happy May Day, everyone! [[1614 旁白 neutral]]
