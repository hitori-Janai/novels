Chapter 87: My People [[4924 旁白 neutral]]
"It's just a pity we came too late." [[4925 墨莺 sad]]
Mo Ying said calmly. [[4926 旁白 neutral]]
"Indeed, that guy Andre really keeps a low profile. I didn't expect him to be the Ice Saintess's Chief Paladin, even though outside rumors said the Ice Saintess hadn't appointed a chief yet." [[4927 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella sighed, feeling a bit regretful. [[4928 旁白 sad]]
"If he were just an ordinary subordinate, surely, if the young lady asked the Ice Saintess for him, that Highness would not refuse." [[4929 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Although the relationship between Saintesses wasn't as close as one might imagine, they were all descendants of true gods. Plus, with the massive divine organization of the Church existing, they were all under the same roof, so to speak. As long as the request wasn't excessive, most would give face. [[4930 旁白 neutral]]
But it just so happened that the person they were interested in was the Ice Saintess's Chief Paladin. Outside rumors said the Ice Maiden had not appointed a chief, and the Ice Saintess herself never denied this rumor, which was like tacitly confirming this guess in a way. [[4931 旁白 neutral]]
Now, after learning the truth, the conflict between reality and rumor made the master and servant think more deeply. [[4932 旁白 neutral]]
"Father Andre is indeed a wonderful person, but regarding recruiting him, let's not think about it anymore." [[4933 墨莺 neutral]]
"Although I haven't interacted much with that Ice Saintess, only observing her succession, just a few simple interactions and conversations made me realize that this descendant of the God of Judgment is definitely not a sister to be easily provoked." [[4934 墨莺 neutral]]
Mo Ying recalled past experiences. Looking from afar, the cold and noble girl slightly lowered her head during the Pope's personal coronation. Even when bowing, she could still feel a dazzling sharpness from her eyes, half-hidden by silver threads. [[4935 旁白 neutral]]
Her gaze was like a sword, cutting through everything in an instant! [[4936 旁白 neutral]]
"If I were to infer from her personality, I could probably guess Serenia's thoughts. For such a strong person to even lie to hide her appointed Chief, doesn't that look like a unique form of protection from a certain perspective?" [[4937 墨莺 neutral]]
Actually, Mo Ying wanted to use the more vivid term "hoarding food," but due to the Saintess's image and modesty, she chose to express it more politely. [[4938 旁白 neutral]]
In any case, every Chief Paladin is the most trustworthy person to a Saintess, besides herself. Sometimes, this trust can even surpass that of relatives connected by blood. [[4939 旁白 neutral]]
"And besides that, Mr. Andre still has quite a few secrets~" [[4940 墨莺 surprised]]
Isabella paused, her delicate brows slightly furrowed. [[4941 旁白 surprised]]
She had been with Andre for two years and only recently learned of his identity as Chief Paladin. Her young lady had just arrived, and besides this secret, had she uncovered even more shocking things? [[4942 旁白 surprised]]
Andre, this guy, really... he hides things so well usually. Now, Isabella just wants to say: [[4943 旁白 neutral]]
There are masters among us. [[4944 旁白 neutral]]
"Young lady, Andre, he..." [[4945 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"You might not have noticed, but the day before yesterday, the moment I arrived at the battlefield, weren't you carrying Andre, helping him launch a falling attack from above?" [[4946 墨莺 neutral]]
Mo Ying's question made Isabella recall the scene that day. The situation was urgent then, and she didn't pay much attention to details, but she clearly remembered dragging Andre by his collar and throwing him towards the meat mountain. [[4947 旁白 neutral]]
"Indeed, I originally disagreed, but he strongly insisted he had a way. At that time, the expansion of the flesh body couldn't be stopped, so we had no choice but to..." [[4948 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"So, did you notice anything different about his body when it fell towards the meat mountain?" [[4949 墨莺 neutral]]
Mo Ying reminded her again. Isabella frowned deeply and even stopped walking. [[4950 旁白 surprised]]
"Could it be the magic fluctuations around him?" [[4951 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"That's it." [[4952 墨莺 neutral]]
"I know I mentioned Andre to you; he's not good at magic. But if he has the identity of the Ice Saintess's Chief Paladin, he must also have the blessings personally bestowed by the Saintess. With the Saintess's blessings, even a farmer could easily summon ice elements. Is there... anything wrong with that?" [[4953 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Was it truly just ice elements?" [[4954 墨莺 neutral]]
Mo Ying put her hands behind her back, turned around, and faced Isabella, her eyes holding a meaningful smile. [[4955 旁白 neutral]]
"I... wait! Your Highness, do you mean?!" [[4956 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella had heard several shocking secrets today. She originally thought the rest would be ordinary reports about her tasks, but she didn't expect to step on a landmine today. This topic was truly one explosive revelation after another! [[4957 旁白 surprised]]
After Mo Ying's continuous questions and reminders, Isabella desperately recalled the scene that day, analyzed its details, and finally discovered something she had overlooked at the time, which now seemed extremely wrong. [[4958 旁白 neutral]]
"The magic he showed back then wasn't ice elements; it was a milder kind than ice..." [[4959 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"It was the purest water elements~" [[4960 墨莺 happy]]
Mo Ying gently revealed the answer. [[4961 旁白 neutral]]
"I really didn't expect..." [[4962 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella was temporarily speechless, shocked by this truth. [[4963 旁白 surprised]]
"It's understandable that you were deceived. After all, not only do water and ice elements display similar magic colors, but their essences are also very close. Ice turns into water, and water solidifies into ice. This subtle change, if not specifically paid attention to, could deceive even a Grand Magister like you for a moment." [[4964 墨莺 neutral]]
There was a smile in the girl's emerald eyes, and her steps became a little lighter, as if she felt a small sense of pride in her cleverness. [[4965 旁白 happy]]
"But if it's just a difference in elements, the problem shouldn't be that big, right? This only shows that Andre has a certain affinity for water elements. Using water elements to cover his entire body isn't very difficult..." [[4966 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Isabella, you're not carefully reading the question again~ I said the purest water elements, not ordinary water elements." [[4967 墨莺 neutral]]
The girl pouted in dissatisfaction, and Isabella's golden-brown pupils sharply constricted. [[4968 旁白 surprised]]
"This, this..." [[4969 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"Surprised, aren't you? Your colleague, whom you've been with for two years, is not only the Ice Saintess's hidden Chief Paladin, but he also possesses the bloodline of the Winglet family, oh dear~" [[4970 墨莺 happy]]
"Isabella, the talent you found for me really has a complicated background~" [[4971 墨莺 neutral]]
"Then, Your Highness, regarding Andre, are you planning to..." [[4972 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
At this moment, Isabella had regained her composure. She didn't even notice that when she spoke, her voice unconsciously carried a hint of worry. [[4973 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, don't use that tone. You're making it sound like your young lady, me, is a cruel Saintess. You should know my personality. With such complicated relationships, I don't want to get involved in this messy situation, especially since it concerns two other Saintesses." [[4974 墨莺 neutral]]
The girl propped her chin with one hand, looking rather helpless. [[4975 旁白 neutral]]
"As a junior who just recently succeeded, it's better for me to avoid these seniors." [[4976 墨莺 neutral]]
"Besides, no matter how good Andre is, it doesn't change the fact that he's a man. I can't easily arrange a position for him because of that." [[4977 墨莺 neutral]]
"So?" [[4978 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Aren't there two candidates? In your letter, you mentioned not only Andre but also the nun named Evelyn. I think you praised her like a goddess; the level of intimacy in your words even surpassed your respect for me~" [[4979 墨莺 neutral]]
"No, Your Highness, I just..." [[4980 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella quickly waved her hand, wanting to explain. [[4981 旁白 neutral]]
"It's alright, I won't be jealous. After all, the reason I came here was to bring such a lovely and perfect girl into my exclusive harem. From now on, she and you will be like sisters, and both of you will be my people..." [[4982 墨莺 happy]]
"Although I can be a bit petty, no matter how narrow-minded I am, I would never be jealous of my own girls, right? Isabella~" [[4983 墨莺 happy]]
"Your, Your Highness..." [[4984 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Suddenly, affectionate and suggestive words entered Isabella's ears, causing a flush to appear on the cheeks of the normally relaxed and mature-looking Arch-nun. [[4985 旁白 surprised]]
