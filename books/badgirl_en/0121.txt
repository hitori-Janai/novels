Chapter 121: Life and Death Struggle [[7139 旁白 neutral]]
    "Why do you think you've already won?" [[7140 旁白 neutral]]
    Watching her domain shrink rapidly, soon not even half of the room, Celestine's expression remained calm. [[7141 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course, for this plan, I prepared for decades. This included infiltrating the Church, capturing your confidants, breaking through her heart, bribing the border guards of the Empire... all of these were gradually advanced without your knowledge." [[7142 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "I poured countless efforts into this, just for this moment. So why do you think you can win against me in this situation?" [[7143 弗拉德 angry]]
    At this point, Vlad was too lazy to continue teasing. He manipulated the blood and shadows of this world, continuously compressing the girl's dwindling domain area, a malicious look in his crimson eyes. [[7144 旁白 neutral]]
    "I know that as the dignified Wind Saintess, you control the great powers of freedom and wisdom, but what does that matter? You have your trump cards, and I have my preparations. As long as you still want to remove your curse, you can't avoid me!" [[7145 弗拉德 neutral]]
    The thick shadows actually corroded the invisible wind, and hundreds of pure white feathers fell from the sky like they were scorched by black flames. [[7146 旁白 fearful]]
    The girl suddenly grunted, half-kneeling on the ground, and dense beads of sweat promptly appeared on her forehead. [[7147 旁白 sad]]
    "Are you beginning to corrupt the authority?" [[7148 塞莱斯特 fearful]]
    She clutched her chest, her voice extremely pained. [[7149 旁白 sad]]
    "Of course, to deal with a Saintess, I must be extremely vigilant. Kogsar, who died at the hands of the Water Saintess before, is a typical example. I will definitely marry you as my wife, but I never underestimate you seemingly weak women." [[7150 弗拉德 neutral]]
    The girl's pale face was almost within reach, and her mental weakness made her already unstable domain flicker like a loose light bulb. [[7151 旁白 neutral]]
    The blue wall between them was so fragile it seemed it would break with a single poke. But just as Vlad opened his mouth, revealing his fangs, the bloodless girl suddenly forced a smile. [[7152 旁白 surprised]]
    "You're right. As long as I hold onto the hope of removing the curse, I can't escape you. But why should I remove the curse?" [[7153 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Vlad was stunned, and an uneasy premonition unconsciously rose in his heart. [[7154 旁白 surprised]]
    "You're at your last gasp, all your trump cards are out. The moment your domain shatters is when you accept your fate. Powerless as you are, at such a close distance, you can't even perform a suicidal all-or-nothing move." [[7155 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Vlad frowned. Although he was a consciousness entity, he felt his heart pounding at that moment, as if foreshadowing something. [[7156 旁白 fearful]]
    "That's not necessarily true. What if there's outside help?" [[7157 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
    ... [[7158 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[7159 旁白 neutral]]
    Medea was horrified. She was surprised by the sudden surge of power from the evenly matched blood kin girl she had just been fighting, who had actually knocked her back. More than surprise, another emotion burst forth in her ruby-like eyes— [[7160 旁白 fearful]]
    Her body flying backward uncontrollably, she looked in terror at the golden-haired blood kin girl, who suddenly summoned a crucifix spear she had never used before. The interval created by the opponent being forcibly knocked back indeed favored pursuit, but the girl's spear tip was not aimed at her, but at the Wind Saintess, who was still tightly bound by her limbs on the cross nearby! [[7161 旁白 fearful]]
    Is she crazy?! [[7162 梅黛亚 angry]]
    Medea couldn't help but roar inwardly. [[7163 旁白 angry]]
    Although she didn't know why a blood kin was wearing a nun's habit, under the current circumstances, neither the identity of a blood kin nor a nun gave her any reason to attack the current Wind Saintess. [[7164 旁白 neutral]]
    What is she doing?! [[7165 梅黛亚 surprised]]
    Vlad, who was still battling Sigrid, naturally had the same thought. To command Avilla to give her orders, he should have been distracted and caught by Sigrid for a throat-slit. Although a throat-slit is a fatal wound for ordinary people, it's not lethal for blood kin. But it was still the throat, one of the body's most vulnerable parts. Even if a high-ranking blood kin had their head cut off, it would take several times longer to reattach it than to recover from an ordinary wound. [[7166 旁白 neutral]]
    After exposing such a large weakness, he thought Avilla, hearing his command, would desperately drag the red-haired witch away from the cross. After all, she was a female slave he had personally embraced and tamed, his most obedient and trusted dog over the years. [[7167 旁白 neutral]]
    But at every crucial moment, the Goddess of Fate seemed to intentionally slap him in the face. [[7168 旁白 angry]]
    Watching the golden-haired blood kin girl lean back, in a posture ready to throw a javelin, Vlad, his face contorted in pain, felt his right eyelid twitch uncontrollably. [[7169 旁白 surprised]]
    Something's not right! [[7170 弗拉德 fearful]]
    "What are you doing?!" [[7171 弗拉德 angry]]
    "Stop! I command you to stop!" [[7172 弗拉德 angry]]
    The man's roar caused faint red ripples in the air. Avilla's body was affected by these red ripples, and her prepared movement suddenly stiffened, her joints and muscles losing control from her brain. [[7173 旁白 fearful]]
    The incident happened so suddenly that both the witch and Vlad had confused expressions. Only Sigrid, as if she didn't care about the Wind Saintess's life or death, once again took advantage of Vlad's distraction. Her rapier swung again, and a sharp sword light pierced through the skin, moving along the gaps between muscles and bones. [[7174 旁白 neutral]]
    With exquisite skill, she performed an almost dismembering operation on Vlad's living body. In an instant, Vlad's key parts and joints were separated from his flesh. [[7175 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ugh! Ahh!" [[7176 弗拉德 sad]]
    Due to the cruel method, this time, even the legendary "Unkillable King" Vlad couldn't help but let out a wail. He abruptly turned his head, his crimson eyes filled with a sinister gaze that seemed to solidify. [[7177 旁白 angry]]
    "I will make you pay the price for insulting a Duke!" [[7178 弗拉德 angry]]
    "Shut up!" [[7179 西格利德 angry]]
    Sigrid was too lazy to waste words with him. Taking advantage of Vlad's bones being separated, his inability to recover quickly, and his arrogant open mouth threatening, the crimson sword in her hand struck out like a dragon once more. [[7180 旁白 neutral]]
    "Crack!" [[7181 旁白 neutral]]
    A crisp sound of bone cracking echoed in their ears. The slender rapier pierced through Vlad's entire head from his open mouth as if there were no obstruction. [[7182 旁白 surprised]]
    First a throat-slit, then dismemberment, and finally a headshot. Vlad's eyes were wide open, full of the expression, "Why are you so skilled?" [[7183 旁白 surprised]]
    When Sigrid delivered the third strike, Vlad's body suddenly exploded into a mist of blood. The blood mist condensed into a delicate bat, spreading its wings and flying high, landing in the center of the altar, next to the cross where the Wind Saintess was bound. [[7184 旁白 neutral]]
    As the shadow twisted once again, Vlad stood behind the inverted cross, fully recovered, his eyes coldly fixed on the three individuals opposite him. [[7185 旁白 neutral]]
    "Very well, you have successfully angered me. Now I will make you understand what despair is!" [[7186 弗拉德 angry]]
    "First, you, Avilla. You should know very well the fate of those who betray me!" [[7187 弗拉德 angry]]
    Vlad pointed at the stiff Avilla, his eyes burning with rage as if they were about to burst forth. [[7188 旁白 angry]]
    Although Vlad loved to forcefully "corrupt" other people's loyal subordinates, he personally hated those who betrayed him the most! [[7189 旁白 angry]]
    He only enjoyed seeing others being betrayed, the painful expressions giving birth to hatred were his favorite spiritual delicacy, but with him, betrayal was unforgivable. [[7190 旁白 angry]]
    "Those who betray me, di—" [[7191 弗拉德 angry]]
    Before the word "die" could fully escape, a red light flashed instantly. With a smooth cut, the head and body separated for the first time. [[7192 旁白 neutral]]
    Behind him, Sigrid, who had fully spread her bat wings, had just beheaded him with a single sword. [[7193 旁白 neutral]]
    Slender fingertips gently caressed the blade, which still had the blood of a sixth-rank Grand Duke on it. [[7194 旁白 neutral]]
    Higher-ranked blood kin had strong control over lower-ranked blood kin, and this control reached an absolute level over those who were embraced. [[7195 旁白 neutral]]
    At this moment, as long as Vlad personally uttered that sentence, within a few seconds, Avilla's body would uncontrollably self-destruct and die. [[7196 旁白 neutral]]
    Fortunately, Sigrid had cut off Vlad's head in time, preventing him from fully speaking the words that would determine Avilla's life or death. [[7197 旁白 neutral]]
    But was the danger truly resolved? [[7198 旁白 neutral]]
    In Avilla's line of sight, Vlad's head separated from his body and fell, and in that instant it took to drop to the altar floor, it seemed infinitely stretched. The golden-haired blood kin girl's pupils, which had just slightly settled, instantly contracted in terror. She saw— [[7199 旁白 fearful]]
    Vlad's head falling through the air towards the ground, his expression shifted from astonishment, then his mouth instantly regained its shape and curved into a sinister arc. The severed head smiled as it hit the ground, his lips moved slightly, and even without a throat, he still uttered the most crucial word. [[7200 旁白 fearful]]
    "Die!" [[7201 弗拉德 angry]]
    Although he didn't know why Avilla had betrayed him, or why she could ignore his first command, no matter what, for the second command, he directly used his bloodline power. This time, Avilla, whether she wanted to or not, her body would absolutely obey his will. [[7202 弗拉德 angry]]
    Die, my lowly slave who betrayed me! [[7203 弗拉德 angry]]
    Your former master is about to become my new bride, and your value will be completely squeezed dry here. How dare you betray me? Then I shall strip you of your eternal life and scatter your soul! [[7204 弗拉德 angry]]
    Crimson ripples spread out, once again successfully affecting Avilla's frozen body. [[7205 旁白 neutral]]
    The command was successfully issued, and Vlad's head, which had crashed to the ground, showed a look of satisfaction. [[7206 旁白 happy]]
    He seemed to already see the scene of the girl, her face contorted in agony, falling to the ground and struggling painfully for a few short, agonizing seconds before dying in despair. [[7207 旁白 happy]]
    After all, he had enjoyed such scenes more than once, and each time he saw it, it made his mood exceptionally good that day. [[7208 旁白 neutral]]
    As he expected, Avilla, struck by the crimson ripples, soon showed hideous black veins beneath her pale skin. This was a prelude to her body backfiring and exploding! [[7209 旁白 fearful]]
    Facing such a command from a higher-ranked blood kin to a lower-ranked blood kin, this time, no matter how strange the new blood kin's methods were, it was absolutely impossible to stop this process. [[7210 旁白 neutral]]
    In his perception, the blood kin girl, whom he believed was impersonating Sigrid, indeed did not make a move. She merely quietly put down her sword, like a cold bystander, looking down at the tip of the rapier touching the ground. [[7211 旁白 neutral]]
    The red-haired witch had no ability, nor any reason, to save this fourth-rank blood kin, who was previously an enemy. Fate was sealed, and there was no turning back! [[7212 旁白 neutral]]
    But Vlad, immersed in triumph and satisfaction, felt the air was terrifyingly silent. His head rolled a few times on the ground, and as if by fate's arrangement, it just happened to roll to Avilla's feet, who was about to be forced to self-destruct. [[7213 旁白 neutral]]
    The rolling head finally stopped face up, directly meeting the eyes of Avilla, who was bowing her head in pain. [[7214 旁白 neutral]]
    Vlad wanted to admire the tragic and beautiful expression of this golden-haired girl before her death, but why, from the eyes of this dying blood kin girl, did he only read a hint of a smile? [[7215 旁白 surprised]]
    The girl's lips moved, uttering two words. [[7216 旁白 neutral]]
    "Idiot!" [[7217 艾薇儿 angry]]
    "?!" [[7218 弗拉德 surprised]]
    Then, he saw an unbelievable scene— [[7219 旁白 surprised]]
    Avilla's crimson pupils were quietly occupied by a pair of white wings. The girl he had personally embraced as a blood kin actually regained her original ink-colored pupil at this moment, with the Seal of Freedom, representing authority, at the center of her pupil. [[7220 旁白 surprised]]
    "Snap!" [[7221 旁白 neutral]]
    At the same time, he felt one of the thin lines he had been using to control Avilla suddenly snap in his mind without warning. [[7222 旁白 surprised]]
    Wait! [[7223 弗拉德 surprised]]
    He wanted to shout these two words, but with only a head and no throat or vocal cords, he couldn't make any sound. [[7224 旁白 sad]]
    In the last five seconds, the golden-haired girl regained control of her body. Serafina's expression suddenly became resolute. She gripped the crucifix spear in her hand and threw it towards the girl on the cross without hesitation. [[7225 旁白 neutral]]
    "Whoosh!" [[7226 旁白 neutral]]
    Like an arrow released from a bowstring, the crucifix spear accurately pierced through the chest of the girl on the cross. In an instant, blood splattered, and the blood-stained spear tip automatically stirred up a fresh breeze, rapidly flowing into the wound. [[7227 旁白 neutral]]
    In the last three seconds, Serafina, having finished everything, wore a mocking smile. She looked at the silver-haired man on the ground, whose eyes were truly wide with fury. [[7228 旁白 neutral]]
    "Next time you embrace a Saint Nun, remember to check their blessings beforehand, Clown Duke!" [[7229 塞拉菲娜 angry]]
    At the very last moment the words fell, the skin completely overtaken by eerie black veins finally could no longer hold up and burst, "Pfft," with a soft sound, the slender figure instantly exploded into countless blood flowers. [[7230 旁白 sad]]
    And at that very instant, the tip of Sigrid's rapier just touched the ground. [[7231 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ding~" [[7232 旁白 neutral]]
    A barely perceptible "ding" sound, yet it stirred circles of azure ripples in the depths of Sigrid's red eyes. [[7233 旁白 neutral]]
    Time seemed to stand still for that one second. [[7234 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[7235 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[7236 旁白 neutral]]
    Within his mental consciousness, the world enveloped by the crimson moon suddenly collapsed. Feeling the violent shaking of the ground, Vlad's pupils slightly contracted, then he looked incredulously at the girl kneeling on the ground. [[7237 旁白 surprised]]
    "What exactly do you want to do?!" [[7238 弗拉德 angry]]
    What happened outside was also synchronized into his separate consciousness that had invaded others' mental space. What happened outside had already greatly disrupted his plan, and this woman, who was clearly about to be subdued, unexpectedly went crazy at the crucial moment. [[7239 旁白 angry]]
    "Destroying your own mental space, what good does that do you?" [[7240 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Vlad didn't understand the meaning of Celestine doing this. [[7241 旁白 neutral]]
    He was just a separated consciousness. Even if this consciousness space collapsed, the most serious damage to his main body would be like suffering a mental severance. Although the mental injury was severe, it was far from fatal. [[7242 旁白 neutral]]
    Sacrificing the life of a Saintess, just to take away a part of his soul? [[7243 弗拉德 surprised]]
