Chapter 102: Watching the Tigers Fight from a Mountain (Two in One) [[5955 旁白 neutral]]
"Just as I expected, this coffin is already empty." [[5956 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Back on the surface, Lopeia looked down at the other coffin she had brought up with her. The lid was pushed aside, revealing nothing inside. [[5957 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't surprised by this at all. After all, when she created her double and brought the sealed coffin out, she had already sensed no magic or life fluctuations inside it. [[5958 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, the dark night sky was covered by a vast crimson light. Lopeia looked up, sensing something, her blue, water-drop-like pupils reflecting the scarlet pillar of light that reached from the ground to the heavens. [[5959 旁白 neutral]]
Her sensitivity to life allowed her to clearly detect every related life fluctuation in the air. In the dead of night, an ancient and powerful being had awakened. [[5960 旁白 fearful]]
"They really are moving fast..." [[5961 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
She whispered to herself. [[5962 旁白 neutral]]
The Blood Clan had planned all of this, so naturally, they wouldn't give the humans any chance to breathe. The first coffin was moved by Seraphina's spatial matrix. When Seraphina was later revealed as a "traitor," the first coffin was of course not sent to the Cathedral of the Wind God, but directly to the mastermind. [[5963 旁白 neutral]]
As for the second coffin, the empty one she brought out, its contents must have been taken out beforehand. It made sense. The Rose Earl emerged from the sealed pool, so he could get close to the seal and act in advance. [[5964 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, their attention was drawn to the first coffin, which was causing a commotion, so they didn't notice the vampires' actions were already underway in secret. [[5965 旁白 neutral]]
With the body from the first coffin and the soul from the second, the Blood Clan could fully resurrect the Blood Archduke who was sealed for a thousand years by the witches and werewolves. [[5966 旁白 fearful]]
"Are they so impatient that they chose to unseal it right here?" [[5967 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
The bloody light in the sky continued to expand. A serious look flashed in Lopeia's eyes. She raised her hand, and pure, wet water elements began to gather. [[5968 旁白 neutral]]
"Stop, Evelyn. There's no need anymore." [[5969 梅黛亚 neutral]]
Suddenly, a hoarse but incredibly familiar voice came from behind. Lopeia turned in astonishment and blurted out. [[5970 旁白 surprised]]
"Grandma Medea!" [[5971 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
Standing behind her, dressed in a priest's robe, was the true leader of the Kempfa Church, Priestess Medea. [[5972 旁白 neutral]]
"Before the blood-red light appeared, I had already evacuated all the residents. You know, this town's history is not simple, so there are many ancient tunnels left underground." [[5973 梅黛亚 neutral]]
Medea, with her white hair and kind face, looked to be in her sixties or seventies, but age had not bent her body. When she returned to her homeland, the old priestess still stood tall and straight. [[5974 旁白 neutral]]
Lopeia's first reaction upon seeing Medea was not panic or a desire to hide her identity, but a pleasant surprise. [[5975 旁白 surprised]]
In the town, besides Grandpa Ango, only Grandma Medea knew her true identity. After all, when Father Ango arranged for her official identity, he would have needed the consent of a priest of the same rank. [[5976 旁白 neutral]]
Andre's weekly Sunday mission to escort high-grade holy water to the Roland Cathedral was not a lie. Under Ango and Medea's arrangement, Andre was indeed supposed to deliver a portion of the holy water he produced to Grandma Medea at Roland Cathedral for her to handle. The rest of the holy water could then be legitimately called a supply from Roland Cathedral. [[5977 旁白 neutral]]
This was why his two identities, Andre and Evelyn, never appeared on the same day, and Isabella never suspected a thing—the act was thorough, and the secret was well-kept. [[5978 旁白 neutral]]
"Grandma Medea, I'm sorry, I couldn't..." [[5979 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
"It's not your fault, my dear Evelyn. Fate is like that. What is meant to happen will happen." [[5980 梅黛亚 neutral]]
A trace of guilt flashed in the blue-haired girl's eyes, but Medea showed no sign of blame. Her clear, wine-red eyes were filled with grandmotherly kindness as she reached out a withered hand to touch the girl's face, her voice full of affection. [[5981 旁白 neutral]]
"Grandma Medea, as a witch, you already foresaw this day, didn't you?" [[5982 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
Lopeia held Medea's thin hand, her voice filled with worry. [[5983 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems that while I was away, our little Evelyn learned many new secrets~" [[5984 梅黛亚 neutral]]
"I'm truly sorry for hiding my identity from you. The ancient history buried in this land should have been handled by us old folks who have one foot in the grave. I never thought you would get involved..." [[5985 梅黛亚 sad]]
"No, you don't have to apologize. This is my duty." [[5986 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Although Lopeia's voice was gentle and soft, it was firm and clear. [[5987 旁白 neutral]]
"You've grown up, my little Evelyn." [[5988 梅黛亚 happy]]
Medea's dry knuckles brushed through the girl's smooth hair, the tenderness in her eyes as an elder seeming to melt the girl. [[5989 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, these restless fellows will come eventually. But since they're here, we are not completely unprepared..." [[5990 梅黛亚 neutral]]
"A thousand years ago, the werewolves and witches were able to end the Blood Clan's rule here. A thousand years later, there's no reason we should fail!" [[5991 梅黛亚 angry]]
When the blood-red light in the sky expanded to a certain point, the bloody veil that seemed to cover the entire night sky suddenly collapsed toward a central point. The power released from the unsealing responded to the call of the awakened body, and the soul's fluctuation swept across the night sky like a pair of giant, invisible hands. [[5992 旁白 fearful]]
"Ding!" [[5993 旁白 neutral]]
Priestess Medea's withered fingers gripped an ancient holy silver scepter. The clear "ding" sound seemed to ring a silent, thousand-year-old bell. [[5994 旁白 neutral]]
Where the base of the scepter touched the ground, pure white ripples, not illusory but tangible light patterns, spread out in an instant, like waves from a stone thrown into a calm lake. [[5995 旁白 neutral]]
At the top of the scepter, the gem known as the "Stone of a Myriad Stars" suddenly burst with a dazzling light that was impossible to look at directly! A thousand streams of faint light shot up into the sky, towards the countless stars. The silk-like light became an invisible fuse, piercing the crimson curtain and connecting precisely to every visible star in the sky. [[5996 旁白 neutral]]
"With the stars as my witness, and the earth as my foundation, the ancient pact has not faded!" [[5997 梅黛亚 angry]]
Medea's voice was no longer hoarse, but loud like a great bell, filled with unquestionable authority and immense magical power, echoing through the night sky of Kempfa Town. [[5998 旁白 neutral]]
"Awaken, sleeping starlight! Form, dome of protection!" [[5999 梅黛亚 angry]]
[Secret Star Art - Starry Formation - Thousand-Ray Protection] [[6000 旁白 neutral]]
Following her solemn declaration, the countless stars, triggered by the Stone of a Myriad Stars, seemed to respond at once. Countless pure, cold pillars of starlight, filled with the ancient power of the cosmos, were no longer faint but solid beams, crashing down from the heavens! [[6001 旁白 neutral]]
Between the pillars of starlight, countless fine, silver-blue threads of light spread and intertwined rapidly, forming a huge network of starlight that covered the entire town in the blink of an eye. [[6002 旁白 neutral]]
Just as the barrier created by the witch using the power of the stars was about to close completely, the awakened being in the night sky, without waiting to fully absorb the remaining blood energy in the air, moved and transformed into a blood-red meteor, rushing through the final gap in the barrier just as it closed. [[6003 旁白 neutral]]
Vlad looked at the empty coffin, then at the star barrier rising from the ground, and couldn't help but applaud with delight. [[6004 旁白 happy]]
"It seems our Duchess, who has been sleeping for many years, wants to greet her old friends as soon as she wakes up. Ah, it's a conversation between old acquaintances. It's not suitable for us outsiders to interfere..." [[6005 弗拉德 happy]]
"In that case..." [[6006 弗拉德 neutral]]
The silver-haired, demonic man raised his right hand and snapped his fingers. [[6007 旁白 neutral]]
"Snap!" [[6008 旁白 neutral]]
Crimson moonlight instantly formed a strange ritual altar. The base of the altar rotated with ancient magic totems, making the entire structure float in the air. [[6009 旁白 neutral]]
"Then let's not waste any time. We'll awaken my bride right here. I want her to witness her own territory turn to ash and completely abandon her human identity~" [[6010 弗拉德 happy]]
"Yes." [[6011 艾薇儿 neutral]]
In the center of the altar stood an inverted cross made of ebony. The two landed on the floating altar, and Avril personally placed Celeste on the cross. As the girl was positioned in a pose almost identical to the cross, chains suddenly appeared and shackled her white wrists and ankles. [[6012 旁白 neutral]]
After doing all this, Avril, like an obedient maid, folded her hands at her stomach and stepped aside. [[6013 旁白 neutral]]
"Everything is ready as you commanded, Master." [[6014 艾薇儿 neutral]]
"Excellent..." [[6015 弗拉德 happy]]
Vlad admired the Saintess imprisoned on the cross. The unconscious girl's face and neck still bore the marks of thorns, and her long golden hair swayed in the night wind. This broken and forbidden scene made Vlad's blood run faster. [[6016 旁白 happy]]
"Ah~ so beautiful. Truly a body nurtured by divine blood. Such a perfect body will be mine to enjoy from now on!" [[6017 弗拉德 happy]]
At this moment, Vlad finally understood why those old immortals in the demon world were always talking about Saintesses. Now he understood... [[6018 旁白 happy]]
A perfect beauty with high combat power, a noble status, and divine political influence. If you catch one, she can be both a merit and a wife. She's the best of the best! [[6019 旁白 happy]]
"Master, shall we begin now?" [[6020 艾薇儿 neutral]]
Avril suggested from the side. [[6021 旁白 neutral]]
"No, no, no, not yet. Let's watch the show from up here for a while. When they're almost done fighting, when there's blood, when they're crippled, then we'll wake up my bride. Let her witness this wonderful scene and transform completely in despair!" [[6022 弗拉德 happy]]
Vlad looked down with great interest, in no hurry. [[6023 旁白 neutral]]
In his view, Kempfa was finished. Duchess Cayetana was an existence even older than him. Even if she was weak after being sealed for a thousand years, a sixth-tier was still a sixth-tier. As long as she got a chance to drink blood, the terrifying recovery ability of the Blood Clan would show these foolish humans what fear was. [[6024 旁白 neutral]]
The Wolf King and the Witch who had sealed the Duchess were long dead, and their descendants no longer possessed the power and ferocity of their ancestors. The Wolf King's lineage had completely declined, with only a sparse bloodline scattered among the residents of this remote town, unable to make any significant waves. [[6025 旁白 neutral]]
The Witch's descendants, however, had retained some of their ancestor's style. He had witnessed the magnificent scene just now. Using the power of the night stars, the old and frail witch could probably barely touch the threshold of the fifth tier. [[6026 旁白 neutral]]
A fifth-tier witch with a home-field advantage against a weakened sixth-tier Blood Clan Duchess. Vlad watched as if observing a common insect fight, sitting down on the edge of the altar. His brow furrowed slightly at the sight of a touch of azure. [[6027 旁白 surprised]]
"How did a fifth-tier Stigmata Warlock suddenly appear in this small place?" [[6028 弗拉德 surprised]]
He turned his head in confusion to look at the gentle, blond vampire girl standing behind him and asked with narrowed eyes. [[6029 旁白 neutral]]
"Avril, do you know what's going on? Is it some high-ranking priest from the Church? Or reinforcements the witch invited from the White Tower?" [[6030 弗拉德 surprised]]
"I'm sorry, Master. Among the clergy I know, there is no mysterious blue-haired lady. As for the White Tower, although the sages of the White Tower cooperate with the Church, their interactions are limited, so I don't know either." [[6031 艾薇儿 neutral]]
Avril reported everything she knew like an emotionless machine. [[6032 旁白 neutral]]
"Is that so~ A fifth-tier power. In your human empire, that's considered a sage. Even in our demon world, they're qualified to compete for the title of a Great Demon Lord. For such a high-level power to suddenly appear in this godforsaken place..." [[6033 弗拉德 surprised]]
"Master, are you worried that this..." [[6034 艾薇儿 fearful]]
"No, no, no, why should I be worried~" [[6035 弗拉德 happy]]
Vlad interrupted Avril's words, his vibrant lips curling into an exaggerated smile, his scarlet eyes blooming with joy. He suddenly spread his arms like a madman and laughed without restraint. [[6036 旁白 happy]]
"Hahahaha... this is so interesting! An old, frail fifth-tier witch against a sixth-tier duchess is a bit too much of a stretch. I thought this fight would be over quickly, but now there's another fifth-tier. That's more like it! Let the fight have more suspense, let this good show give me something to look forward to!" [[6037 弗拉德 happy]]
After laughing, he placed his hand on the sword at his waist. His white-gloved hand stroked the ebony hilt, his handsome, demonic face filled with pleasure and a complete lack of concern. [[6038 旁白 happy]]
"Avril, you may have misunderstood my meaning. Although we are of the same clan and both are dukes, Cayetana's life or death means nothing to me. I released her only to follow my own plan." [[6039 弗拉德 neutral]]
"As a noble, to be killed by weak livestock, that is the fate destined for Duchess Cayetana. But if she survives and returns to the demon world, she will inevitably affect your influence within the Blood Clan, Master..." [[6040 艾薇儿 fearful]]
"Heh, who told you she could return unharmed even if she wins?" [[6041 弗拉德 happy]]
Avril was stunned, her blood-red eyes flashing with confusion. [[6042 旁白 surprised]]
"Forgive your slave Avril for not understanding, Master's meaning is..." [[6043 艾薇儿 fearful]]
"A sixth-tier Blood Archduke. My purpose in waking her was not to let her shake my authority or escape my control. Since I could awaken her, I naturally left something on her." [[6044 弗拉德 neutral]]
"Although high-tier blood nobles are hard to kill, it's not impossible... If the once-proud Duchess Cayetana is really killed by two weak lesser beings, then her remains can be used as a sacrifice~" [[6045 弗拉德 happy]]
Vlad stroked his chin, gazing at the moon. No one knew what he was thinking. [[6046 旁白 neutral]]
"Sacrifice?" [[6047 艾薇儿 surprised]]
"Avril, don't you think you've talked a bit too much today?" [[6048 弗拉德 angry]]
"S-sorry, Master! This slave deserves death, this slave deserves death!" [[6049 艾薇儿 fearful]]
Frightened by a sidelong glance from Vlad, Avril trembled all over, her knees went weak, and she collapsed onto the altar, kowtowing and apologizing desperately without any dignity. [[6050 旁白 fearful]]
"Alright, I'm in a good mood today, so I won't hold you responsible for now. Besides, although you are my slave now, you are also of the Blood Clan. There's no harm in telling you some things~" [[6051 弗拉德 neutral]]
"The so-called sacrifice is a vessel for the Merciful Father's descent. As a former holy nun of the Church, you should have heard of His honored name." [[6052 弗拉德 neutral]]
Under Vlad's playful gaze, Avril's face went blank. It was as if the mere thought of the terrifying being's true name made her soul tremble uncontrollably. [[6053 旁白 fearful]]
"C-Cain..." [[6054 艾薇儿 fearful]]
