Chapter 24: Reset 24 - Undead Killer MAX [[1409 旁白 neutral]]
"Believe me, Master. After you have fallen, you will surely go after them and drag back that brother and sister you just swore to protect." [[1410 玛拉 neutral]]
Mara was certain of this, because she had experienced it firsthand. [[1411 旁白 neutral]]
Once the demonic degeneration is complete, a power far beyond that of mortals will not only warp the body but also twist the mind, stripping away all sense of shame, faith, and honor. The moral boundaries once held sacred by humans will be instantly shattered by overwhelming desire. [[1412 旁白 neutral]]
This is the birth of a new demon, a being completely superior to mortals. [[1413 旁白 neutral]]
Mara didn't think she was doing anything wrong. In fact, she believed that after his fall, the young noble before her would thank her passionately. [[1414 旁白 neutral]]
Thank her for leading him out of suffering, thank her for helping him understand the true meaning of life! [[1415 旁白 neutral]]
"Is that so? But it's hard to believe such words coming from the mouth of a demon..." [[1416 塞伦安 fearful]]
Perhaps because he had sent the siblings away and was no longer held back, Selen An's trembling body stabilized. He did his best to stand straight in the blizzard, his gaze meeting Mara's violet demon eyes without hesitation. [[1417 旁白 neutral]]
This small act slightly shocked Mara. In the empire, a nation heavily influenced by the Church, looking a demon in the eyes was taboo. People firmly believed that meeting a demon's gaze would contaminate both body and soul. [[1418 旁白 surprised]]
Commoners would often run to a church in a panic to pray after supposedly seeing a demon, and nobles were even more convinced of this, often washing their eyes with holy water after seeing something unclean just to be safe. [[1419 旁白 neutral]]
"Master, your changes are truly surprising me more and more." [[1420 玛拉 surprised]]
"I should be the one who is surprised. To infiltrate a saintess's family so quietly, and even get close to a direct blood relative... your identity as a governess supposedly sent by the Pope, and the power behind you, are truly something else..." [[1421 塞伦安 surprised]]
"That's because of human foolishness and greed. You don't need to be confused by it, Master. Once you are reborn, all these questions will be answered. For now, you just need to close your eyes and entrust yourself completely to me..." [[1422 玛拉 neutral]]
The distance between them was less than ten meters, and Selen An showed no sign of running. In reality, at this distance, even if her prey tried to flee, a succubus would give them no chance to escape. [[1423 旁白 neutral]]
What surprised Mara even more was that the greatly changed Master Selen An did as he said, standing perfectly still. He seemed to have given up all resistance, his expression completely relaxed as he closed his eyes. [[1424 旁白 surprised]]
Has he accepted his fate? [[1425 旁白 neutral]]
Mara thought so, and the smile on her face grew wider and more unrestrained. [[1426 旁白 happy]]
The outcome was set. There would be no divine intervention this time. The only threat was already surrounded by the demon cavalry led by General Kegesa. Although that burst of ice magic had startled everyone for a moment, but... [[1427 旁白 neutral]]
It was meaningless. A Saintess was powerful on her own, but unless she reached the legendary demigod level, a powerful individual on the battlefield could still be overwhelmed by numbers. If the Ice Saintess had brought her personally-appointed Holy Knights to this fight, the outcome might have been different. [[1428 旁白 neutral]]
But there are no 'ifs' in this world. This generation's Ice Saintess was an idiot. Trying to snatch someone from a cavalry legion led by a demon general all by herself would only end with her own capture. [[1429 旁白 neutral]]
By the time she was finished here, the demon general would have probably captured that little wench. Once she became a prisoner, the Saintess's so-called noble blood and status would only further ignite the demons' desire to defile and corrupt her. [[1430 旁白 neutral]]
This plan was undoubtedly a great success. [[1431 旁白 happy]]
Mara stood before Selen An. The blue-haired boy still showed no sign of resistance. He just stood quietly in the snow with his eyes closed, like a statue. [[1432 旁白 neutral]]
"Get ready to be reborn!" [[1433 玛拉 happy]]
Mara declared, and at the same time, her left hand gripped his neck to hold him still and prevent his escape, while her right hand, with fingers slightly curved, rested gently on the top of the young man's head. [[1434 旁白 neutral]]
The best way to activate the Succubus Seed's magic was to pour it in from the crown of the head. That way, the fallen one's soul would be completely saturated with the demonic aura. This was a step she knew from personal experience—just as she had accepted General Kegesa's baptism in her own moment of despair. [[1435 旁白 neutral]]
Everything seemed to be heading in an uncontrollable direction. Just like him now, he seemed to be unavoidably falling into the abyss of demonic degeneration. [[1436 旁白 fearful]]
He had nowhere left to run. Or rather, even if he had chosen the dirty tactic the original owner of the body might have used—sacrificing the siblings to buy time—he didn't think he could escape a succubus's pursuit. He believed this was a turning point of fate, an unavoidable intersection. [[1437 旁白 fearful]]
If that was the case, running was not an option and would be the act of a shameful coward. Fate had pushed him onto the stage, pressing a gun to his forehead. Fear was meaningless. So, why not bet this free life and use his remaining courage to burn the hand holding the gun? [[1438 旁白 angry]]
At the very least, before the threads of fate pierced his limbs, he could make the hand playing with his destiny feel the same pain he felt! [[1439 旁白 angry]]
Even though the demonic power flowing from the top of his head was filled with restless desire, he could clearly feel his body temperature dropping, being drawn away. It felt as if his humanity was gradually leaving him... [[1440 旁白 fearful]]
Did I mess up? But if I don't take this chance, what other choice do I have? [[1441 旁白 fearful]]
The curve of Mara's smile grew wider. Her magic had already seeped into his body and touched the Succubus Seed. Although a layer of sealing ice covered the seed, it couldn't stop her. After all, the ice was not a sealing spell, it had only frozen the seed's development. [[1442 旁白 neutral]]
Her magic was constantly melting the ice, and it was doing so quickly. Once it was all melted and the Succubus Seed was activated, then... [[1443 旁白 neutral]]
"Ssssh!" [[1444 旁白 neutral]]
A sharp sound, like a ghoul sizzling in the sunlight, was followed by a burning pain that spread from his abdomen to his chest. The agony forced her to stop the spell. She opened her eyes, and what she saw was the young man's pale, mocking smile. [[1445 旁白 surprised]]
Her body fell back. Her combat instincts made her leap backward, creating distance between them. The pain was like a shot of strong medicine, making her back break out in a cold sweat. What terrified her most was the sword that had appeared out of nowhere in his hand. [[1446 旁白 fearful]]
From its design, it didn't look like a sword for fighting. It looked more like a sacred object used for court ceremonies or worshiping gods. [[1447 旁白 neutral]]
Mara bent over, clutching the gruesome wound that stretches from her abdomen to her chest, and gritted her teeth. [[1448 玛拉 fearful]]
"A-a holy sword?!" [[1449 玛拉 surprised]]
"Idiot. Did you really think I would just give up?" [[1450 塞伦安 angry]]
Selen An panted heavily. Although the holy sword in his hands was a light one-handed sword by design, in his current state, he needed both hands to hold it tightly. [[1451 旁白 neutral]]
His pale face showed a hint of excitement. He mocked the fearful and furious succubus from a distance, like a child who had just turned the tables in a game, his faint fear mixed with an unstoppable excitement and nervousness. [[1452 旁白 happy]]
He had gambled correctly. This body might be useless, but it had inherited the direct bloodline of a Saintess. No matter how incapable he was, there was still some magic to be squeezed out of it. [[1453 旁白 neutral]]
When he first arrived, he was too unfamiliar with this body, let alone how to use the pitiful amount of magic within it. But ever since hearing that mysterious voice, he found himself becoming more and more familiar with this body that wasn't his, so familiar that it felt like it had been his all along. [[1454 旁白 neutral]]
The status panel showed that a holy sword was among his treasures. Since he chose to rise up and fight against fate, this sword was the only weapon he could bring out—although the description said it was an unsharpened sword. [[1455 旁白 neutral]]
But judging from its actual effect, unsharpened was fine. While it lacked the physical damage of a blade, the holy sword's magical damage against demons was maxed out. [[1456 旁白 neutral]]
Whether he won this battle or not wasn't the point. But before he lost this cheap life, he had to at least take an arm to make it even! [[1457 旁白 angry]]
Selen An thought to himself, his hands gripping the hilt of the holy sword even tighter. [[1458 旁白 angry]]
