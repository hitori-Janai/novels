Chapter 74 Slaughter [[4193 旁白 neutral]]
    The devout priest willingly put on the chains of restraint, exchanging his miracle-creating magic for unparalleled strength and speed. [[4194 旁白 neutral]]
    [Power-Speed Dual-A] was triggered at this moment. No one expected that the priest, a professional primarily focused on the divine magic school, would one day become an anomaly with strength and speed surpassing even a warrior. [[4195 旁白 surprised]]
    With both strength and speed reaching A, this kind of abnormal data is unique even among berserkers of the same Third Tier. If forced to compare, these two stats have almost reached the high level of a Fourth Tier War Lord. [[4196 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre remained silent, simply stacking both speed and strength attributes. Facing an unconquerable enemy, his super intelligence told him it was time to use super strength! [[4197 旁白 neutral]]
    Steam, released like an explosion, surged freely. Torn flesh healed at a visible rate. His nearly perfect torso and muscle lines were covered with sacred golden chain patterns. Anderson stood bare-chested, his golden hair washed silver-white by the rush of this immense power. [[4198 旁白 neutral]]
    All the Nine Vampires were stunned by the scene before them. They had never witnessed such a situation. Even with the previous visual cues, they still relied on experience, considering this white-robed priest a frail cleric with a slight grasp of martial arts, stubbornly believing his main output method was still the divine magic of blessings. [[4199 旁白 surprised]]
    But this surging, raging steam, those perfectly sculpted muscles, and the undisguised, overflowing killing intent in those green eyes... [[4200 旁白 fearful]]
    Are you sure they are facing a Third Tier priest, and not a Fourth Tier War Lord? [[4201 旁白 neutral]]
    But reality left them no time for further thought. Andre, in his transformed state, merely tilted his body slightly. In an instant, the ground beneath his feet cracked like a spiderweb. A fragmented white light, like a rapidly falling comet, sliced through the air with the sound of a blade! [[4202 旁白 neutral]]
    The game's description for speed attribute levels was like this: [[4203 旁白 neutral]]
    When speed reaches A, you will gain bullet-surpassing speed when fully unleashed! [[4204 旁白 neutral]]
    And reality was indeed like that. Andre's speed was faster than bullets, and this group of vampires, who hadn't fully become alert, clearly couldn't react to bullets. [[4205 旁白 neutral]]
    Even if their vampire bloodline-enhanced eyes could slow down captured dynamic movements by several times, no one could imagine that someone in reality could actually charge at them with bullet-surpassing speed. [[4206 旁白 fearful]]
    As the unlucky first one standing at the forefront of the formation, his vision barely caught a blurry trajectory. Before his body could react, the cold blade had already lightly grazed his neck, like cool water lightly touching skin. Before the pain could transmit to his brain, his head had uncontrollably rolled off... [[4207 旁白 fearful]]
    "Eh, why is my body... above my eyes?" [[4208 陌生男1 surprised]]
    At this moment, this final thought floated in his mind. Then, darkness seized his will. From the incision on his neck, foul-smelling blood gushed like a spring. [[4209 旁白 fearful]]
    Andre's two strikes were extremely decisive: one decapitation, one heart penetration. With both vital points attacked simultaneously, even a vampire would have to obediently return to nature. [[4210 旁白 neutral]]
    The death of their kin struck their arrogant pride like a heavy hammer. The gushing blood stimulated their nerves until endless rage mixed with a hint of fear, and they let out almost a roaring sound. [[4211 旁白 angry]]
    "Despicable human畜, you ambushed us!" [[4212 陌生男1 angry]]
    "Kill him, kill him quickly, at all costs!" [[4213 陌生男1 angry]]
    "Everyone from above, come down! Quickly, don't let him escape!" [[4214 陌生男1 angry]]
    With their roars, black shadows descended from all directions, and the ghouls they controlled once again surrounded Andre in a siege. [[4215 旁白 neutral]]
    The Blood Clan members abandoned their arrogance, vowing to tear this arrogant human to shreds. [[4216 旁白 angry]]
    There was no panic or fear in the priest's eyes. Just as he stood there today, since he had made a decision, the option of retreating had been extinguished. [[4217 旁白 neutral]]
    He did not fear death. Rather, this body was the furthest thing from death in this world. The feeling of pain might also make his eyes burst, but that was fine, that was fine... [[4218 旁白 sad]]
    If blood and pain could slightly cleanse the sins on him, then he would readily accept such a result. [[4219 旁白 sad]]
    "So, fight with me..." [[4220 旁白 neutral]]
    "Just like the most primitive beasts, may the shedding of our sinful blood slightly please the gods watching over this place!" [[4221 旁白 neutral]]
    The twin swords merged, accompanied by a bone-chilling grinding sound and splashing sparks. The round glasses reflected a moon-like white light, and the heavy sword in the priest's hand once again assumed the form of a cross. [[4222 旁白 neutral]]
    "Amen!" [[4223 旁白 neutral]]
    Under the moonlight, he roared in a low voice, as if stirring all the blood in his body to boil. [[4224 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[4225 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[4226 旁白 neutral]]
    "What? The reconnaissance team sent out has completely lost contact?" [[4227 旁白 surprised]]
    "How could such an important matter only be reported now?! You good-for-nothings!" [[4228 旁白 angry]]
    Along with a cold question and furious curses, there was the sound of glass and porcelain shattering. The tall man seated at the head of the table, in a fit of rage, swept all the expensive tableware off the table. A goblet filled with crimson liquid fell and shattered on the ground, spilling the sweet virgin blood of a young girl. [[4229 旁白 angry]]
    Viscount Rex lay prostrate on the ground in fear. The glass fragments that splashed when the goblet shattered cut his cheek. Even though high-quality luxurious blood, which he normally found hard to enjoy, flowed on the ground, his body remained tightly pressed against the cold ground, not daring to move. [[4230 旁白 fearful]]
    At this moment, he could only keep his eyes tightly closed, trying his best to endure the rage from the Rose Earl above. [[4231 旁白 fearful]]
    This was the absolute suppression of higher vampires over lower vampires. Even as blood nobles, a Viscount was still as humble as a doormat at the entrance of a tavern before an Earl. [[4232 旁白 neutral]]
    But none of this should have happened, he thought to himself. [[4233 旁白 neutral]]
    A while ago, he was just an ordinary Baron. But the highly esteemed Rose Earl, from the same family, suddenly sought him out. The Earl not only bestowed upon him noble blood but also enfeoffed him as a Viscount. [[4234 旁白 neutral]]
    Such a great kindness, Rex naturally had to repay with his life. And the Rose Earl indeed had something to entrust to him. The words revealed that he simply needed to gather people to infiltrate a small town in the heart of the empire. [[4235 旁白 neutral]]
    Vampires are a race skilled at hiding. Due to their close resemblance to humans in appearance, and most vampires possessing the ability to disguise themselves as perfect human figures, vampires account for the highest proportion of demons lurking within the empire. [[4236 旁白 neutral]]
    Infiltrating a small town was not difficult for vampires. As long as there were enough subordinates and hounds, they could slowly breed weak humans into livestock in the shadows. This was a common method used by vampires. [[4237 旁白 neutral]]
    Not only that, the Earl would also provide him with devices and means for spatial teleportation, funds and blood to recruit subordinates, and enough hounds... [[4238 旁白 neutral]]
    The Rose Earl promised him that if he handled this matter well, he would have the opportunity to reach even the status of an Earl, because the one who orchestrated this entire affair was that "Great One"... [[4239 旁白 neutral]]
