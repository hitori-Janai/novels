Chapter 111: Craving Death [[6526 旁白 neutral]]
    "Sabelia..." [[6527 旁白 neutral]]
    Cayetana's gaze shifted from initial shock to a distant confusion. This name was not unfamiliar to her; in fact, it was exceptionally profound. [[6528 旁白 neutral]]
    In her mind, the image of the stunning mermaid empress was slowly sketched out by memory: clear, pure white waves, the deep blue ocean, and that graceful figure singing a lament. [[6529 旁白 neutral]]
    "Gulp, just kill me." [[6530 卡珊德拉 fearful]]
    Her past self had said this. [[6531 旁白 neutral]]
    "Cassandra, you know, the merfolk never initiate killing." [[6532 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    The mermaid empress, wearing a crown and a long dress, spoke softly. As her emotions changed, the previously raging, turbulent ocean instantly calmed. [[6533 旁白 neutral]]
    "Heh, do you even believe what you're saying?" [[6534 卡珊德拉 angry]]
    Cayetana, the defeated, knelt on the beach, her seductive scarlet eyes filled with mockery. [[6535 旁白 neutral]]
    "If not for killing, not for desire, then why such immense power?" [[6536 卡珊德拉 neutral]]
    Only intelligent races who had personally fought this first mermaid empress would understand that this group of merfolk, who constantly preached peace and were always mediating or on their way to mediate, were actually the most formidable fighters on the entire continent, with their empress being the most outstanding among them. [[6537 旁白 neutral]]
    Who could believe that the beautiful empress, who was now speaking to her kindly and calmly, had been an ocean tyrant capable of unleashing world-ending floods with just an emotional波动 minutes earlier? [[6538 旁白 surprised]]
    There were long-standing rumors on the continent that the docile merfolk were actually overflowing with martial prowess, and strange titles like "warrior fish" even circulated in various places. Now, experiencing it firsthand, it was truly well-deserved... [[6539 旁白 neutral]]
    With the blood of the Second Progenitor flowing within her, she was almost completely suppressed throughout the battle, with no chance to breathe. [[6540 旁白 fearful]]
    Possessing such immense power, it was very easy to become a devil. [[6541 旁白 neutral]]
    Facing Cayetana's mockery and accusations, the mermaid empress's eyes showed no evasion. Her azure eyes sincerely met the girl's scarlet blood-red pupils, each reflecting the other's color. [[6542 旁白 neutral]]
    "Isn't it true? Listen to those who talk about water's extreme softness, but in reality, how many apocalypse stories in human kingdoms were caused by natural disasters like floods?" [[6543 卡珊德拉 neutral]]
    As if to bolster herself, Cayetana began to provide evidence, but this couldn't hide the fact that her voice was getting weaker and weaker. When your strength is inferior, you always lack confidence when speaking, though this was also one of the outcomes she desired... [[6544 旁白 sad]]
    The mermaid empress gazed at the girl's slightly evasive eyes for a while before slowly speaking. [[6545 旁白 neutral]]
    "I know what you're thinking." [[6546 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Huh?!" [[6547 卡珊德拉 surprised]]
    Cayetana was startled. No, can they still communicate amicably? [[6548 卡珊德拉 surprised]]
    You merfolk, cloaked in kindness and peace, have no enemies, can fight, and now you've revealed the ability to read minds. Are you not going to let people live? Just send you directly to win! [[6549 卡珊德拉 angry]]
    "You crave death, but you also fear death." [[6550 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    Her truest feelings were mercilessly exposed, and Cayetana showed a look of shame, turning her face away. [[6551 旁白 sad]]
    "You want to anger me to achieve eternal slumber." [[6552 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Heh, so what? It seems now that you warrior fish are nothing special. In the end, you can't completely kill a blood族 with the blood of a Progenitor." [[6553 卡珊德拉 angry]]
    "I can." [[6554 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Huh?!" [[6555 卡珊德拉 surprised]]
    This was the second time Cayetana had exclaimed in surprise. Immediately, a wild joy surged in her eyes. [[6556 旁白 surprised]]
    The empress of the merfolk, a divine favored race blessed by the Water God with the authority of peace, and a figure on par with the First and Second Progenitors, she indeed had a way to truly kill a blood族. [[6557 旁白 happy]]
    She craved death immensely, craved to escape this monster-like shell. Her father's betrayal of his human identity had already deeply saddened her, but she never expected that her father, who had become the Second Progenitor, had completely lost his humanity. He actually went against her will and personally embraced her, his own daughter, into becoming a monster just like him! [[6558 旁白 sad]]
    After becoming a blood族, she saw countless people look at her with fawning and envious gazes. In their eyes, becoming an immortal blood族 was a supreme blessing, but Cassandra only felt sorrow. If a life cannot even embrace death normally, then life itself has become incomplete, and the spirit will eventually be twisted into a pathological, chaotic form over the long years... [[6559 旁白 sad]]
    But just as Sabelia said, she longed for death immensely, yet life instinctively craved to exist in this world. [[6560 旁白 neutral]]
    "But I won't do that." [[6561 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Why? Am I not evil enough? If you kill me, you can indirectly save countless people who might be killed or threatened by me. Isn't that your purpose and..." [[6562 卡珊德拉 angry]]
    "Peace never requires active killing." [[6563 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    The empress interrupted the girl's anxious speech. [[6564 旁白 neutral]]
    "Just as you asked before, I can answer you now: possessing great power and maintaining peace are not contradictory. Peace is hard-won and easily shattered. I never ignore the goodwill of living beings in the world, and I will never underestimate the malice that intelligent beings will inevitably produce..." [[6565 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Before true peace arrives, resistance is necessary, and strength is indispensable." [[6566 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "The power in our hands is for peace, and only for peace. As for judging your potential future sins, that is the duty of the Ice Saintess. Besides that, I have no right to take any life." [[6567 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "You can't kill me, nor can you save me. You preach about the righteousness of peace, yet you are truly cold and ruthless, Sabelia..." [[6568 卡珊德拉 sad]]
    The blood族 girl, having lost all hope and possibility, completely collapsed and slumped onto the beach, her eyes lifeless. [[6569 旁白 sad]]
    "No, you will be saved." [[6570 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    "Heh, that sounds like a benevolent lie." [[6571 卡珊德拉 sad]]
    The blood族 girl's voice became completely hoarse and lifeless. [[6572 旁白 neutral]]
    "I promise you, a Saintess never lies. At least from my generation onwards, there will be such a rule." [[6573 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    Sabelia, the victorious mermaid empress, actually squatted down to meet Cassandra's gaze, the defeated. She gave due respect, and her words were full of gentleness. [[6574 旁白 neutral]]
    "You will be saved. As for the time, I cannot give an exact answer. Perhaps it will be me, or my next successor, or perhaps after countless years, the compassion of a certain deity, but whichever possibility, this is my promise." [[6575 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    The blood族 girl's gaze became completely confused and perplexed. [[6576 旁白 surprised]]
    "You, why would you make such a promise? As you just said, you have no reason to kill me, nor to save me, I..." [[6577 卡珊德拉 surprised]]
    "Because you asked me for help, that's all." [[6578 莎蓓拉 neutral]]
    ... [[6579 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[6580 旁白 neutral]]
    Yes, the Water Saintess never lies; this was a rule established starting from her. [[6581 旁白 neutral]]
    As for that promise, although the memory had long become blurred by the erosion of time, the words spoken by the maternal and supremely gentle empress on that day are still clear to this day. [[6582 旁白 neutral]]
    To be honest, she had complex emotions towards Sabelia, the mermaid empress and the first Water Saintess, but these emotions completely disintegrated with one fact. [[6583 旁白 neutral]]
    It was Sabelia who gave this generation's Water Saintess the name Lobelia, but the truth is— [[6584 旁白 neutral]]
    Sabelia, is already dead... [[6585 旁白 sad]]
