Chapter 33 Reset 33: The Will Not to Fight [[1913 旁白 neutral]]
Gods! Is this really not a dream? [[1914 安娜 surprised]]
Anna could hardly believe her eyes. The dreamlike scene made her feel a strong sense of unreality. [[1915 旁白 surprised]]
Could any living being in this world be so beautiful? [[1916 安娜 surprised]]
If she wasn't dreaming and everything she saw was real, then perhaps the true face of a god wouldn't be much different. For a moment, a thought that could be considered blasphemous crossed the young girl's mind. [[1917 旁白 neutral]]
The gods are all-knowing and all-powerful, and no mortal is worthy of looking upon their true form. This is why all known public statues of gods in churches are faceless. [[1918 旁白 neutral]]
Although Anna had been oppressed by fate, she had always maintained a proper reverence for every god in the world. But after seeing the reborn Mr. Selen An, she couldn't stop the impulse to replace the face of a god's statue with this magnificent one she had witnessed. [[1919 旁白 neutral]]
She was certain that the holy maiden standing before her was Selen An, just as she had recognized the white-haired succubus lying in the snow. Both had the Ice Saintess Serenia's ice-snow magic seal on the back of their right hands. Anna used this as proof to confirm their identity. [[1920 旁白 neutral]]
Although both the white-haired succubus and the holy maiden before her were far from Selen An's original appearance, she had a gut feeling they were all the same person. [[1921 旁白 neutral]]
A nearly transparent water curtain blocked the spears thrown by the demon cavalry. With the terrifying strength of the demons, the spears they threw could easily pierce hard rock, and their destructive power could tear a large hole through a living person. [[1922 旁白 fearful]]
But their famed brute force was useless against the suddenly appeared blue-haired maiden. The captain of the front-row cavalry squad quickly pulled on his reins, forcing the team to a halt, his幽-green eyes staring uncertainly at the two human females in the snow. [[1923 旁白 surprised]]
For some reason, even though the other party had only blocked their spear attack and showed no killing intent or thought of counter-attacking, the demons' nature should have driven them to charge forward and trample these two seemingly weak women into paste, but... [[1924 旁白 neutral]]
The heart in his chest, not held by fear, lost most of its will to fight in an instant. It wasn't just him; the dozens of cavalrymen behind him were the same. The fierceness in their eyes, the moment they saw the maiden, was like a fire doused by water, instantly extinguished. [[1925 旁白 neutral]]
The bloodthirsty demons, upon seeing easy prey, didn't charge forward to kill but hesitated and pulled their reins. Their instincts were telling them not to make an enemy of the blue-haired maiden before them; she was not an enemy. [[1926 旁白 fearful]]
In the sky, a light rain fell continuously. Even though the air was extremely cold, it wasn't snowing, and the water that landed didn't turn to ice. In the scene captured by the naked eye, the simple substance of water seemed to be given life. It fell downward, gathered upward, it flowed, it clustered, all just to get closer to the flawless, blue-haired maiden. [[1927 旁白 neutral]]
A snow-white, delicate hand gently brushed across Anna's cheek. With sincere apology in her blue, water-drop-like eyes, Lúbèilìyà raised her index finger and carefully, gently wiped away the tear stains on the girl's face. [[1928 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"I'm sorry, Miss Anna, for making you wait." [[1929 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"I... I..." [[1930 安娜 surprised]]
That magnificent face, like a creation of the gods, was right before her. A light, elegant fragrance drifted to her nose as the maiden's hair moved. Anna couldn't adjust to such intimacy for a moment, and her pale, frozen cheeks instantly blushed with shyness. [[1931 旁白 neutral]]
She lowered her head in embarrassment, not daring to meet the maiden's gaze. [[1932 安娜 sad]]
"Don't worry, leave the rest to me." [[1933 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Her gentle, clear, and reassuring voice was like a spring breeze brushing past her ear. Now, not just her cheeks, but the backs of her ears turned completely red. Shyness made her unwilling to look up. As soon as she lowered her head and closed her eyes, Lúbèilìyà's azure, water-drop-like eyes would appear in her mind. [[1934 旁白 neutral]]
The maiden's eyes, as pure and clear as water, seemed to hold a magical power that could purify the soul. She had only ever seen such a gentle gaze in her own mother's eyes, and now, she felt the same motherly love in a completely different pair of eyes. [[1935 旁白 happy]]
It was a generosity that embraced all things, a selflessness that nourished all things. [[1936 旁白 neutral]]
In the end, the desire for warmth and security overcame the young girl's shyness. The blonde Anna let out a soft sound, her face red, as if all her strength had left her, and she completely entrusted herself to the other. [[1937 旁白 neutral]]
Her body swayed, and she leaned into the Saintess's warm and soft embrace, falling completely unconscious. [[1938 安娜 neutral]]
Lúbèilìyà wrapped her arms around the girl's back, letting her head rest as comfortably as possible on her shoulder. Her azure eyes filled with motherly love and radiance. [[1939 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Sleep, sleep, just leave everything to me. Don't despair in fear, don't cry from sorrow, because I am here..." [[1940 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
"Please tell me of all your hardships and fatigue in your dreams. I am willing to listen to your confusion, until the water washes away all the mottled traces..." [[1941 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
"May the water carry your wishes." [[1942 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
Her healing, soothing voice was filled with endless warmth, and her gentle comfort was like the most beautiful lullaby in the world. As the last sound fell, the final trace of a worried frown on Anna's sleeping face completely smoothed out. [[1943 旁白 neutral]]
Here, in this icy world where she had just fought a battle to the death, Anna fell into a deep sleep in Lúbèilìyà's arms. [[1944 旁白 happy]]
After doing all this, she held the girl in her arms like a baby, as careful and gentle as a mother. The surrounding water flowed and turned into the softest silk, silently enveloping and protecting her. [[1945 旁白 neutral]]
On the outside, watching this peaceful yet strange scene, not a single one of the onlooking demon cavalrymen had the thought to take this chance to launch a sneak attack. The atmosphere between the two was too peaceful, especially the holy, blue-haired maiden. Her entire being seemed to radiate a special divine power that made it impossible for anyone to be her enemy. [[1946 旁白 neutral]]
Even the bloodthirsty and battle-hardened demons could not avoid it. [[1947 旁白 neutral]]
The reason this cavalry squad was still here was simply because they were stunned by the scene before them. All the water elements between heaven and earth were controlled by the maiden, and the character she displayed was identical to the properties of water. [[1948 旁白 neutral]]
Gentle, tolerant, selfless, non-confrontational... [[1949 旁白 neutral]]
She had so many virtues that one could feel and be convinced of just by looking into her clear eyes. [[1950 旁白 neutral]]
Most demons lack human emotions and despise so-called morality, but the radiance emanating from the maiden was like the instinctive security of being wrapped in a mother's womb before birth. [[1951 旁白 neutral]]
This was a kind of... kindness that no living creature could refuse. [[1952 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, even when facing the demons, who were recognized as evil by all races of the Nephalem continent, not a trace of disgust or hatred flashed in the maiden's eyes. [[1953 旁白 neutral]]
Instead, she just calmly observed the world, observing every living being in it, like a calm water surface reflecting the clearest, most true form of everything that came near her. [[1954 旁白 neutral]]
The water flowed slowly forward with Lúbèilìyà's steps. Whether it was the rain falling from the sky or the ice melting on the ground, everything related to water followed her steps closely, like the most loyal servant. [[1955 旁白 neutral]]
The demon cavalry squad, feeling no hostility at all, stared blankly as Lúbèilìyà walked toward them. Normally, if prey came so close, the demons' blades or spears would have already pierced through their soft bellies. [[1956 旁白 fearful]]
But this time, the squad of more than a dozen cavalrymen, aside from the initial spear throw, had not launched a single attack. For the bloodthirsty demons, this was simply unimaginable. [[1957 旁白 surprised]]
What was even more incredible was that when the maiden, holding the sleeping Anna, had come right in front of them, the cavalry captain only needed to pull his reins, and his demon steed could have easily knocked them down, trampling the two seemingly weak girls into paste. [[1958 旁白 fearful]]
But none of that happened. The demon cavalrymen held their reins, but when they saw the maiden approaching, they instinctively pulled them to carefully control their warhorses and make way... [[1959 旁白 neutral]]
Just like that, they willingly gave up the military merit that was right in front of them, quietly watching the holy figure until she was completely out of sight. A long time later, the squad captain dazedly came back to his senses, his幽-green demon eyes staring blankly at the now-empty snowfield. [[1960 旁白 sad]]
They had already left, right under his nose. The only thing left was a line of still-clear footprints in the snow. [[1961 旁白 neutral]]
Even though he had personally sent them off, not a single one of the dozen demon cavalrymen felt any regret or unwillingness, even after coming to their senses and snapping out of that strange state. [[1962 旁白 neutral]]
