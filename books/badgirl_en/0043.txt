Chapter 43: Reset 43 - Violating Heavenly Rules [[2461 旁白 neutral]]
Rejected and scorned by the world, regarded as an enemy by all living beings. [[2462 旁白 sad]]
With things reaching this point, Kagsa didn't understand: where did he go wrong? [[2463 旁白 surprised]]
Thinking carefully, every step he took was logical. Even when facing the unexpected trouble of the Water Saintess, he calmly judged the limits of her abilities. [[2464 旁白 neutral]]
As long as he seized this weakness, at most both sides could only maintain a stalemate, and the advantage would still be on his side... [[2465 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't believe the magic power consumed to maintain this domain was so little that it could delay until the situation reversed. Once the Water Saintess's magic power was exhausted, the heavily injured Ice Saintess would no longer be a threat, and it would be his time to slaughter. [[2466 旁白 angry]]
He was like a leopard hiding in the grass, waiting for the defending prey to expose weaknesses due to fatigue. But why did he suddenly fall to a state of being scorned by all living beings? [[2467 旁白 sad]]
Thorns cut his skin, vines bound his joints, pouncing lions tore at his flesh, and huge brown bears struck his skull with their thick paws... [[2468 旁白 fearful]]
Normally, these common animals were merely objects for demons to enslave or use as food. Powerful demons could freely slaughter and destroy these weak lives. But now, a force had united all living beings, and all animals and plants had a common enemy. [[2469 旁白 fearful]]
When many weak forces united and formed a single rope, even against demons, it could make these once powerful demon individuals feel powerless, as if the whole world was against them. [[2470 旁白 fearful]]
That's right... [[2471 旁白 neutral]]
In endless pain and torment, Kagsa seemed to understand some things in an instant. He recalled the question Lobelia had emphasized, and when she said it, the girl's eyes were especially serious. [[2472 旁白 neutral]]
Also, the holy sword in her hand had some subtle, unnoticeable changes. [[2473 旁白 neutral]]
Was it then? [[2474 旁白 surprised]]
"Ugh...!" [[2475 克格萨 fearful]]
Kagsa, being devoured alive by the wild beasts, finally couldn't help but scream. The powerful life force of demons made him not so easy to die. He once regarded this as an inherent pride and symbol of power for demons, but now, this ability only made him experience more, and more unbearable pain. [[2476 旁白 sad]]
He even prayed in his heart for death to come faster. To be eaten by unintelligent wild beasts and animals was simply the greatest insult to his soul as a noble High Demon! [[2477 克格萨 angry]]
But he was powerless. When he personally said he chose to be an enemy of that girl, the girl didn't choose to raise her sword. But within the range influenced by him, all living beings showed their fangs at him. [[2478 旁白 fearful]]
"I've already given you a chance..." [[2479 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia gazed at the bloody, incomplete demonic figure in the beast group. She crossed her fingers and placed them on her chest, in a prayer pose. Her azure, tear-drop eyes remained pure and compassionate. [[2480 旁白 neutral]]
Kagsa was caught in the strangulation of beasts and plants, unable to fight back. This proved that the [Pact of Non-Aggression] was still active. As for why the [Pact of Non-Aggression] was active, Kagsa was still injured and bleeding. [[2481 旁白 neutral]]
The reason was simple: the [Pact of Non-Aggression] only applied to intelligent beings, because only intelligent races would start wars. Battles between wild animals and plants were purely for basic survival. [[2482 旁白 neutral]]
The compassionate goddess would forcefully end a war solely for profit because of the loss of life, but she would not foolishly stop any struggle, because she understood that bleeding and death were also meanings of life's continuation. [[2483 旁白 neutral]]
This was the most basic law of nature. [[2484 旁白 neutral]]
So all of Kagsa's guesses were not wrong. The [Pact of Non-Aggression] restricted his enemies, but also himself. Without a way to solve the root cause of war, war could never truly end. [[2485 旁白 neutral]]
However, his powerful life force and rich experience, while making him successful, also narrowed his perspective in some ways. Years of fighting led him to confine his enemies simply to intelligent races like the Church, the Empire, and the Divine Kin, but he had forgotten... [[2486 旁白 neutral]]
Before the gods bestowed wisdom, knowledge, and magic upon these races, these non-intelligent plants and beasts could also take their lives with tough hides, sharp teeth, claws, and even venom. [[2487 旁白 neutral]]
Serenia witnessed this breathtaking scene and, for a short time, even forgot to breathe. [[2488 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
It was almost impossible to describe this feeling with words. Her exceptional talent clearly allowed her to see some clues. Just as Lobelia said, she had actually given the other party a chance. It was the arrogant High Demon himself who hadn't noticed, and by the time he did, it was too late. [[2489 旁白 neutral]]
Lobelia never intended to kill him from beginning to end. This might have been the Saintess's mercy, or perhaps compassion born from already knowing the outcome. The Water Saintess would not personally kill any living being. Even though Kagsa showed his hostility and murderous intent throughout, the Saintess still did not choose to raise her sword against him until the very end... [[2490 旁白 neutral]]
However, the Saintess chose to let him go, but that didn't mean other living beings would spare him. [[2491 旁白 neutral]]
Raising a sword against the representative of the Goddess of Peace and Life meant raising a sword against all living beings in this world. [[2492 旁白 neutral]]
The Saintess offered you mercy. If you refuse to be merciful, then mercy will be forced upon you. [[2493 旁白 neutral]]
Although the Saintess would not force it, being regarded as an enemy by all living beings, from a certain perspective, was even more terrifying than being directly granted death. [[2494 旁白 fearful]]
Of course, the Saintess herself would naturally not control these, nor could she. [[2495 旁白 neutral]]
Now it seemed that the Water Saintess did indeed inherit the Water God's benevolence, but this benevolence was by no means a soft target in some people's eyes. Once you saw her benevolence as weakness and started conflict, you would instantly understand what it meant to violate heavenly rules. [[2496 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, compared to the Ice Saintess who symbolized judgment, the Fire Saintess who symbolized war, or the Light Saintess who symbolized justice, only the Water Saintess, who symbolized peace, was truly the most difficult to provoke. [[2497 旁白 neutral]]
She loved peace and was benevolent, and would never fight back when threatened. But if you truly dared to provoke or act, then one day, lightning might strike you, or you might be surrounded and devoured by wild beasts in the wilderness. Then you could only consider yourself unlucky~ [[2498 旁白 neutral]]
Among the beast pack, Kagsa's blood stained the beasts' manes, adding a touch of gore to the battlefield. The demon's body was like a natural perpetual motion machine; as soon as a piece of flesh was torn from his thigh, the skin on his arm healed itself. As soon as he painfully drank a mouthful of arterial blood from his left arm, the muscles in his right arm recovered... [[2499 旁白 fearful]]
In short, the beasts welcomed a carnival of flesh and blood. As for Lobelia, who stood by, the blue-haired girl gently closed her eyes, her fingers crossed, swaying like a willow in the wind, simply praying. [[2500 旁白 neutral]]
As life reached its final moments, Kagsa also stopped his last struggles. He clearly felt his last shred of life force being scraped away by sharp fangs. His bloodshot pupils stared lifelessly at the sky until his consciousness gradually blurred, as if his soul was about to leave this body that would soon turn into bones. [[2501 旁白 sad]]
"I... won't let you go, Water God's dog... Lobelia!!" [[2502 克格萨 angry]]
Until the last moment of his life, he let out a hoarse, venomous sound like a curse. An invisible soul wave swept across the entire battlefield in an instant. [[2503 旁白 fearful]]
Serenia, sensing that this aura was wrong, suddenly tensed, and rushed desperately towards the girl's back, shouting. [[2504 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
"It's a soul self-destruction, quickly dodge!" [[2505 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
