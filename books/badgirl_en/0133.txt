Chapter 133: At This Moment, Elsewhere [[8273 旁白 neutral]]
    "Lady Bailianna, are we just leaving like this?" [[8274 小修女 neutral]]
    Inside the carriage, a small nun who was helping the young lady with government documents looked at the scenery constantly moving away outside the window. Finally, she couldn't help but ask with concern. [[8275 旁白 neutral]]
    "If not, should we stay here and rebuild the disaster area for them?" [[8276 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    The silver-haired young lady looked through the documents in her hand and said calmly. [[8277 旁白 neutral]]
    "No, no, no, I didn't mean that, I just feel..." [[8278 小修女 neutral]]
    The small nun quickly waved her hand, regretting her talkativeness just now. [[8279 旁白 neutral]]
    "I know what you're thinking. You just think that we traveled all this way, got out of the car, took a look, and then left. Windermere territory is in the middle of disaster rebuilding, and we're leaving without helping. It feels a bit embarrassing." [[8280 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    The young lady's tone was calm, but the meaning of her words was extremely direct, scaring the small nun's face pale. [[8281 旁白 fearful]]
    She was just a nun; how could she dare to discuss the relationships and etiquette between those of higher status? Especially with the very special status of a Saintess. [[8282 旁白 neutral]]
    "Alright, I didn't say I was going to punish you. Don't always look at me like I'm a monster." [[8283 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    The young lady looked up and spoke to comfort her. The small nun saw no anger in Bailianna's ice-blue eyes, which relieved her slightly. [[8284 旁白 neutral]]
    "I apologize, Lady Bailianna, I shouldn't have spoken so carelessly just now." [[8285 小修女 sad]]
    "It's nothing. Young people often make such mistakes. From a normal person's logical point of view, it's normal for you to have doubts." [[8286 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    Bailianna put down her quill, her hands gently resting on her joined white-stockinged thighs, her expression still calm. [[8287 旁白 neutral]]
    "In fact, we have already given them the most needed help. The box contains a treasure called the Stone of Ages. This treasure was given to my sister by the Rock Saintess. That stone contains extremely impure power of time. If used properly..." [[8288 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    The young lady's tone paused, and a rare subtle arc appeared at the corner of her mouth. [[8289 旁白 neutral]]
    "It can restore the ruined land we just saw to its original state." [[8290 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "This, this..." [[8291 小修女 surprised]]
    The small nun covered her mouth, already so shocked that she was incoherent. [[8292 旁白 surprised]]
    If what Bailianna said was true, such power was almost no different from the miracles recorded in historical books. [[8293 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is it really that amazing?" [[8294 小修女 surprised]]
    Perhaps Bailianna's words were too unbelievable, but the young and curious small nun still couldn't help but ask. [[8295 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course, that is a creation of a god. Do not doubt the power of gods, and likewise, do not trust the benevolence of gods. Among the gods who have survived to the present world, none of them do not have divine blood on their hands." [[8296 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    The small nun held her breath tightly. She didn't understand why Lady Bailianna suddenly told her such taboo words. If those words just now were heard by some fanatical devout believers, they would be completely classified as blasphemy. [[8297 旁白 fearful]]
    "Forget it, what's the point of me suddenly telling you this?" [[8298 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    Perhaps realizing she had said something she shouldn't have, Bailianna shook her head and picked up the documents on the table once more. [[8299 旁白 neutral]]
    "Lady Bailianna, are we just returning like this then?" [[8300 小修女 neutral]]
    Perhaps after hearing the silver-haired young lady's disrespectful words just now, the small nun also felt her courage grow. After a long silence in the carriage, she tentatively spoke. [[8301 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course not. Returning empty-handed is not my style." [[8302 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "But now the clues are completely cut off. The only information we have is a leveled ruin. Without intelligence, how can we determine the direction to search?" [[8303 小修女 sad]]
    "Alas, why do young people now dislike thinking so much?" [[8304 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    Bailianna sighed, and the cool aura around her seemed to dissipate quite a bit with that sigh. [[8305 旁白 neutral]]
    "Do you think I gave out the Stone of Ages just to help them rebuild their homeland?" [[8306 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "?" [[8307 小修女 surprised]]
    The small nun widened her eyes, and her delicate face seemed to be writing "Isn't it?" in large characters. [[8308 旁白 surprised]]
    "Honestly... why is everyone so disinclined to use their brains?" [[8309 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    The young lady shook her head, looking a bit helpless. [[8310 旁白 neutral]]
    "Do you think that the Wind Saintess didn't come to personally receive us this time just because she was busy with disaster relief?" [[8311 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "?" [[8312 小修女 surprised]]
    The small nun's eyes remained wide, seemingly unchanged from the beginning. [[8313 旁白 surprised]]
    "Alright, I shouldn't have expected you to understand..." [[8314 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "The Wind Saintess's unwillingness to receive us might have some reasons related to disaster relief, but it is definitely not the main reason. Even if she was too busy to split herself, according to etiquette, she should have at least sent a Holy Nun to welcome the special envoy. But what did she do?" [[8315 贝莲娜 angry]]
    Bailianna snorted lightly, and her ice-blue eyes flashed briefly. [[8316 旁白 angry]]
    "Heh, assigning a sectional Knight Commander to receive the special envoy group. She's practically afraid we won't know she's hiding something." [[8317 贝莲娜 angry]]
    The more the small nun listened, the more alarmed she became. She unconsciously covered her mouth with her hand. She felt as if she had suddenly been drawn into a struggle between two great Saintess factions. Although afraid, she instinctively felt excited. [[8318 旁白 fearful]]
    "Having caused such a big commotion, she also knows that some things cannot be hidden. Our arrival is just a coincidence. Facing the invasion of an evil god into the mortal world, the Pope will certainly send someone to investigate. And that Wind Saintess whom we haven't met, although her actions now seem normal, if one has some understanding of her past personality, one would know..." [[8319 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "Celeste, the Saintess of Freedom and Wisdom, she has never been one to seek attention. Going around to various places for disaster relief with such fanfare now, wishing people would spread her whereabouts and deeds at all times. On the surface, it seems she wants to establish a glorious image through this event, gather popular support, and thus stabilize her originally unstable position as a Saintess. But in reality..." [[8320 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "Whether it's her current grand actions or deliberately assigning a sectional Knight Commander to receive the special envoy, the true purpose is merely to concentrate most of the attention or blame on herself, thereby allowing some details that should have been noticed or discovered to remain hidden." [[8321 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    After speaking so much in one breath, Bailianna felt a bit parched. Fortunately, although the small nun was curious, her professional etiquette was not bad. Seeing Bailianna lower her eyes and remain silent, she quickly poured a cup of warm honey water and offered it. [[8322 旁白 neutral]]
    Bailianna took the jade-like porcelain cup and elegantly took a sip. The moderately warm pure water, combined with the royal jelly honey special to Einville territory, moisturized the young lady's somewhat dry throat, and a hint of comfort appeared on her usually expressionless face. [[8323 旁白 happy]]
    Seeing the young lady in a good mood, the small nun, whose curiosity was piqued by half-explained analysis, still couldn't help but cautiously ask. [[8324 旁白 neutral]]
    "Lady Bailianna, is there, is there more?" [[8325 小修女 curious]]
    The young lady glanced at the gossip-filled face of the small nun, snorted softly, but there was no blame in her eyes. [[8326 旁白 neutral]]
    "You, don't listen to my words like a story. You should also use your brain when listening, or next time such a good assignment might be snatched away by a smarter sister than you." [[8327 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    Bailianna couldn't help but offer a timely reminder and continued. [[8328 旁白 neutral]]
    "In fact, the matter is already very clear. That day's red and blue light, even far away in our Glacies territory, was seen by some people at the border. The pure water element contained within it is an undeniable fact..." [[8329 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "Such a massive magical fluctuation, such pure control of water elements, capable of triggering a forbidden water spell in a short time. Water elements are mild and tend to be supportive. Few people can unleash such fierce and vast power with this element. Even the few Water Sages in the White Tower probably don't have such ability, so the only possibility is..." [[8330 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "...Lady Water Saintess." [[8331 小修女 neutral]]
    The small nun swallowed her saliva and answered nervously. [[8332 旁白 fearful]]
    "Hmm, you finally answered this time. If you hadn't been able to explain it just now, I really would have wondered if you were a fool." [[8333 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "Hehe~" [[8334 小修女 happy]]
    The graceful nun couldn't help but show a cute, silly smile and scratched her head. [[8335 旁白 happy]]
    "Although I don't know exactly what happened then, I can roughly guess that the Water Saintess and the Wind Saintess reached some kind of cooperation or agreement. During the invasion of the evil god, the Water Saintess must have played some irreplaceable important role. As a reward or compensation, after the incident ends, the Wind Saintess will surely spare no effort to cover up, or even erase, the traces of the Water Saintess from this matter." [[8336 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "But what does this have to do with the Stone of Ages you just mentioned?" [[8337 小修女 neutral]]
    The small nun couldn't help but interject. [[8338 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course it's related. As the saying goes, if you don't want people to know, don't do it. In this world, as long as you do something, you will definitely leave traces. That Celeste must understand this simple truth. With her wisdom, the easily collected traces at the scene have probably already been dealt with by her..." [[8339 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    "If we were to forcefully collect evidence, it's not impossible, but it would probably take a lot of time. By then, even if we got key clues, once time passes, the Wind Saintess's goal would have been achieved. I don't like being led by the nose, so..." [[8340 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    At this point, Bailianna's face finally showed a hint of the slight cunning a girl her age should have. [[8341 旁白 happy]]
    "I left a small trick on the Stone of Ages. As long as someone uses the Stone of Ages to restore the ruins we just saw, I can use the backdoor I left to get a complete time-lapse recording of Kempha Town, including not just the visuals but also the sound." [[8342 贝莲娜 neutral]]
    At this point, most of Bailianna's small plan had been revealed, and the small nun was already... completely dumbfounded. [[8343 旁白 surprised]]
    She suddenly felt that girls who could become Saintesses were indeed as clever as monsters. If she were to become a Saintess and confront Lady Bailianna, she would probably lose even her panties in half a day. [[8344 旁白 sad]]
    "But what if the Wind Saintess noticed the anomaly on that stone and chose not to use it?" [[8345 小修女 neutral]]
    "Not use it? She won't. That's her territory, and her fated node. She won't be able to harden her heart~" [[8346 贝莲娜 confident]]
    "She might hesitate, but she definitely won't not use it. It's just a matter of sooner or later." [[8347 贝莲娜 confident]]
    Bailianna looked at the scenery outside the window and confidently curved her lips. [[8348 旁白 confident]]

    ............ [[8349 旁白 neutral]]
    ............ [[8350 旁白 neutral]]
    At this moment, in another secluded inn. [[8351 旁白 neutral]]
    Room 303. Opening the door with a key, a figure completely wrapped in a black robe quickly slipped into the room, closed the door, and after a thorough and meticulous inspection to ensure there were no magical eavesdropping or ambush devices inside, the black-robed figure finally sat down by the bed. [[8352 旁白 neutral]]
    "Phew! I finally shook those people off." [[8353 黑袍身影 neutral]]
    Even though she was wrapped in a loose robe, a closer look would reveal that the loose fabric still couldn't hide the wearer's slender and graceful figure. This was clearly a woman's figure, but the voice that came out was a deep and hoarse male voice. [[8354 旁白 neutral]]
    Perhaps realizing that her voice was wrong, now that she was in a closed and safe place and didn't need to disguise herself, a slender, fair hand reached out from under the hood, and delicate fingertips touched her Adam's apple, coughing twice. [[8355 旁白 neutral]]
    "Cough, cough~" [[8356 黑袍身影 neutral]]
    Her voice changed from rough to gentle, returning to her original vocal range, and the black-robed figure finally felt much more comfortable. [[8357 旁白 neutral]]
    She reached out and took off the hood covering her face, revealing a head of long hair as brilliant as the golden sun. Under the golden hair was a breathtakingly beautiful face, as flawless and ethereal as something from a fairy tale. [[8358 旁白 neutral]]
    Skin as fair as snow, long hair as bright as the golden sun, emerald eyes like precious gems, and a pair of vertical pointed ears hidden beneath her long hair—without a doubt, this was an elf, and a golden elf of extremely pure bloodline. [[8359 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ugh~ I can finally relax. As expected, disguising myself as a man really doesn't suit me at all." [[8360 金精灵 sad]]
    Having temporarily reached a safe area, the golden elf breathed a sigh of relief, and at the same time, a hint of relief flickered in her pure emerald eyes. [[8361 旁白 neutral]]
    She couldn't understand why, despite being careful enough when going out, not only wearing such a loose robe and concealing her aura, but even disguising her voice, some human males in the empire could always accurately pinpoint her whereabouts in the vast crowd? [[8362 旁白 curious]]
    Was it because her aura wasn't thoroughly enough concealed? Or was it because... [[8363 旁白 curious]]
    Miss Elf's gaze fell on the curve created by the robe on her chest, and a hint of distress flashed in her beautiful eyes. [[8364 旁白 sad]]
    Her figure was innate, and it wasn't her fault that she developed too well. What would be a source of pride for ordinary women had now become a burden and a flaw for her. [[8365 旁白 sad]]
    "Do I have to try binding my chest?" [[8366 金精灵 neutral]]
    Miss Elf gestured in the air towards her chest, estimating the feasibility of doing so, but ultimately gave up. The conclusion was that given her size, if she really were to bind her chest, there would still be a noticeable curve, and it would not only be ineffective but also make her breathless, not worth the trouble. [[8367 旁白 sad]]
    Miss Elf, with no plan, lay on the table like a salted fish, then looked up after a while. [[8368 旁白 neutral]]
    This trip's plan had been disadvantageous at every turn. Her mother sent her out to find the Water Saintess, but without concrete clues, she could only rely on the guidance of the elves' innate keen sixth sense to slowly search. [[8369 旁白 neutral]]
    A while ago, she finally had a discovery, but when she arrived at the predicted location, there was only a ruin left. Clearly, she was too late. [[8370 旁白 sad]]
    Working tirelessly for more than half a month and ultimately getting nothing made Wendy, who was out alone for the first time, feel very frustrated. [[8371 旁白 sad]]
    She felt that if she continued to search solely based on her sixth sense, she would never encounter the Water Saintess in her lifetime. [[8372 旁白 sad]]
    "Beloved Mother Goddess of Life, please have mercy on your faithful follower. I need your guidance, even a small hint, to guide us, your lost lambs, on the right path." [[8373 温蒂尼 sad]]
