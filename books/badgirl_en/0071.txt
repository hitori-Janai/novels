Chapter 71: One Man Guards the Pass [[4039 旁白 neutral]]
Today, Andre still woke up very early, so early that the light of dawn hadn't gently touched the town, and even John's big rooster hadn't had time to climb the dirt mound and crow loudly. [[4040 旁白 neutral]]
Before the town's residents had even left their homes, the white-robed priest had already run a full lap around this familiar land. [[4041 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, the man stopped, gently parting the soil with magic. From his pocket, he once again pulled out a silver magic rune, soaked in high-grade holy water. [[4042 旁白 neutral]]
The bright silver metal surface of the rune was engraved with magic patterns related to 'silence' and 'prohibition'. Magic runes like these, buried in advance under the ground at their designated spots, would play a crucial role when needed. [[4043 旁白 neutral]]
After burying the last rune, Andre dusted off his hands and looked up at the sky. Usually, by this time, the morning sun would have risen high, its golden light shining over the earth. But today... [[4044 旁白 neutral]]
Thick clouds hid the sun's light, making the weather slightly gloomy. [[4045 旁白 neutral]]
"This really isn't good weather." [[4046 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre muttered to himself. [[4047 旁白 neutral]]
While drinking at the tavern yesterday, he intentionally or unintentionally conveyed to the townspeople that the Wind God might soon blow away the world's foul winds, and staying outside too long could lead to being harmed by these bad winds, making it unwise to go out. [[4048 旁白 neutral]]
With the prestige Andre had built in the town over four years, the residents would not disbelieve him. The tavern patrons, upon returning, spread the word from one to ten, ten to a hundred, and a hundred to a thousand, naturally achieving a widely known effect. [[4049 旁白 neutral]]
Under the double assurance of early warnings and magic rune prevention, Andre still dared not underestimate today's battle. This was mainly because Sasha's level was too low, and the information she provided was very vague in some specific numbers, making it impossible for him to accurately determine how many enemies he would face tonight. [[4050 旁白 fearful]]
Originally, he had planned to interfere with the enemy's plans in advance, thereby slowing down those with ill intentions towards Kempfer. If he could just delay for another week, the Saintess's personal guards would inspect the area. Then, if he reported this matter through the Saintess's personal guard channel, the Church would send troops to settle everything for them. [[4051 旁白 neutral]]
But he hadn't expected those vampires to be so impatient. This group with Sasha was merely an advance party, intended to initially infiltrate the town. However, regardless of whether the previous squad achieved their goal, a large number of vampires and ghouls would invade Kempfer five days later. [[4052 旁白 surprised]]
As the supreme planner of this scheme, Duke Vlad clearly intended to seize Kempfer Town. A bloodline duke's target must be another duke sealed beneath the church. No matter which force they ultimately intended to strike with their fangs, Kempfer Town would undoubtedly be the first to suffer. [[4053 旁白 neutral]]
His original thoughts had been confirmed as unachievable. Now, as the highest visible combat power in the entire town, he had to step forward and fight with his back against the wall. [[4054 旁白 determined]]
Returning to the church, today's church was also unusually quiet. Thanks to the false information Andre had released in advance, not many believers came here for prayer or confession. Except for a few familiar young nuns performing their daily prayers, Isabella's figure seemed to have disappeared as well. [[4055 旁白 neutral]]
Andre didn't pay attention to these details. He simply returned to his room and listed the items he would need tonight, one by one: [[4056 旁白 neutral]]
High-grade holy water, demon-hunting bullets, Silver Killer, Holy White Flame, various stored auxiliary or offensive magic runes, and the two gunblades he carried with him almost every day. [[4057 旁白 neutral]]
Weapons and magic items were, in the end, merely external aids. The true determinant of victory or defeat in this defense battle would still be him. [[4058 旁白 neutral]]
Andre was certainly not a rigid person. If a situation truly arose where the priest's power couldn't resolve it, she would naturally activate the powers of her other two identities. But once the authority of the Water Saintess was truly used, such a large magical fluctuation would probably be clearly detected even as far away as Roland City, right? [[4059 旁白 neutral]]
Once there was a risk of her identity being exposed, she would have to leave this place. [[4060 旁白 fearful]]
Looking out the window, this was the place he had lived for a year. Compared to the magnificent Winterlein territory, full of wealth but devoid of any warmth or sense of home, he felt that this place was more like his true home. [[4061 旁白 neutral]]
But everything in the world eventually faces parting. Even if this event hadn't happened, he would still have a day when he had to leave here. This was the destiny he bore. [[4062 旁白 sad]]
The arrival of the vampires merely accelerated the coming of that day. [[4063 旁白 neutral]]
Remembering the old man's last words before his death, Andre's feelings grew deeper. [[4064 旁白 neutral]]
"Indeed, the tides of fate push people forward. Even if unwilling, one must still go..." [[4065 安德烈 sad]]
He carefully wiped the gunblade's body with a silk cloth until its surface was smooth as a mirror, clearly reflecting half of his face. [[4066 旁白 neutral]]
Bullets filled the chambers, and the gunblades were tucked into his sleeves. [[4067 旁白 neutral]]
Andre once again came to the church hall. Facing the statue of the Wind God, he, as usual, drew out three incense sticks, bowed three times, and inserted them into the censer, showing his respect for the Wind God. [[4068 旁白 neutral]]
"Amen." [[4069 安德烈 neutral]]
After doing all this, he looked up at the statue of the Wind God again. The stone statue carved from rock remained unchanged. Except for the white smoke curling from the censer, which made the faceless statue a bit more hazy, inanimate objects ultimately couldn't breed divinity or miracles. [[4070 旁白 neutral]]
It seemed the free Wind God had no time to cast her gaze upon a small place like Kempfer. Expecting divine grace was less reliable than the gunblades in his own hands. [[4071 旁白 neutral]]
Just as Andre was about to leave, someone poked him on the back with a finger. Turning around, he saw Sena standing behind him, her delicate face showing a hint of imperceptible worry. [[4072 旁白 surprised]]
"What's wrong? Did Sena encounter some difficulty?" [[4073 安德烈 neutral]]
"No, Father, I have a note here that Sister Isabella entrusted to me for you. It seems to have something she wants to tell you." [[4074 塞纳 neutral]]
Receiving the note, Andre didn't intentionally avoid Sena, but the girl wisely stepped aside. [[4075 旁白 neutral]]
The handwriting on the note was delicate yet urgent, and the paper itself carried a familiar faint fragrance. This was indeed written by Isabella herself. [[4076 旁白 neutral]]
"I have set off to seek aid and can return tonight at the earliest. Wait for me. —Isabella." [[4077 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Just a dozen words, yet one could feel the weight of the departed girl's message, especially the last two words, 'Wait for me.' [[4078 旁白 neutral]]
A subtle curve suddenly appeared at the corner of Andre's usually unsmiling face. He tucked the note into his pocket and walked out of the church without further hesitation. [[4079 旁白 happy]]
He didn't see many acquaintances along the way. Occasionally, he encountered a few playful children who had ignored their parents' warnings and ran out to play. He timely advised them and sent them home. [[4080 旁白 neutral]]
Today passed exceptionally quickly. The man stood on the only main road leading into the town, watching the orange-red sunset slowly disappear into the horizon, his jade-colored eyes deep and solemn. [[4081 旁白 neutral]]
As the sun fell from the sky and night unfurled its skirt, those dormant presences hidden in the darkness began to stir. [[4082 旁白 fearful]]
The white-robed priest used fire to ignite a torn page from the Bible. The moment the flame flared, a pair of crimson eyes suddenly opened at the distant end of the road. [[4083 旁白 fearful]]
Merciless spatial ripples spread out like a dragonfly skimming water. Under the night sky, the roars of monsters tore through the peaceful night of the town. [[4084 旁白 fearful]]
