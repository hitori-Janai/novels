Chapter 113: Containment [[6641 旁白 neutral]]
    In the previous life, there was a legend: one day in heaven was one year on earth. [[6642 旁白 neutral]]
    Lobelia felt that sometimes this kind of spiritual conversation was similar. They had talked a lot, talked for a long time, and even the atmosphere midway became a bit awkward and strange, but in reality, it was only an instant... [[6643 旁白 neutral]]
    Opening her eyes again, the look in Cayetana's eyes was completely different. She slowly withdrew her hand and looked at the divine girl in front of her. [[6644 旁白 neutral]]
    "It's hard to believe, your name really is Lobelia." [[6645 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
    "It seems you've already got the answer you wanted, so there's no need to use force." [[6646 旁白 neutral]]
    Cayetana gazed at the holy sword, with golden blood flowing, in the girl's hand, and her thoughts were briefly pulled back to past memories. This familiar scene, indeed... [[6647 旁白 neutral]]
    Although the Merfolk tribe had no prophetic abilities, the promise given by Sabella was indeed fulfilled a thousand years later. [[6648 旁白 neutral]]
    This person in front of her was the only one who could truly give her salvation. [[6649 旁白 neutral]]
    "A Tier 5 body forcibly casting a forbidden spell, logically, your body should have been torn to pieces by that forbidden power, but you are still standing here, clinging to your last breath..." [[6650 旁白 neutral]]
    Cayetana suddenly looked up, her expression somewhat complex. [[6651 旁白 neutral]]
    "It's the Authority of Life, isn't it? The reason I can stand here and talk to you for so long is also because of the domain formed by the Authority, and I happen to be in the domain right now..." [[6652 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Within the domain, there is no death, so both you and I have locked onto our last chance of survival. But unlike me, if the domain is lifted, I will quickly perish after betting everything, but you won't." [[6653 旁白 neutral]]
    The Vampire girl analyzed as she sensed the magic fluctuations and changes within the domain. [[6654 旁白 neutral]]
    "Perhaps you are right, but please forgive me for not understanding it so well. I only use these powers by instinct and am not familiar with them." [[6655 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The Water Saintess, who never lied, still stated the answer so directly. [[6656 旁白 neutral]]
    "That also makes sense, given your current state... Never mind, let's save the idle chat for later, Lobelia, I ask you, what is your purpose?" [[6657 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "To prevent disaster from happening." [[6658 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Then what do you think is the biggest disaster right now?" [[6659 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "The Tier 6 Duke Vlad." [[6660 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "No, you are wrong. The most dangerous one is not that Tier 6 Vampire, but Cain." [[6661 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "Ca... Cain..." [[6662 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
    The girl tilted her head instinctively when she heard the name, her voice somewhat stiff. She seemed extremely familiar with this name, but when she spoke it with this body, there was always an inexplicable awkwardness. [[6663 旁白 neutral]]
    "Yes, Cain, the legendary first vampire in the world. No, it shouldn't be called legendary, this is a fact. As the first vampire in the world, Cain is called the Benevolent Father by the Vampires. In fact, though his power is not as great as a true god, it has definitely reached the level of a demon god." [[6664 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "It is said that true gods do not descend, and those who descend are not true gods. But this is for rule-abiding gods. Coincidentally, Cain is not among them. That man, who personally turned himself into a monster to gain power, does not care about so-called rules." [[6665 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "Listen carefully, from the moment I was unsealed, that villain Vlad planted a seed within me. Once I fall into a near-death state, that seed will immediately sprout, and Vlad will use me as a sacrifice to summon Cain's descent." [[6666 卡耶塔娜 fearful]]
    What Cayetana didn't say was that her decisive choice before, going all-in, was also because of this. If she won, she would become a puppet controlled by this shameless fellow clansman. If she lost, she would be cruelly used as a sacrifice for a divine descent. [[6667 旁白 neutral]]
    The descent of a god causes great harm to the vessel, so almost every Saintess serves as a natural vessel for descent, but true gods rarely do so. The descent of demon gods and evil gods is not as gentle as that of true gods; in their eyes, the descending vessels are merely sacrifices offered by their believers. [[6668 旁白 neutral]]
    "So, is there anything I can help you with?" [[6669 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "You are truly gentle. I remember we were enemies a few minutes ago. Hearing this news, shouldn't the first thing you do be to kill me immediately and prevent me, this sacrifice, from summoning the terrifying demon god?" [[6670 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
    Facing such an emotionless Saintess, Cayetana seemed to regain some of her past confidence and feeling. [[6671 旁白 neutral]]
    "You didn't show much killing intent towards me, only at the beginning, but you quickly restrained it. Since you were unsealed, you haven't caused any innocent casualties, so from my perspective, I have no right to judge you." [[6672 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Heh, it's just the same old rhetoric, it was like this a thousand years ago, and it's still like this a thousand years later. It can only be said that you two are indeed..." [[6673 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    Cayetana pouted, almost losing the arrogance of a duchess, and instead showed a bit of a young girl's demeanor. [[6674 旁白 neutral]]
    "Killing me is indeed a solution, but even if my soul shatters now, the high-tier Vampire body will maintain high vitality for a period after losing its soul, so it's not excluded that Vlad could still successfully summon Cain using my corpse. The best way is..." [[6675 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "For you to contain me." [[6676 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    The Vampire girl stared intently at Lobelia's face, as if trying to capture some useful emotions from her face the moment she finished speaking. [[6677 旁白 neutral]]
    The result disappointed her. In this state, Lobelia was almost entirely devoid of emotion, except for a fleeting hint of confusion in her eyes after hearing the explanation. [[6678 旁白 neutral]]
    If it weren't for the urgency of the situation, she would have complained on the spot. [[6679 旁白 neutral]]
    "Even if you take me down, you still have to face the pressure of a Tier 6 and a demon god. In this situation, gaining the power of the Vampires can help you solve this problem very well." [[6680 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "I think you should understand what I mean. After all, as the Saintess of Water, you should understand the inclusiveness of water best. Now, all my physical, mental, and spiritual power have been unleashed into a blood tide to contend with your forbidden spell..." [[6681 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "Given that blood water is also water, now, if I completely give up all resistance, you can easily and quickly contain all of me, including my power, body, bloodline, and even my soul." [[6682 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    Cayetana had explained it very clearly, and the girl nodded. [[6683 旁白 neutral]]
    "So that's how it is?" [[6684 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Otherwise?" [[6685 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "Before, when you mentioned gaining the power of the Vampires, I thought you would try to turn me." [[6686 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Heh, don't worry, I won't turn you." [[6687 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    Hearing this, Cayetana couldn't help but laugh. [[6688 旁白 neutral]]
    "Lobelia, if you were just an ordinary Water Saintess, I might really do that, but you are not. I am not qualified to turn you. Even if Cain came, he would not be qualified..." [[6689 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "In this world, no one has the right to force you to become something you don't want to be." [[6690 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
    "So, have you thought about it? To contain all of me..." [[6691 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
