Chapter 118: The Witch's Prophecy [[6928 旁白 neutral]]
In the crimson light and shadow, the memory belonging to the past was dragged out, stained with the color of blood. The soul was imprisoned in a cage called the past, chaotic and sinking... [[6929 旁白 neutral]]
Celeste could clearly feel her warmth being stripped away bit by bit. The human part was becoming less and less. When the physical body that held the soul became unfamiliar, it meant that the last barrier had also disappeared. [[6930 旁白 fearful]]
Celeste clearly knew what she was about to face, but such a dangerous choice was almost the only opportunity in her life. [[6931 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps thinking of this issue, the blood-colored vortex invaded the sea of her mind, stirring up past ripples— [[6932 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, Miss..." [[6933 陌生女1 neutral]]
A familiar voice seemed to be calling her in a daze. [[6934 旁白 neutral]]
Her hazy consciousness, driven by the instinct to awaken, opened her drowsy, blurred eyes. The green-haired girl, half-lying on the desk, raised her head and still somewhat dazed, looked around. [[6935 旁白 neutral]]
She remembered that she was doing something very dangerous, but the familiar boudoir and environment instinctively made her relax. [[6936 陌生女1 neutral]]
"Miss." [[6937 陌生女1 neutral]]
The voice sounded again. Celeste finally saw the source of the voice: black hair, dark eyes, and a fitted black nun's robe. That gentle and familiar face made her instinctively speak. [[6938 旁白 neutral]]
"Sera...Fina." [[6939 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
Because she had just woken up, her eyes were still relatively hazy. Serafina squatted down, reached out, and tentatively touched her forehead, then touched her own forehead to compare body temperatures. [[6940 旁白 neutral]]
"No fever." [[6941 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
She murmured in a low voice, but her worried expression did not lessen much, even though the girl's body temperature was normal. [[6942 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, although it's autumn now and the temperature isn't too low, napping on the desk without any cover still carries the risk of catching a cold." [[6943 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"It's fine, I'm a Saintess! How could I get sick so easily~" [[6944 塞莱斯特 happy]]
Everything was still normal. Celeste chuckled, but what she got in return was Serafina's most serious gaze. [[6945 旁白 neutral]]
Although the contract stipulated that she was the master and Serafina was the servant, logically, only masters would show their displeasure to servants, and servants had never "threatened" their masters with their eyes. However, due to the harmonious, sister-like relationship between the past Wind Saintesses and their Holy Nun Corps, Celeste's generation was no exception. [[6946 旁白 neutral]]
Serafina had almost grown up with her. After years of living together, she was truly afraid of Serafina, a sister-like figure, suddenly showing a serious expression. [[6947 旁白 fearful]]
"Miss has already succeeded to the throne and is now the rightful Saintess. The Saintess's safety concerns the security of the entire Windermere territory and cannot be neglected at all." [[6948 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The ink-haired nun verbally instructed while semi-squatting, slowly tidying the girl's slightly messy hair near her ears from her nap. [[6949 旁白 neutral]]
Celeste comfortably enjoyed the close care of her sister-like "harem," greedily sniffing the faint elegant fragrance from Serafina's hair. [[6950 旁白 happy]]
"Oh~ Although the work of a Saintess is tiring every day, just thinking about being able to enjoy the care of Serafina and the other sisters every day fills me with motivation again!" [[6951 塞莱斯特 happy]]
"Miss is talking nonsense again." [[6952 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The two conversed as usual. Serafina tidied the broken hair by the girl's temples, thoughtfully braiding it into a plait. Just as she was about to withdraw her hand, her body stiffened and paused in place. [[6953 旁白 neutral]]
"What's wrong?" [[6954 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
Celeste, noticing this small action, asked with concern. [[6955 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
"Nothing." [[6956 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The ink-haired girl shook her head and quickly withdrew her hand. As she stood up, she picked up half a stack of documents from the desk and walked towards the door, her figure somewhat like a fleeing animal. [[6957 旁白 neutral]]
But just as she reached the door, the half-open door was just right blown by a gentle breeze, closing with a click. [[6958 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, there are still many government affairs that need my help to process. Now is not the time for playing around." [[6959 塞拉菲娜 angry]]
Facing the closed door, Serafina took a deep breath, her tone once again becoming serious. [[6960 旁白 neutral]]
But this time, Celeste did not back down. [[6961 旁白 neutral]]
"Serafina, I'm not playing with you. I truly want to understand what you're worrying about." [[6962 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
The girl was young when she succeeded to the throne, and her voice still carried a hint of immaturity that hadn't completely faded, but the immaturity couldn't hide her unique aura as a Saintess. [[6963 旁白 neutral]]
Though the Wind Saintess was approachable, she was also a superior. At necessary times, she had to display the dignity of a leader. [[6964 旁白 neutral]]
"You and Isabella have followed me since childhood, and you should know that as the Wind Saintess, lies and concealment cannot deceive me." [[6965 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
"From the moment you woke me, I saw your eyes, and I read deep worry in those dark pupils. So what exactly happened?" [[6966 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
"..." [[6967 旁白 neutral]]
The air fell into a long-lost silence. [[6968 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, Lady Catherine has just returned to heaven, and you've only recently succeeded to the throne. Some things..." [[6969 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"There's no need to worry about that. Mother's health has long ceased to be a secret, and many archbishops had already made predictions before this, so I was well prepared. Sadness is inevitable, but it won't affect my life and work." [[6970 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
The girl's voice was gentle and firm, which made Serafina sigh again. [[6971 旁白 sad]]
"Miss, do you really have to know now?" [[6972 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Of course, it's my duty." [[6973 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
Feeling the girl's tenacity in her eyes, Serafina finally stopped insisting. She walked back to the desk, put the documents down again, and came before her. [[6974 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, you should know that a part of witch blood flows in my body, right?" [[6975 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Mm." [[6976 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
Celeste nodded. As trusted confidantes who took care of the Saintess, Isabella and Serafina's lives were immediately thoroughly investigated by professionals from the Church, including detailed physical examinations and bloodline tests, from the moment Celeste chose them from the orphanage. [[6977 旁白 neutral]]
The bloodline test showed that Serafina had at least half witch blood in her body, meaning Serafina's birth mother was a witch. [[6978 旁白 neutral]]
As for how she became an orphan, that was unknown, as the witch clan's distribution was extremely scattered and their whereabouts mysterious. Even the Church's intelligence network might not be able to fully investigate it. [[6979 旁白 neutral]]
"The witch clan possesses innate prophetic and divination abilities. Divination is a ritual that can be performed repeatedly, while prophecy is a talent, often triggered passively..." [[6980 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Witches with extraordinary talent often receive prophetic guidance in their dreams, and most of these dream prophecies are related to their own future. It's recorded in books that a witch has this kind of prophetic ability three times in her life." [[6981 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The office suddenly became extremely quiet, with only Serafina's narration remaining. [[6982 旁白 neutral]]
"And just last night, I had a strange dream. In the dream, I saw Miss's figure..." [[6983 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
