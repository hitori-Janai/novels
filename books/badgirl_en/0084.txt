Chapter 84: Golden Headshot [[4762 旁白 neutral]]
"Trash!" [[4763 弗拉德 angry]]
A thunderous roar of rage shook the entire castle slightly. In the cold, blue-tinged firelight, Vlad, clad in a blood-red coat, fiercely stomped on the head of Earl Rose on the ground. The brutal light bursting from his crimson eyes seemed as if it would crush the head beneath his foot. [[4764 旁白 fearful]]
In fact, it was. [[4765 旁白 neutral]]
"Crack!" [[4766 旁白 surprised]]
With an explosive sound like a ripe melon, Earl Rose's head instantly shattered into pieces. Blood and grayish-white brain matter splattered everywhere, while the headless body twitched violently as if it had suffered a heavy blow, then slumped powerlessly to the ground. [[4767 旁白 fearful]]
Vlad stepped on the fragmented skull mixed with blood and brain matter, grinding it a few more times on the ground before finally looking at the corpse with cold eyes and speaking coldly. [[4768 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't play dead with me. Your filthy blood is still clinging to the sole of my expensive leather shoe. Clean it up quickly, or else what I'll crush next won't be just your head, but your entire body!" [[4769 弗拉德 angry]]
As his words fell, the already lifeless corpse twitched violently twice. Then, an incredible scene unfolded: the splattered blood, brain matter, and shattered bones returned to the neck of the headless corpse as if time were rewinding. [[4770 旁白 surprised]]
The remaining bone fragments and blood embedded in the sole of Duke Vlad's leather shoe were even drawn back into the reassembling head by an invisible force. The entire process lasted about a minute, and Earl Rose reappeared perfectly intact before Vlad. [[4771 旁白 surprised]]
However, this level of resurrection was not without cost. At the very least, Earl Rose's crimson eyes had dimmed slightly, and his complexion became even paler. [[4772 旁白 neutral]]
Earl Rose, who had just died, had barely stood up before he flopped onto the ground like a dog again. His posture was exactly like that of Viscount Rex, from his perspective, not long ago. [[4773 旁白 neutral]]
"Your subordinate deserves to die! Your subordinate deserves to die!" [[4774 蔷薇伯爵 fearful]]
Earl Rose prostrated himself on the ground, frantically kowtowing. Due to the excessive force, his scalp was scraped open by the stone bricks of the floor, and the freshly cleaned ground was once again stained with blood and tears. [[4775 旁白 sad]]
"Hmph!" [[4776 弗拉德 angry]]
Vlad looked down at Earl Rose, who was devoid of dignity like a dog on the ground, his eyes unashamedly filled with contempt. [[4777 旁白 neutral]]
This was how it was among the vampires: nobles oppressed common vampires, great nobles oppressed minor nobles, and beings of the Duke and Prince rank could directly treat all their subordinate vampires as disposable pawns. [[4778 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, Earl Rose, who was high and mighty before Viscount Rex, had a status no higher than that of a favored female slave in Vlad's presence. [[4779 旁白 neutral]]
Vlad pulled out a silk handkerchief to wipe his hands, which were not stained with any dust, and walked to the castle window. Just then, a bat flew past the full moon and landed precisely in Vlad's outstretched palm. [[4780 旁白 neutral]]
The Blood-Clad Grand Duke looked at the bat in his palm with a morbidly affectionate gaze, then crushed it to death. [[4781 旁白 neutral]]
The bat became a puddle of blood before it could even utter a cry. Miraculously, the blood did not splatter wildly but seemed guided by some force, flying towards a mirror behind Vlad. The blood adhered to the mirror's surface, forming a passage of text. [[4782 旁白 surprised]]
"The Saintess has arrived in Kempfa. The plan may fail. I will arrive shortly. There should be two protectors." [[4783 旁白 neutral]]
The entire message consisted of only 26 characters, yet it contained an immense amount of information, even including details about the Saintess's safety. [[4784 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing that Vlad remained silent for a long time, Earl Rose dared to raise his head and sneak a glance. This glance happened to catch the content of the blood characters on the mirror, which frightened him, and he quickly pulled his head back. [[4785 旁白 fearful]]
"What are you afraid of? You've already seen it all, do you think I'll eat you?" [[4786 弗拉德 angry]]
Vlad's voice suddenly rang in his ear, making Earl Rose's body tremble violently. Cold sweat dripped down his neck onto the ground, making faint but clear splashing sounds. [[4787 旁白 fearful]]
"Please forgive me, Grand Duke. I am willing to gouge out my eyes, to, to..." [[4788 蔷薇伯爵 fearful]]
"Enough! What's the point of all this nonsense!" [[4789 弗拉德 angry]]
Vlad interrupted Earl Rose's trembling speech with disgust. [[4790 旁白 neutral]]
"You speak as if gouging out your eyes would make you forget everything you just saw. Besides, as a vampire earl, what difference does a mere eye-gouging punishment make?" [[4791 弗拉德 neutral]]
Vlad sneered twice, his fingers lightly caressing the residual bloodstains on the smooth mirror surface. A morbid obsession appeared on his pale yet handsome and demonic face. [[4792 旁白 neutral]]
"Raising a bunch of trash like you, who bear the title of nobles on the surface, but are in reality less useful than a female slave I secretly trained." [[4793 弗拉德 angry]]
The plan had just failed, yet the other party had already reported and revealed the target's key location and accompanying personnel. This surprise slightly alleviated his recent anger. [[4794 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, stop kneeling on the ground. Your posture is so ugly it makes me want to vomit." [[4795 弗拉德 neutral]]
Such harsh words, yet Earl Rose felt them to be as gentle as a spring breeze. [[4796 旁白 surprised]]
The Duke's words meant he was still willing to give him another chance. An opportunity meant he could redeem himself. [[4797 旁白 happy]]
Earl Rose hastily scrambled up from the ground, his flustered and comical appearance drawing another sneer from Vlad. [[4798 旁白 neutral]]
"Since you've seen the information on the mirror, you should know what to arrange next, right?" [[4799 弗拉德 neutral]]
"Duke, please rest assured, leave everything to me. This time, I will arrange it clearly and meticulously, with absolutely no more mistakes!" [[4800 蔷薇伯爵 happy]]
Earl Rose continuously expressed his loyalty and gave assurances. In reality, he hated Rex to death in his heart. If he hadn't trusted that good-for-nothing Rex, why would he have suffered such torment? [[4801 旁白 angry]]
He swore that after he returned, he would torment Rex severely, drain his bloodline, turn him into the ugliest ghoul, and then... [[4802 旁白 angry]]
This fantasy in his mind was not yet finished when it was interrupted by Vlad's voice. [[4803 旁白 neutral]]
"Have you forgotten something?" [[4804 弗拉德 neutral]]
"Duke, I..." [[4805 蔷薇伯爵 fearful]]
"As the mastermind of this grand plan, how could I be absent? After all, this time, we are going to welcome the holy Saintess as one of our own~" [[4806 弗拉德 happy]]
"How noble the human Saintess's status is, how noble her bloodline! Only I, Vlad, am worthy of conquering her and giving her the first embrace!" [[4807 弗拉德 happy]]
In the darkness, the blood-clad Grand Duke spread his arms, as if showing off his grand plan and ambition to the world. [[4808 旁白 neutral]]
"As for Duchess Cayetana, I believe she will also be very willing to contribute her part to my plan~ Hahahahaha...!" [[4809 弗拉德 happy]]
Vlad's wild and sinister laughter startled a flock of sleeping bats. Under the congealed moonlight, the wildly flying bats suddenly blossomed into sprays of blood, and as the blood rained down, everything returned to deadly silence. [[4810 旁白 neutral]]
