Chapter 49: Important Information [[2802 旁白 neutral]]
    "Uncle Andre, goodbye! Isabella, goodbye!" [[2803 陌生男1 happy]]
    "May the wind engrave your path." [[2804 旁白 neutral]]
    "Goodbye, little George, see you tomorrow~" [[2805 陌生女1 happy]]
    The sun was setting in the west, and the clouds in the sky were painted beautiful fiery colors by the setting sun. At the entrance of the church, Andre and Isabella waved goodbye to the last town resident who came to the church today. [[2806 旁白 neutral]]
    Watching the child's figure skip away, Isabella, leaning against the doorframe, smiled. She happened to see the man's firm face, a tough, chiseled face that, surprisingly, held a smile that made children feel close to him. [[2807 旁白 neutral]]
    "I didn't expect you to be quite popular with children~" [[2808 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
    Isabella couldn't help but tease him. [[2809 旁白 neutral]]
    "I just listened carefully to what was in their hearts. Every child growing up normally, just like adults, has worries in their hearts. It's just that adults often ignore them because of age, and I just happened to make up for that." [[2810 安德烈 neutral]]
    "They just need the same respect as adults." [[2811 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre adjusted his glasses on his nose, answering seriously. [[2812 旁白 neutral]]
    "Pfft! You're really cute when you answer so seriously, Father~" [[2813 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
    "Just call me by my name, you know, our church doesn't go for that official title stuff, everyone is equal." [[2814 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Oh, your tone of voice is quite like Sister Evelyn's~ But no matter how much you try to learn from her, the children still like her more than you~" [[2815 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
    The setting sun illuminated her profile, and Isabella's silver hair looked especially beautiful against the orange-red light. [[2816 旁白 neutral]]
    "I don't care." [[2817 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre habitually turned his head, not wanting to dwell on this topic too much. [[2818 旁白 neutral]]
    "Right, but speaking of that, Andre, you seem to be the one in this town least impressed with Sister Evelyn, aren't you?" [[2819 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella seemed to think of something, resting her right index finger on her lower lip, her golden-brown eyes full of a girl's slyness. [[2820 旁白 neutral]]
    "Both she and I are clergy, both have two hands, two feet, two eyes, and one mouth. What is there to pay too much attention to?" [[2821 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Hmm... although what you said makes sense, I feel the most important reason is that your times with Miss Evelyn are completely staggered, so you two never get a chance to interact at all." [[2822 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella leaned against the doorframe and stretched, her graceful female figure fully displayed under the remaining sunset light. [[2823 旁白 neutral]]
    "Andre, every Sunday you go to the great cathedral in Roland City to escort high-level holy water, and Sister Evelyn just happens to be on duty at the church only on Sundays. What an unpleasant coincidence~" [[2824 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "It doesn't matter. Anyway, we are all working hard to make this town better, and that's enough." [[2825 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre stood with his hands in his pockets. Under the twilight, his white priestly robe seemed to be covered with a golden glow. His blond hair and blue eyes made the sense of security he gave off even stronger. [[2826 旁白 neutral]]
    Looking at this heroic and extraordinary figure from behind, Isabella gradually stopped smiling, but the brightness in her golden-brown eyes did not dim at all. [[2827 旁白 neutral]]
    "Andre." [[2828 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    She suddenly called his name again. [[2829 旁白 neutral]]
    "I'm here." [[2830 安德烈 neutral]]
    The man's answer was extremely brief, just like his tough exterior. [[2831 旁白 neutral]]
    "Are you really planning to spend your whole life in this town?" [[2832 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella suddenly asked a question completely unrelated to the previous topic, but this time, her tone was not joking, but extremely serious. [[2833 旁白 neutral]]
    "..." [[2834 旁白 neutral]]
    The priest was silent for a moment, then turned around, still with his hands in his pockets. His romantic blue eyes, like those of a poet, gazed at the young and beautiful nun. [[2835 旁白 neutral]]
    "Why do you suddenly ask that?" [[2836 安德烈 neutral]]
    His voice was calm, with no other emotions mixed in his rational words. [[2837 旁白 neutral]]
    "I just think it's a pity. You know, I was only transferred here shortly before old Father Ongo passed away. Although I didn't spend much time with the old priest, I know..." [[2838 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
    "He was a very capable person. Someone as amazing as him shouldn't have ended his life in a remote town like Kempfa. But since it has already happened, it's not good for me, an outsider, to inquire too much." [[2839 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
    At this point, Isabella's voice suddenly paused, and she looked at Andre meaningfully. [[2840 旁白 neutral]]
    "But as the old priest's only heir, I feel the same aura from you as I did from him. The old priest must have passed on all his life's knowledge to you. Are you truly willing to stay in this unknown small town for the rest of your life with such extraordinary abilities?" [[2841 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella's voice was clear, and combined with her unique golden-brown eyes, many people would often slowly fall under her control and rhythm when listening to her words. [[2842 旁白 neutral]]
    However, it was undeniable that what she said was not sweet talk or sophistry, but a very obvious fact. [[2843 旁白 neutral]]
    "Why not? Going to a big city's cathedral doesn't necessarily mean a better life than in a small town. In a big city, I might get better material conditions, but here there are warm town residents, simple and kind children. The bread here is fragrant, and the water is clear. I feel very peaceful here." [[2844 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre did not retort with grand theories. He used the most simple language to describe the beauty of the small town. This undeniable fact was the hardest to shake. [[2845 旁白 neutral]]
    "Andre, I can really understand what you're saying. In this town, I also feel many beautiful things that are hard to give up. But do you know a saying?" [[2846 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "With great power comes great responsibility." [[2847 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella continued without waiting for Andre's answer. [[2848 旁白 neutral]]
    "The present beauty is certainly important, but in other distant lands, there are many towns or cities that were once as warm and beautiful as Kempfa, now suffering from the invasion of darkness and evil destruction..." [[2849 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
    "Ordinary people are powerless against these forces, and only we have the ability to stop them." [[2850 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Today, Isabella seemed to have opened up, saying many things she would never normally mention. [[2851 旁白 neutral]]
    Just what she was saying now didn't match her character at all. [[2852 旁白 neutral]]
    "Isabella, you value me greatly, and I thank you, but you must understand that no matter how omnipotent or important I may seem in your eyes, in the eyes of the priests or bishops of those great cathedrals, I am just an ordinary third-rank priest." [[2853 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Third-rank might be noticeable in Kempfa, but in a large city or great cathedral full of talented people, I am nothing special. Likewise, the Church will not entrust me with any important tasks." [[2854 安德烈 neutral]]
    Looking at the last light of the sky gradually being swallowed, the priest's face, intertwined with light and shadow, carried a sense of detachment that saw through the mundane world. [[2855 旁白 neutral]]
    "So you need an opportunity!" [[2856 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
    Isabella's tone lightened again, and the slyness that had just receded from her eyes surged forth once more, like a playful cat. [[2857 旁白 neutral]]
    "What do you want to say?" [[2858 安德烈 neutral]]
    "This is extremely important information, an exclusive offer, only here! It's very important for you. If you want to hear it, you'll have to pay a price. For example, can you quietly tell me what secret little George told you in the confessional?" [[2859 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
    Isabella thought of George confessing the truth, his face flushed, and his shy appearance, and she was intensely curious. [[2860 旁白 neutral]]
    What secret was this little devil hiding that made his face as red as a monkey's butt? [[2861 旁白 neutral]]
    "You tell me the information first, and then I'll decide whether to answer you." [[2862 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre said without principle, completely betraying little George's trust in him. [[2863 旁白 neutral]]
    "Okay, I believe you. Lean closer." [[2864 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella beckoned, but Andre remained motionless, hands still in his pockets. The grey-haired nun was so angry she bared her teeth, like a cat whose fur had bristled. [[2865 旁白 angry]]
    In the end, she couldn't outmaneuver the iron-willed Andre. She had to obediently lean close to his ear and whisper a few words. [[2866 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre nodded after listening. [[2867 旁白 neutral]]
    It was indeed quite important information. In two weeks, the Wind Saintess of the Windemere family would inspect her territory and might pass through Kempfa town? [[2868 旁白 neutral]]
    "How is it? How is it? Is this news important? I heard that the current Wind Saintess greatly values talent. If you seize this opportunity, you can rely on the Saintess as a big supporter~" [[2869 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
    Andre just kept nodding, not answering. [[2870 旁白 neutral]]
    Leaning on this "big tree" actually had no meaning for him, after all... ahem. However, this news did remind him that on the Sunday approaching the date, Evelyn had better avoid the Saintess's procession. [[2871 旁白 neutral]]
    "What about my reward?" [[2872 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Andre said nothing, just continued walking into the church, as if he hadn't heard the question. [[2873 旁白 neutral]]
    "If Father pretends not to hear, I'll have to raid you tonight~" [[2874 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
    Someone's body suddenly stiffened, his steps halted. After a long sigh, he pulled out a small crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and tossed it backward. [[2875 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella steadily caught the paper ball, her face full of excitement as she opened it. Eagerly, she looked, but instantly found herself laughing and crying at the same time. [[2876 旁白 surprised]]
    It turned out that the little fellow had accidentally peeked at Sister Mary bathing next door. This guy's face was red for a whole day! [[2877 旁白 surprised]]
    "That's it? What a kid who hasn't even grown all his hair yet~" [[2878 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
    After finishing this tiny bit of gossip, Isabella responsibly destroyed the note. After all, Andre had noted at the end of the paper that the privacy of believers must be protected. [[2879 旁白 neutral]]
    If one more person knew this secret, the impact could still be controlled, but if it spread, little George would likely be ridiculed by his friends for a while. Although the child was still young, as Andre said... [[2880 旁白 neutral]]
    Even children need the same respect as adults. [[2881 旁白 neutral]]
