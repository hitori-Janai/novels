Chapter 57: Anomaly [[3234 旁白 neutral]]
The sky gradually darkened. The windmill on the high tower turned in the evening breeze. Following the smoke rising from the chimneys, people returned to their homes to prepare dinner. [[3235 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella stood at the door. After greeting a few young nuns, she returned to the church alone. [[3236 旁白 neutral]]
Today had been exhausting. Although she was mentally prepared for this every Sunday, she couldn't help but feel overwhelmed when she recalled the almost fanatical scene of the entire town's residents—Sister Evelyn's charm was simply off the charts. [[3237 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
A girl as beloved and angelic as her was truly someone ordinary people couldn't refuse. [[3238 伊莎贝ラ neutral]]
The door to the confessional was still open. Pushing it open, she saw the blue-haired nun still sitting at the desk. By the dim light, the girl's slender fingers gripped a quill, seriously writing something on paper. [[3239 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Evelyn, it's almost dinnertime. It's time to take a break. If you keep working so hard, big sister here will start to worry." [[3240 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella walked over, rested her fingers on the desk, and glanced at the information the girl was recording. [[3241 旁白 neutral]]
She had to admit, the girl's handwriting was elegant, with a grace like flowing water. What she was recording was just the health status and basic information of the believers who had come today—for example, the results of Grandpa Charles's leg injury follow-up and how many more treatments he might need to recover. [[3242 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the dense script on the paper, Isabella felt a pang, like a mother worrying about her hardworking daughter. She reached out and gently massaged Evelyn's shoulders, reminding her softly. [[3243 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Evelyn, you are just too gentle and too serious. No wonder everyone in town likes you. Even I can't resist you." [[3244 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
"Not only do you have a good personality, Sister Evelyn, but you also seem to have a special talent for healing magic. John's eldest son only broke his arm last week, and now it's already healed." [[3245 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Reading the information Evelyn had written, Isabella naturally attributed the patient's recovery to her. [[3246 旁白 neutral]]
"No, I didn't really do much. My healing spell only helped to set his bone and speed up the reconnection. Even with healing magic, it was expected to take about two weeks..." [[3247 伊芙琳 neutral]]
"Then that just means your healing magic has improved without you realizing it! Doesn't that just prove that Sister Evelyn is a magic genius?" [[3248 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
Isabella said with a laugh, playfully twirling a stray strand of the girl's blue hair that fell by her ear, her voice intimate. [[3249 旁白 neutral]]
"No, it really wasn't my doing." [[3250 伊芙琳 neutral]]
The girl continued to deny it, but Isabella just kept looking at her with a smile. [[3251 旁白 neutral]]
"Right, right, it wasn't your doing. John's eldest son is just built different, and his broken arm healed on its own in a week." [[3252 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Of course, she took Evelyn's denials as the girl's modesty and humility. But in reality, Evelyn never lied, and this time was no exception. [[3253 旁白 neutral]]
To hide her true abilities and avoid attracting too much attention, she always controlled her healing of the townspeople's illnesses and injuries to a normal level. The recovery of John's eldest son's broken bone was truly beyond her expectations. [[3254 伊芙琳 neutral]]
More importantly, according to the conversation in the confessional, the patient himself had said that he broke his arm last Sunday, which was when she was "online." After her simple bandaging and assisted healing, the broken arm had completely healed by this Wednesday. [[3255 伊芙琳 surprised]]
From a modern medical perspective, a broken arm needs at least two to three months of rest to recover. With healing magic, a standard healing spell could shorten this to about two weeks. But taking only three days was completely beyond the scope of a normal healing spell. [[3256 伊芙琳 neutral]]
Evelyn was certain that the healing of John's eldest son's arm was only partly due to her healing spell; the vast majority was due to his own powerful healing ability. [[3257 伊芙琳 neutral]]
This was not an isolated case. Uncle John himself had shown powerful self-healing, and similar incidents had occurred with other families in town. It was just that everyone attributed these events to her, when in fact... [[3258 伊芙琳 neutral]]
Evelyn didn't try to explain further. She knew that when people believe they already know the truth, any attempt to argue would be misinterpreted. [[3259 伊芙琳 neutral]]
So Kempf Town, where the old priest lived in seclusion, was not as ordinary as it seemed. It held some unknown secrets. [[3260 伊芙琳 neutral]]
"Alright, let's go prepare dinner." [[3261 伊芙琳 neutral]]
Evelyn put down her quill and closed the leather-bound diary. [[3262 旁白 neutral]]
"Yay! I get to taste Sister Evelyn's cooking again tonight!" [[3263 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
Isabella looked as if she had been waiting for this moment. The last bit of her composure as a senior nun crumbled, and her golden-brown eyes were filled with anticipation for dinner. [[3264 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't that she, the senior nun, was too lazy to even make dinner, forcing her younger Sister Evelyn to do it. It was just that she had tasted Evelyn's cooking once, and the flavor... it was as unforgettable as a divine nectar. [[3265 旁白 neutral]]
... [[3266 旁白 neutral]]
... [[3267 旁白 neutral]]
"So, does Sister Evelyn really not want to let her big sister visit her home?" [[3268 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
After dinner, Isabella's true nature was completely exposed. She clung to Evelyn like an octopus, muttering cute complaints that no one else ever heard. [[3269 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister Isabella, you promised me you wouldn't ask about my home. Are you going back on your word?" [[3270 伊芙琳 neutral]]
The girl's watery eyes, as clear and blue as the sea, made it impossible for anyone to say no to her. [[3271 旁白 neutral]]
"I... ugh, alright. If you don't want me to, Sister Evelyn, I won't ask anymore." [[3272 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
The gray-haired nun slumped onto the table in frustration, her face full of disappointment. [[3273 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, don't be sad. We'll see each other again next Sunday. I'm going to take the dishes to be washed." [[3274 伊芙琳 neutral]]
The girl cleared the dishes from the table and headed toward the back of the church. [[3275 旁白 neutral]]
But she was gone for a long time. When Isabella realized this and rushed to the kitchen, she found a stack of clean dishes on the cupboard and some water stains on the table, but Evelyn was nowhere to be seen. [[3276 旁白 neutral]]
The gray-haired nun stomped her foot in frustration. [[3277 旁白 angry]]
"Sigh, that little girl ran off again..." [[3278 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
"Honestly, why is everyone so unwilling to leave this place? It's just a normal little town. What's so attractive about it?" [[3279 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"There's less than two weeks left, and I can't manage to lure away either of the two people I wanted to. Is my personality really that bad?" [[3280 伊莎贝ラ sad]]
As she spoke, Isabella began to lose confidence, pinching her own soft cheeks with a puzzled expression. [[3281 旁白 neutral]]
At that moment, in an unknown corner outside the town, a blue light gradually dimmed. Stepping out of the light was Father Andre, dressed in his vestments, who had been missing for a day. [[3282 旁白 neutral]]
Andre stretched his sore neck, habitually rolled up his sleeves to look at his arm, and frowned again. [[3283 旁白 neutral]]
Who could explain this to him? [[3284 安德烈 fearful]]
He was a seven-foot-tall man, so why was his skin as delicate as Isabella's? And with each transformation, it seemed to be getting even better than hers. [[3285 安德烈 fearful]]
This pale complexion was too much. He couldn't get a tan no matter how much sun he got. Although he had plenty of muscle, strong muscles without a tan just seemed to be lacking something. [[3286 安德烈 neutral]]
"Damn it, this Saintess bloodline can't be this strong, can it?" [[3287 安德烈 fearful]]
A bad feeling crept into Andre's mind. He remembered something the old man had said before he died. [[3288 旁白 neutral]]
A sense of helplessness washed over him. In the end, he could only curse under his breath and walk towards the church. [[3289 旁白 neutral]]
