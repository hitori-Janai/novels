Chapter 126: Judgment [[7478 旁白 neutral]]
    The pure blue-haired Saintess pressed her hands together over her chest. A holy light flowed from between her fingertips, then transformed into three streaks of light, which injected into the three water mirrors of different colors— [[7479 旁白 neutral]]
    Pink light revealed a demonic shadow. A playful, heart-shaped black tail danced happily behind it, and seductive leather clothing shimmered with a sexy sheen. With its pale hair spread out, its opened pink, heart-shaped eyes were filled with countless desires. [[7480 旁白 neutral]]
    Within the red light, blood glowed. Noble silver hair bathed in bright moonlight, with subtle cherry-pink accents at the ends of the strands. A gothic dress was classic and elegant, and the Bloodline girl's scarlet eyes held innate arrogance. [[7481 旁白 neutral]]
    The golden light was as fiery as the sun, and a muscular figure appeared from within. His short golden hair was sharp and clean, but his azure eyes were as romantic as a poet's. A white ceremonial robe draped over his body, outlining the man's bulging muscles. His gaze was faint, but deep within, it hid a heavy sense of guilt. [[7482 旁白 neutral]]
    Finally, there was blue. The ever-changing water mirror reflected her countless forms, but only four were truly lit up. Within the rippling, divine water realm, another point of vibrant green and deep blue was "budding," full of rich life. [[7483 旁白 neutral]]
    Trapped in the Immaculate Prison, Celeste witnessed the entire process. The authority of wisdom allowed her to see through all illusions in the world, yet the young girl's clean emerald eyes still widened sharply in that instant. The truth was right before her, but at that moment, she even wondered if her abilities had made a mistake? [[7484 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
    Can anyone truly encompass so many bloodlines by themselves? [[7485 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
    Not to mention, the purity of each of these bloodlines is extremely high. Even if they were all mixed branch bloodlines, that would still be a blend of divine blood and demonic blood. Can anyone in this world truly fuse Saintess blood and Demon Clan blood and still live well? [[7486 塞莱斯特 fearful]]
    If they don't self-destruct, an early death would be a miracle. Furthermore, at a time like this, they can clearly separate the power of each bloodline one by one, fighting individually. [[7487 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Is this really still a mortal? [[7488 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
    Even gods shouldn't act so recklessly, right? [[7489 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
    Thousands of thoughts swirled in her mind, but she still understood that the most important thing right now was to deal with a sixth-order Duke who had completely gone mad. All other problems had to make way before this one. [[7490 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Thinking this, she flapped her wings and entered the center of the four-person encirclement. As for Medea, although she was also surprised, her closer associate, Lobelia, had already told her many secrets beforehand. So, the red-haired witch didn't hesitate much and immediately joined the team to defeat the Bloodline Duke. [[7491 旁白 neutral]]
    Thus, the encirclement of six people was completely formed, with each person standing at one of six points, subtly forming a formation. [[7492 旁白 neutral]]
    The blood-stained water, imprisoned by the [Immaculate Prison], surged. Amidst the tremendous noise of the blood waves crashing, Vlad's roar could even be faintly heard. How could this frantic sixth-order Duke just surrender? [[7493 旁白 angry]]
    He still had power he hadn't unleashed, and he still had grudges unavenged. If the blood river couldn't fully spread out, his undying legion couldn't be fully summoned, and even his own immortality was greatly weakened. [[7494 旁白 neutral]]
    The blood from the blood river was concentrated at one point, which gave everyone a chance to seal him. Originally, if even a small portion of these hundreds of millions of drops of blood escaped, everyone wouldn't be able to truly kill or seal him. But now, every drop of blood was equally confined within this water prison. The previously arrogant Bloodline Duke was now a trapped beast in the eyes of his prey. [[7495 旁白 sad]]
    At this point, his remaining sanity completely evaporated. Vlad's will, contained in every drop of blood in the blood river, executed destructive acts with near madness. [[7496 旁白 angry]]
    The Emerald Holy Sword hummed in Celeste's hand. The pure blue-haired Saintess stood at the core of the formation, closing her eyes in prayer, doing her best to maintain the balance of power. Invisible wind chains were the first to entwine around the surging pillar of blood. [[7497 旁白 neutral]]
    Almost simultaneously, three forces from the water mirrors burst forth: [[7498 旁白 neutral]]
    The pink phantom's heart-shaped tail swayed gracefully, and seductive sounds transformed into tangible pink ripples, layer upon layer, impacting the blood river, attempting to dismantle its violent will; the silver-haired Bloodline girl's fingertips guided the cold moonlight, which, like an icy carving knife, fiercely cut and froze the restless, foul blood; the golden-haired priest roared, his arms bulging with muscles, and scorching holy light, like the fire of a furnace, burned every drop of resisting blood with the will of purification and judgment! [[7499 旁白 neutral]]
    Medea's red hair danced wildly amidst the surging magic, and ancient incantations transformed into crimson rune chains, working with Lobelia's moonlight carving knife, firmly binding the core of the blood river. [[7500 旁白 neutral]]
    "Roar—!!!" [[7501 弗拉德 angry]]
    The blood waves within the prison no longer merely crashed, but completely exploded! Hundreds of millions of drops of foul blood, under extreme pressure and purification, let out a soul-twisting shriek that surpassed the limits of sound! [[7502 旁白 fearful]]
    The blood was no longer liquid; it wildly condensed and stretched, transforming into countless twisted, pained faces of Vlad in the confined space, or condensing into giant mouths full of fangs and sharp bone claws, desperately tearing and crashing against the Immaculate Prison's barrier! [[7503 旁白 angry]]
    Every drop of blood burned its essence, releasing Vlad's almost infinite hatred and madness. In that surging crimson, the will of destruction solidified, aiming to drag this prison, along with everyone outside, into the eternal, foul blood purgatory! [[7504 旁白 angry]]
    The barrier vibrated violently, and tiny cracks began to spread. The powers of the six strong individuals clashed violently with this desperate torrent of destruction! [[7505 旁白 neutral]]
    The struggle of powers melted matter, and above the rippling blood river, it was like a sauna, with blood mist rising. At this moment, Vlad couldn't care less. He used all his available power. In the small space of the water prison, thousands of undead creatures suddenly spewed out from the blood river like a geyser. [[7506 旁白 neutral]]
    Judging by this posture, he intended to physically burst the super-level magic through material compression. [[7507 旁白 neutral]]
    And such a mad and brainless act was, of course, quickly seen through by Celeste. Endless wails of the undead echoed in her ears, like the most polluted spiritual contamination in this world. [[7508 旁白 neutral]]
    But Celeste wasn't agitated by this spiritual noise; instead, a moment of pity showed in her eyes. Then, holy light flowed in her emerald eyes, and the Holy Sword she held high suddenly hummed more intensely! [[7509 旁白 neutral]]
    Pure, flawless cyan light poured out from the sword, transforming into hundreds of millions of gentle dawn breezes, softly yet irresistibly penetrating the blood mist and prison barrier, brushing against every wailing undead. [[7510 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    "Wind as a guide, spirits as wings—return to the other shore." [[7511 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Her clear voice carried the power to soothe all things. The moment the incantation sounded, the foul wails ceased abruptly. [[7512 旁白 neutral]]
    The grotesque forms of the undead melted like ice and snow in the cyan glow. Their imprisoned, twisted souls were gently lifted by this pure wind, shedding their crimson and malice, transforming into specks of pure white soul fire, and ascending and dissipating with bell-like, clear afterimages, returning to eternal tranquility—this was the most benevolent freedom bestowed by the Wind Saintess. [[7513 旁白 neutral]]
    Just like that, the souls that Beifurad had privately imprisoned and enslaved for thousands of years were all liberated at this moment. The free wind blew upon their almost transparent spiritual bodies, carrying them towards the distant path of soul return. [[7514 旁白 neutral]]
    The wails of the undead gradually decreased, but Vlad's wails became increasingly exaggerated. The Wind Saintess earning merit by cleansing the undead. The more she cleansed, the more dazzling the emerald light on her became. But those undead she was cleansing were *his* power! [[7515 旁白 angry]]
    The reason Vlad had been able to firmly hold his position as a sixth-order Duke for so many years was inextricably linked to his innate ability. He could continuously increase his strength by endlessly devouring external life forms. As long as they had blood, he could devour and enslave both their bodies and souls. [[7516 旁白 neutral]]
    Every creature he devoured increased his strength by a fraction. Similarly, now, every undead cleansed by the Wind Saintess irreversibly weakened his strength by a fraction. There was no life for him to devour in the imprisoned water prison, so he could only watch himself slowly weaken. [[7517 旁白 sad]]
    "No!! No!!!" [[7518 弗拉德 angry]]
    His shouts, filled with both anger and terror, were mixed in the rolling blood waves. At this moment, he had completely lost his previous elegance and composure. His collapsing body and instincts overpowering his reason made him look more like an ugly ghoul nearing its end. [[7519 旁白 sad]]
    Once he released a large number of souls, his already incomplete soul could not suppress this tide. So, the undead, sensing freedom, rushed out of the blood river, vying for this one chance of liberation in thousands of years. And Celeste did not disappoint them; freedom equally passed through their translucent soul bodies, bringing them hope. [[7520 旁白 neutral]]
    Medea, who was assisting with control from the side, was surprised to find that the depth of the blood river was decreasing at a visible rate. The river water was disappearing rapidly, as if it were evaporating quickly under the scorching sun! [[7521 旁白 surprised]]
    At the same time, she also felt that her deep-set arrangement, the love within the blood water, began to tremble abnormally. [[7522 旁白 surprised]]
    It was Vlad, Vlad could no longer hold back and was preparing for a final, desperate counterattack! [[7523 旁白 neutral]]
    The witch's intuition instantly sparked this thought in Medea's mind. She was about to use magic to amplify her voice and warn her companions when she saw seven colossal azure chains, thicker than herself, pass behind her and pierce into the blood river. [[7524 旁白 neutral]]
    [Water Element • Super-Level • Hub of the Seven Seas] [[7525 旁白 neutral]]
    "Got you." [[7526 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
    Lobelia's faint voice, at this moment, even showed a hint of pleasure. [[7527 旁白 neutral]]
    She stood at the center, assuming a praying posture, not only to maintain the balance of the [Immaculate Prison], but also for this opportune moment. [[7528 旁白 neutral]]
    Realizing he couldn't escape and was increasingly at a disadvantage, Vlad would inevitably choose to break through at all costs at a critical juncture. During this process, if the obstruction was too deep, it would be difficult to ensure safe retreat from a bloodthirsty sixth-order Bloodline. [[7529 旁白 neutral]]
    Therefore… [[7530 旁白 neutral]]
    So, the best way was to firmly pin him down the moment he showed himself, giving him no chance to make a ripple. [[7531 旁白 neutral]]
    Celeste, who had just finished cleansing the undead and gained some insight, couldn't help but swallow after witnessing this scene. [[7532 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
    So strong! [[7533 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
    From her perspective, the Water Saintess had just drawn upon the vast essence of the Water of Life, summoning immense power from the world's source sea. [[7534 旁白 neutral]]
    Suddenly, several deep vortices, swirling with pure azure light, tore open in the void. From them, seven liquid chains, thicker than ancient tree trunks, shot out! [[7535 旁白 neutral]]
    As a fellow Saintess, Celeste could clearly perceive that these chains were not physical metal, but rather formed from "Source Water" that was extremely compressed and imbued with the laws of life and purification. Their surfaces flowed with brilliant azure runes like a galaxy, emitting a heavy pressure that suppressed all things and a chilling coldness that froze souls. [[7536 旁白 neutral]]
    It seemed to contain a portion of the power derived from ice elements. [[7537 旁白 neutral]]
    As soon as the chains appeared, they disregarded spatial distance and accurately pierced through the target area. Like living deep-sea pythons, they coiled and squeezed the target with irresistible force. Each chain carried the immense weight of a thousand abysses, firmly imprisoning the enemy. [[7538 旁白 neutral]]
    As the seven chains pulled, the flowing blood river was instantly absorbed as if by a black hole, and Vlad, tightly clamped by the chains, revealed his disheveled true form. [[7539 旁白 neutral]]
    Looking at the disheveled Bloodline Duke, a thought became even firmer in Celeste's mind— [[7540 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Indeed, Mother was right. The gentler a person appears on the surface, the more unfathomable they are within. The supremely gentle and kind Water Saintess, your existence is truly as bottomless as the boundless ocean. [[7541 塞莱斯特 happy]]
    "Everyone, the time of judgment has come. Do not spare your strength. Give it your all. The Demon Clan must pay the price for their conspiracy." [[7542 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The young girl's voice was still gentle, but it echoed with extraordinary force. [[7543 旁白 neutral]]
    The six individuals who had taken their positions finally stopped concealing anything. Medea opened the pure white coffin. Among the dozens of weapons vertically inserted within, a pair of weapons seemed to receive a summons, trembling as they flew out and were steadily caught by Andre. [[7544 旁白 neutral]]
    The sword blade was clear, and cold light flowed. The man gently stroked the blade, lowering his eyes and murmuring. [[7545 旁白 neutral]]
    "Old man, at this point, you also want to witness this historic moment, right... Then come on, today, I will use the weapon forged from your body to drink the Duke's blood!" [[7546 安德烈 angry]]
    Buzz! [[7547 旁白 neutral]]
    As if in response to the man, the pair of gun-swords trembled more violently. Nameless blue flames ignited on the blades, even spreading directly onto Andre's body. The flames blazed, yet seemed to possess a will of their own, clinging to the man's body and manifesting as a translucent, dark blue wolf king phantom. [[7548 旁白 neutral]]
    "Howl—!" [[7549 狼王 angry]]
    The lone wolf king howled, blowing the horn for the final battle. [[7550 旁白 neutral]]
    Hearing the howl of his mortal enemy, the already disheveled Vlad, like a startled bird, looked up at the sky. This gaze almost scared him to death, filling him with despair— [[7551 旁白 fearful]]
    A pink-eyed succubus, a red-haired witch, a silver-haired Bloodline, a white-robed priest, a green-eyed "Ink Thrush," an azure Saintess… [[7552 旁白 fearful]]
    Six people in total, and not one of them didn't restrain him! [[7553 旁白 fearful]]
    Leaving aside the two Saintesses, divine blood and demonic blood were inherently incompatible. The priest with the soul of the wolf king and the red-haired witch were natural mortal enemies of the Bloodline. The only one of his own kind who didn't possess innate restraining attributes was also a freak who could use wolf king bone weapons. [[7554 旁白 fearful]]
    Now, when he saw the six people, it was as if he saw six stars of doom lighting up in the sky. [[7555 旁白 fearful]]
    "I haven't lost yet!" [[7556 弗拉德 angry]]
    He roared loudly, but no one paid attention. [[7557 旁白 neutral]]
    The formation eyes ignited in sequence beneath the feet of the six individuals. The formation eyes connected to each other in turn, surrounding Vlad in the center, forming the most luxurious version of a hexagram array. [[7558 旁白 neutral]]
