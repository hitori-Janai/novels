Chapter 72: Suppressing Firepower [[4086 旁白 neutral]]
As a foul smell filled the air, scarlet pierced through the night. [[4087 旁白 neutral]]
The white-robed priest, standing on the mound, saw all of this. Without the sun's suppression, these monsters, born from the darkness, charged towards the town like hungry wolves pouring out of their nests. [[4088 旁白 neutral]]
On the road ahead, the scent of living humans made them uncontrollably drool, their pale teeth unconsciously grinding. Instinct drove them to seek fresh flesh and blood. [[4089 旁白 neutral]]
Above the night sky, dozens of strange bats circled and shrieked in groups. Without a doubt, as the first living humans to appear, they had marked Andre as their first prey. [[4090 旁白 neutral]]
The distance between the two sides rapidly closed. Andre calmly watched the surging monster attack while gathering magic in his palm. [[4091 旁白 neutral]]
This scene was so much like the bloody battle Serenia faced alone four years ago, one person against hundreds of thousands of enemies. This sense of oppression was an extreme test for both spirit and soul. [[4092 旁白 neutral]]
But today was different. This time, he would no longer shrink back, not only because he had the power to resist, but more importantly, he increasingly understood Serenia's state of mind at that time—he had something he must protect behind him. [[4093 旁白 neutral]]
In this battle, no matter the outcome, he could not retreat! [[4094 旁白 neutral]]
I am the last line of defense! [[4095 旁白 neutral]]
When the distance between them was less than a hundred meters, the priest on the mound leaped up. With a furious roar, the Holy Light Technique in his hand instantly bloomed. [[4096 旁白 neutral]]
[Basic • Super • Holy Light Technique] [[4097 旁白 neutral]]
As a Discipline Priest who inherited the old man's exquisite close-combat abilities, Andre didn't need to worry too much about the distribution and use of magic like a magician. Magic was only an aid to his combat power; killing enemies still depended on the gun and sword in his hand! [[4098 旁白 neutral]]
A magnified version of the Holy Light Technique was released in the night sky. Instantly, the night sky was like a miniature sun igniting, and the holy white light, like thousands of golden threads, pierced through the monsters' eyes hidden in the darkness. [[4099 旁白 neutral]]
Corrupted flesh touched the Holy Light, and the sizzling sound of scorching, accompanied by patches of white smoke, instantly halted the ghouls' charging formation. The piercing light made them unable to open their eyes, and the brilliance erupting in the sky made them instinctively retreat. [[4100 旁白 neutral]]
This was exactly what Andre wanted. He drew his twin silver pistols from the sides of his coat. Under the moonlight, the artistic gun bodies flowed with cold patterns. [[4101 旁白 neutral]]
The priest in mid-air pulled the trigger, and then, the gunshots rang out! [[4102 旁白 neutral]]
The dense firing sound almost instantly emptied the 12 demon-hunting bullets from both gun barrels. Facing a dense group, precise shooting no longer had much meaning. [[4103 旁白 neutral]]
The 12 bullets were directly emptied, indirectly triggering the "Twelve Consecutive Purifications" skill effect inherent in the Silver Killer. Demon-hunting bullets soaked in holy water were already fatally destructive to low-level dark creatures like ghouls. Now, triggering the skill also stacked penetration; a single bullet, with good luck, could often directly take down three ghouls with close limbs. [[4104 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Andre did not immediately discard the empty twin pistols. As he shook his hands, the cylinders automatically ejected outwards, and the hot casings clattered with a crisp metallic sound. [[4105 旁白 neutral]]
The man's lips moved, and with a few imperceptible incantations, air currents swirled around him. The flowing wind, like an invisible pair of large hands, carried silver bullets from his bulging pockets, precisely blowing them one by one into the empty cylinder holes. [[4106 旁白 neutral]]
The cylinders returned to place, less than three seconds after the previous round of shooting, and the metal muzzles once again spat out holy white gun flames! [[4107 旁白 neutral]]
Andre alone managed to create the feeling of an entire pistol company. The continuous firing produced a not-so-dense barrage. In an instant, flesh and blood splattered throughout the ghoul crowd, and severed limbs fell everywhere. [[4108 旁白 neutral]]
Although monsters lack reason, they can still feel pain. The white-robed human in front of them made them instinctively fearful. The two strangely shaped weapons he held seemed to spew divine punishment-like heavenly fire. [[4109 旁白 neutral]]
At the moment of engagement, Andre gained the upper hand with his weapon advantage and advanced magical understanding of automatic reloading. In contrast, the numerically superior ghoul pack became live targets for him to slaughter. [[4110 旁白 neutral]]
Brainless monsters do not know how to adapt; they only know how to charge blindly. The trigger kept being pulled, and the gunshots did not stop. The bodies of the dead ghouls in the front row even piled up a small sloped buffer zone. [[4111 旁白 neutral]]
The advantage was slowly expanding. Andre had enough demon-hunting bullets in his pocket, so brainless ghouls couldn't get a step closer to the town. [[4112 旁白 neutral]]
But the battlefield is always changing. Unlike the previous vanguard, which only had three vampires leading a small group of ghouls, this time, a whole squad of vampires was leading a large group of ghouls. [[4113 旁白 neutral]]
The strange bat swarm circling in the sky quickly detected that the "prey" on the ground was not simple. As they circled, a strange ultrasound was released, and a mental pollution-like sound wave attack interrupted Andre's magic incantation, instantly terminating the [Automatic Reload] magic. [[4114 旁白 neutral]]
The swirling air currents dispersed, and the bullets that were no longer supported by the wind fell to the ground, making crisp, clattering metallic sounds. [[4115 旁白 neutral]]
Facing the sudden mental attack, Andre, completely unprepared, showed a pained expression. One hand subconsciously held his temple, but his half-opened eyes, at this extremely difficult moment, glimpsed the rapidly approaching scarlet fierce light! [[4116 旁白 fearful]]
The sound wave suppression from the bat swarm in the sky continued, but the ghouls were unaffected. Having lost their suppressing fire, they rapidly closed the distance. The one closest to Andre was less than ten meters away! [[4117 旁白 neutral]]
At such a close distance, Andre could even clearly smell the strong stench coming from it. The ghouls' fangs and sharp claws could easily tear through an adult male's muscles and crush bones. [[4118 旁白 neutral]]
In a sense, as long as they were touched, these irrational monsters would start an unstoppable bloody massacre. [[4119 旁白 fearful]]
Just at this critical moment, the white-robed priest gritted his teeth hard, and a faint golden ripple instantly appeared in his emerald eyes. In the void, a golden net of discipline chains seemed to have been pulled up. [[4120 旁白 neutral]]
[Class Skill • Divine Art • Discipline] [[4121 旁白 neutral]]
"Uh!..." [[4122 陌生男1 neutral]]
A muffled groan from an unfamiliar male. The safe bat swarm suddenly stiffened collectively, and the overwhelming sound wave suppression came to an abrupt halt. [[4123 旁白 neutral]]
Without the influence of the sound waves, Andre, no longer stiff, lifted his leg and leaned forward, delivering a powerful spinning kick to the ghoul's abdomen as it rushed towards him. [[4124 旁白 neutral]]
Strong muscles instantly unleashed immense power. Under the blessing of his proud B+ level strength attribute, the ghoul kicked in mid-air flew out like a cannonball. [[4125 旁白 neutral]]
Without a moment's hesitation, Andre bent down, and two round-bellied glass bottles filled with silver liquid fell into his palms. He threw them up, and they were accurately thrown along an arc in front of the leading ghouls. [[4126 旁白 neutral]]
The glass shattered upon impact with the ground, and as the liquid splattered, gunshots followed as expected. The sparks from the bullets ignited the mysterious silver liquid. In an instant, a wall of silver sacred flame ignited in front of the ghoul swarm. [[4127 旁白 neutral]]
Using the wall of fire created by the Holy White Flame to delay the ghouls' advance, Andre dared not waste a moment. He reached into his pocket, but what he pulled out was not individual bullets, but a whole handful of silver magic talismans. [[4128 旁白 neutral]]
Since suppressing fire wasn't enough, he was going to stack buffs! [[4129 旁白 neutral]]
