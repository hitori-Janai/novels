Chapter 21: Reset 21 - Divine Art [[1256 旁白 neutral]]
Serenia didn't know why the young man before her had become like this, just as she hadn't known back then why that gentle older brother figure had turned into someone everyone despised. [[1257 旁白 sad]]
The disheveled young man reached out to her, just like the first time they met, when he stood in the sunlight and extended a hand to her, who was huddled in a corner. [[1258 旁白 neutral]]
They should have been inseparable childhood friends, a tight bond connecting the two great Saintess families. But all of that, along with their childhood and their growing distance, was now just a memory of the past. [[1259 旁白 sad]]
Now, the unacknowledged girl had become a revered Saintess, while the noble-born boy had fallen into a despised profligate. [[1260 旁白 neutral]]
Time and fate seemed to have played a joke on them, swapping their roles and severing the sincere friendship they had built as children. [[1261 旁白 sad]]
But now, it seemed... [[1262 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"There's no need." [[1263 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Serenia lowered her head, rejecting his kind gesture. [[1264 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An retracted his hand, showing no embarrassment at the rejection. As a villainous side character, he had to be self-aware. Isn't it perfectly normal to be rejected by the game's main heroine? [[1265 塞伦安 neutral]]
As a modern man who considered himself clear-headed, he had always thought his greatest strength was self-awareness. [[1266 塞伦安 neutral]]
Even if he avoided the bad ending of the original plot and returned to the main storyline, a chosen one like Serenia was not someone he could desire. [[1267 塞伦安 neutral]]
Besides, now was not the time to worry about romance. His life was on the line. The bold decision he just made felt like an unconscious action from his body... [[1268 塞伦安 fearful]]
As expected, even though that mysterious voice was gone, its influence on this body and on himself continued. [[1269 塞伦安 fearful]]
But what was the point of all this? [[1270 塞伦安 sad]]
Making him unconsciously grow close to Serenia, even develop feelings for her... their game identities made their positions naturally opposed. A holy Saintess would never associate with a worthless, profligate scion. Likewise, the chances of a villainous side character being redeemed in this kind of game were close to zero. [[1271 塞伦安 sad]]
What's more, in a situation where everyone's life was in danger, even if they miraculously developed feelings for each other and he cleared his name, the huge gap in their combat power wouldn't change. [[1272 塞伦安 fearful]]
Come on, this wasn't some magical girl anime where combat strength is based on willpower. Shouting about bonds and friendship while charging into the demon army would only get you instantly crushed. [[1273 塞伦安 neutral]]
The wooden hut creaked and swayed unsettlingly. The faltering barrier outside was about to break under the demons' charge. Anna's mother, having just given birth, was severely weakened and had only just been saved from death by Selen An's blood transfusion. Serenia had retreated back into the hut, her aura clearly much weaker. The only one in the room in relatively good condition was Anna. [[1274 旁白 fearful]]
The silence inside the hut was terrifying. The only sounds that could be heard were the creaking of the wood and the gasps for breath. [[1275 旁白 fearful]]
"Anna..." [[1276 安娜母亲 sad]]
The woman on the bed had woken up at some point and called out weakly. [[1277 旁白 neutral]]
Anna rushed to the bedside, her eyes filled with heartache and sorrow as she looked at her mother, who was struggling even to open her eyes. [[1278 旁白 sad]]
The woman was withered and thin, her rough, branch-like hand gently caressed the girl's face. She then looked down at the swaddled baby, and a spark of determination lit up her gentle eyes. [[1279 旁白 sad]]
"Your Holiness, the Saintess..." [[1280 安娜母亲 neutral]]
She mustered her remaining strength to turn and look at the silver-haired girl guarding the door. [[1281 旁白 neutral]]
"Madam, I am here." [[1282 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Serenia also came to the bedside and knelt down. [[1283 旁白 neutral]]
"Your Holiness, I know of your kindness and I believe in your faith, but this time, I beg you to listen to the words of an ignorant woman. Think of it as a mother's humblest request..." [[1284 安娜母亲 sad]]
... [[1285 旁白 neutral]]
... [[1286 旁白 neutral]]
The fierce storm was like a thousand steel blades chopping at the ice-blue, hemispherical barrier, creating dense, overlapping ripples. Fireballs engulfed in steam exploded against it, adding yet another crack to the already fractured shield. [[1287 旁白 fearful]]
Amidst the black tide of the army, a tower-like figure on a tall demonic steed watched the small "fortress" swaying in the wind and rain. Encased in black heavy armor, only a pair of crimson eyes, like burning hellfire, were exposed, exceptionally conspicuous in the night. [[1288 旁白 fearful]]
"General Kegesa..." [[1289 玛拉 fearful]]
Before him, on a patch of ground intentionally left empty by the demon soldiers, a succubus in a revealing leather skirt was prostrated on the ground, trembling. Compared to the heavily armored general on his tall steed, the succubus, who usually slaughtered commoners like chickens, was now a shivering ant. [[1290 旁白 fearful]]
"Useless." [[1291 克格萨 angry]]
In the downpour, the demon general's voice, though hoarse, boomed like thunder in the succubus's ear, making the already trembling purple-skinned succubus shake like a leaf. [[1292 旁白 fearful]]
"Give me another chance, General Kegesa, just one more chance!" [[1293 玛拉 fearful]]
Mara resisted the mountain-like pressure and with great difficulty, raised her head to beg. [[1294 旁白 fearful]]
"This time, this time, I will definitely not let that bastard go! I won't give him another chance. I will make him fall into the most despised form in humanity through pain and humiliation!" [[1295 玛拉 angry]]
Mara's voice was filled with deep resentment and venom. [[1296 旁白 angry]]
If Serenia hadn't arrived in time, she would have almost succeeded. If she had, she wouldn't be kneeling so humiliatingly before General Kegesa now, but sitting in a high position, toying with the tip of her foot on a succubus Selen An who wished he was dead. [[1297 玛拉 angry]]
Just a little bit more! [[1298 玛拉 angry]]
And now I'm being scolded by General Kegesa! It's all those two bastards' fault! [[1299 玛拉 angry]]
Her sharp, resentful nails dug so hard into her palms that purple demon blood mixed with the muddy water. [[1300 旁白 angry]]
"Do you think your lowly existence is worth another chance from me?" [[1301 克格萨 angry]]
Kegesa looked down at the succubus on the ground, his burning eyes seeming to want to incinerate the entire world. [[1302 旁白 fearful]]
The cold words made Mara feel as if all the blood in her body had frozen. This time, she didn't even dare to tremble. The stench of death approached. Just as Mara thought she would die here, the terrifying pressure vanished. [[1303 旁白 fearful]]
"For now, I'll consider your worthless body to still have some value. Remember what you just said, bring back that kid from the Winterlein family..." [[1304 克格萨 neutral]]
"Remember, I want him alive. I want to personally taste a descendant with divine blood flowing in their veins!" [[1305 克格萨 angry]]
"Yes!" [[1306 玛拉 fearful]]
As if she had just survived a disaster, Mara kowtowed forcefully, her forehead hitting the ground hard enough to leave a deep imprint. [[1307 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, she converted this humiliation into a more turbulent rage against Selen An. The once kind nun had fallen into a demon of all evil. The kindness of humanity had vanished, leaving only the dregs of evil. [[1308 旁白 angry]]
She swore to make Selen An pay the ultimate price, to return the humiliation she had suffered twofold, so that he would never be able to recover! [[1309 旁白 angry]]
She spread her fleshy wings and flew to the front of the formation. [[1310 旁白 neutral]]
Just then, the ice-blue barrier that had been holding back the demon army finally gave way and shattered completely! [[1311 旁白 fearful]]
And at the same time, the door of the wooden hut opened. An ice-blue magic halo burst forth with a dazzling light that illuminated the darkness. The brilliance of the divine age tore through the clamor of wind and rain. Pale frost roared like a howling azure dragon, bringing a judgment of ice and cold! [[1312 旁白 surprised]]
