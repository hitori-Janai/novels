Chapter 132: Conferment [[8159 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, no, I should call you Young Master now, that would be more appropriate." [[8160 旁白 neutral]]
Seraphina had been struggling internally for an unknown amount of time. Selen An had just finished his bowl of vegetable soup when her voice finally sounded. [[8161 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An looked up, habitually about to wipe the soup stains from his mouth, but the girl stopped him with her hand, handing him a clean silk handkerchief instead. [[8162 旁白 neutral]]
The young man took the handkerchief, wiped his mouth, and looked at the golden-haired girl with renewed interest. [[8163 旁白 neutral]]
"How about it? Now that you know my true identity, has your reverence for me changed a little?" [[8164 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Young Master, before you answer this question, please allow me to ask you a question." [[8165 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Ask away." [[8166 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man spread his hands, an indifferent expression on his face. He had already voluntarily exposed his identity, so why would he be afraid of others asking more questions? [[8167 旁白 neutral]]
"Before this, were the evil deeds I heard about you true?" [[8168 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Seraphina's eyes solidified at this moment, as if waiting for a crucial answer. [[8169 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm, almost all the absurd things you heard about my evil deeds, except for a very few fabrications, I have done." [[8170 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An nodded while wiping his mouth with the silk handkerchief. At the same time, his attention was focused on the subtle changes in the girl's facial expression. He was curious: what kind of expression would Seraphina show at the moment of witnessing a flawless person personally admit their true intentions, and experiencing the collapse of her idol? [[8171 旁白 neutral]]
Was it disappointment? Disgust? Or sadness? [[8172 旁白 neutral]]
Various guesses flashed through his mind, but reality did not adopt any of them. After getting the answer, the girl simply lowered her head in thought. Not long after, she looked up again, and the sincerity in her disguised dark eyes was even greater than before. [[8173 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An was a little surprised by this outcome. [[8174 旁白 surprised]]
"I didn't see much emotional change on your face?" [[8175 塞伦安 surprised]]
"What kind of expression would Young Master like to see on my face? Is it anger after learning the truth, or disappointment and sadness after a certain belief is shattered?" [[8176 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Her extremely calm tone made Selen An even more shocked. [[8177 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh, you are indeed different from others." [[8178 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Everyone is an absolutely independent and different individual. I cannot confirm what kind of expression others would show after hearing this answer, but what I want to say is, no matter how detestable you were in the past, as long as you still hold noble ideals now, then..." [[8179 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The girl placed her left hand on her chest, knelt on one knee, closed her eyes, her expression pious and sincere. [[8180 旁白 neutral]]
"You are the guiding lighthouse I am willing to follow." [[8181 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Selen An stood in place, looking down at the girl half-kneeling on the blanket, showing him loyalty, his eyes complex. [[8182 旁白 neutral]]
"I understand what you mean. Sometimes at night, when I recall the past, tossing and turning, unable to sleep, I also use similar words to comfort myself: the past sins are in the past, and now I should look towards the future. But, Seraphina..." [[8183 塞伦安 sad]]
"Even if the past is gone, the sins I committed will not disappear with the passage of time. Instead, they will appear even more unforgivable because of my evasion." [[8184 塞伦安 sad]]
"The past me was indeed a scoundrel. Even if I do more now, I cannot be considered a good person. The sins I committed may not be fully repaid even with this life. Even so, are you still willing to pledge loyalty to someone who will be a sinner forever?" [[8185 塞伦安 sad]]
The night wind brushed through the leaves, rustling, and the bonfire's flames danced with the wind, like the fluctuations in the girl's heart. [[8186 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the wind stopped, and the swaying flames also returned to a steady burn. [[8187 旁白 neutral]]
"I am willing." [[8188 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Even if your past was that of a heinous sinner, even if your future will forever be on the unending path of atonement, even until your life ends and your body falls forever on that endless journey, I, Seraphina, am still willing to follow you, for no other reason than to engrave the path you leave behind with the wind." [[8189 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The burning firelight illuminated the girl's profile, coupled with these extremely sincere words, made Selen An completely feel her pure and genuine heart. [[8190 旁白 neutral]]
For a moment, he actually felt a warmth in his heart, as if something more had appeared. [[8191 旁白 neutral]]
He stepped forward, his feet rustling on the scattered leaves, and came before the kneeling girl in a knight's posture. He bent down and extended his hand to carefully help her up. [[8192 旁白 neutral]]
Their eyes met, reflecting each other's clearest features. [[8193 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you." [[8194 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man's gaze was gentle, and his voice carried a touch of feminine tenderness. [[8195 旁白 neutral]]
"Then, Young Master Selen An, are you willing to accept the loyalty of me, your knight?" [[8196 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Of course." [[8197 塞伦安 neutral]]
Without the slightest hesitation, Selen An nodded. [[8198 旁白 neutral]]
"No time like the present. Let's do it here. Although the environment here is a bit shabby, certainly not as grand as your young lady's Church of the Wind God, I don't like to procrastinate. Since I promised you, I want to hold the conferment ceremony now." [[8199 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man, holding the girl's hand, surveyed the surroundings and said seriously. [[8200 旁白 neutral]]
"As you wish." [[8201 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Good." [[8202 塞伦安 neutral]]
In an instant, the clear young man's voice transformed into the ethereal voice of the Saintess. Seraphina looked up with a slight surprise, seeing that the hand holding hers had, at some point, become more slender and fair. She looked up just in time to meet the other party's pair of azure, teardrop-shaped eyes. [[8203 旁白 surprised]]
To hold the conferment ceremony, it was naturally necessary to switch to the Saintess form. Although frequent form changes might worsen Selen An's feminization symptoms, it was a problem that would have to be faced sooner or later. There was no need to be too afraid, especially for this extremely important and significant matter for both her and Seraphina. [[8204 旁白 neutral]]
Robelia first released Seraphina's hand, creating some distance, then slightly raised her left leg, touching her toes to the ground. [[8205 旁白 neutral]]
Ding~ [[8206 旁白 neutral]]
As her toes touched the ground, the leaf-covered surface seemed to instantly be covered with a film of water. Ripples spread across the calm water film, and a spiritual wall diffused outwards, briefly cleansing an area of 50 meters into an absolutely pure land. [[8207 旁白 neutral]]
The conferment ceremony was an extremely sacred ritual; it could not be disturbed by any unforeseen events. [[8208 旁白 neutral]]
With water shimmering, the blunted holy sword appeared in Robelia's hand. She held the holy sword, her long skirt trailing behind her, and walked with elegant steps towards Seraphina, who was already kneeling on one knee, displaying the knight's禮 to receive conferment. [[8209 旁白 neutral]]
As she took her last step, the tip of the holy sword, carrying an unquestionable majesty, gently touched Seraphina's left shoulder, her voice ethereal and solemn. [[8210 旁白 neutral]]
"In the holy name of Water, I bestow upon you the duty of guardianship—to protect the weak, to protect faith, to protect my path." [[8211 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The sword tip trembled slightly, as if water droplets lightly jingled. The sword blade steadily lifted and moved to her right shoulder, then fell again. [[8212 旁白 neutral]]
"By my true name, Robelia Winterlein, I bestow upon you the covenant of loyalty, like flowing water, loyal to your oath; like a flawless mirror, loyal to your true heart; like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, loyal to my will." [[8213 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Finally, the holy sword, symbolizing the weight of countless waters, lightly touched the crown of Seraphina's bowed head. [[8214 旁白 neutral]]
"With the holy sword as witness, and the sanctity of water as proof, I hereby declare that you, Seraphina, are my Guardian Knight. May your sword point to where my will extends." [[8215 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
As the words fell, a crystal-clear, deep blue water droplet, as if containing the entire ocean, condensed at the sword tip and quietly merged into Seraphina's glabella. [[8216 旁白 neutral]]
There was no dazzling flash of light, only a soft, pure aquamarine mark that flickered across her forehead, like a stone dropped into a calm lake, creating eternal ripples deep within her soul. [[8217 旁白 neutral]]
This was the Saintess's blessing, and also proof of Seraphina becoming the Water Saintess's Holy Knight. [[8218 旁白 neutral]]
At the moment of receiving the blessing, Seraphina felt as if a certain scene had been implanted in her mind. Amidst the hazy water light, she saw— [[8219 旁白 neutral]]
The mouth of a dark abyss, the most defiled place in the world, it would swallow everything that existed, even fleeting light could not escape its grasp. That darkness reached a point where even the meaning of existence could not be felt, a void... [[8220 旁白 fearful]]
Witnessing that ultimate blackness, no despair could even arise in her heart, only a sense of numbness and emptiness, her consciousness uncontrollably scattering. [[8221 旁白 fearful]]
However, in this place of absolute darkness, a wisp of firelight broke this "absolute." Within the muddy swamp of chaotic void, that wisp of light flickered and swayed, making its final struggle. [[8222 旁白 neutral]]
Until a familiar divine voice pierced the deathly silence. [[8223 旁白 neutral]]
"Hestia!" [[8224 旁白 neutral]]
Azure water light, with an absolute overpowering posture, collided with the viscous, lightless chaotic power. The scattering void and suffocating sensation dissipated, and the flickering, almost extinguished firelight also got a momentary reprieve. Under the mutual illumination of the two divine lights, Seraphina finally saw the figure within that initial firelight— [[8225 旁白 neutral]]
Classical European long dress and a white fur shawl covered her peerless figure. A large hood completely concealed her silky chestnut hair. Beneath the hood, those faintly revealed pale purple eyes seemed sorrowful, yet peaceful... [[8226 旁白 neutral]]
She turned her head at that call, but her figure, already deep in the "mud," began to flicker unsteadily. [[8227 旁白 neutral]]
Looking back, Seraphina clearly saw the expression in that figure's eyes, and her chest involuntarily felt a sudden pang of heartache. [[8228 旁白 sad]]
In her eyes, there seemed to be thousands of complex emotions: gentleness, apology, sadness, but not a single trace of hope called survival. [[8229 旁白 sad]]
Her existence was not swallowed only because in her slender hand, she held a handheld oil lamp with a faint burning flame. Countless shimmering light points, like fireflies, surrounded her, and countless whispers seemed to be telling stories, or perhaps lamenting, only the sacred and faint light on her body was comforting these lost and bewildered souls... [[8230 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry, my love, this time we can't be together..." [[8231 赫斯提亚 sad]]
"No, don't!" [[8232 塞拉菲娜 sad]]
The goddess holding the lamp withdrew her last attachment to this world, and with deep guilt, turned and fell. [[8233 旁白 sad]]
"Farewell, my love..." [[8234 赫斯提亚 sad]]
This was the last sound, and the last image. [[8235 旁白 neutral]]
The bonfire illuminated her raised face. The figure of the Water Saintess was reflected in her dark eyes. The blue-haired girl half-supported her forehead, her azure eyes filled with undeniable fatigue and weariness. [[8236 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, I don't know why, but I suddenly feel a bit tired..." [[8237 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
No sooner had she finished speaking than Robelia swayed and fell to one side. Fortunately, Seraphina was quick, darting forward to catch the girl from behind as she lost her balance and fell. [[8238 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, are you alright?" [[8239 塞拉菲娜 fearful]]
Seraphina asked worriedly. [[8240 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm fine... I just suddenly feel a bit sleepy, want to sleep, sleep..." [[8241 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
This time, she didn't even finish her sentence, falling directly into a deep sleep in Seraphina's arms. [[8242 旁白 neutral]]
By the warm bonfire, Seraphina held the unconscious girl tightly. She was about to move to a more comfortable tent when she suddenly noticed a tear on the girl's cheek. [[8243 旁白 surprised]]
This is? [[8244 旁白 surprised]]
Seraphina paused, her eyes widened, and she held her breath, gazing incredulously as a rolling tear slid from the corner of her eye, quietly taking form. [[8245 旁白 surprised]]
She carefully caught the pure pearl that had transformed from the tear, murmuring in shock. [[8246 旁白 surprised]]
"Mermaid's tear..." [[8247 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
............ [[8248 旁白 neutral]]
............ [[8249 旁白 neutral]]
The carriage quietly passed through the scorched earth, ravaged by war. Fully armored knights dismounted, respectfully opening the carriage door. A long white leg extended first from the door, a high heel landing, followed by the flutter of an ice-blue skirt. [[8250 旁白 neutral]]
The knight who had opened the door bowed respectfully and said from the side. [[8251 旁白 neutral]]
"Special Envoy, this is..." [[8252 陌生男1 neutral]]
The knight's words were cut off by the girl's outstretched hand. Her ornate high heels scraped against the scorched earth, making a grinding sound. The silver-haired girl gazed at the ruins, reaching up to gently smooth the stray hairs near her ear, disheveled by the wind. [[8253 旁白 neutral]]
"We are late." [[8254 贝莲娜 sad]]
A clear, ethereal voice echoed in the wind. Her perpetually expressionless poker face unusually showed a hint of regret. [[8255 旁白 sad]]
"Even after rushing, we were still a step too slow?" [[8256 贝莲娜 sad]]
Seeing this, the knight who had opened the door quickly interjected. [[8257 旁白 neutral]]
"Special Envoy, you have traveled thousands of miles to our territory and must be exhausted. Why don't I guide you to a suitable place to rest first? Other matters can be discussed later..." [[8258 陌生男1 neutral]]
"No need." [[8259 贝莲娜 neutral]]
Belena interrupted again. [[8260 旁白 neutral]]
"My purpose for coming this time, I believe His Highness Windermere can guess. Since the person is not here, we won't delay any longer." [[8261 贝莲娜 neutral]]
"This..." [[8262 陌生男1 neutral]]
The knight was at a loss. Logically speaking, a person of the Special Envoy's rank should have been personally greeted by Her Highness the Saintess. After all, the Special Envoy represented the will of another Saintess. However, since the Windermere territory had just experienced an undeserved disaster, Her Highness Celeste, as the Saintess, had to set an example, constantly visiting the affected areas to stabilize the people's morale. [[8263 旁白 neutral]]
Under special circumstances, it was naturally impossible for her to personally meet the Ice Saintess's Special Envoy. But even if Her Highness herself was busy, she should at least have sent a Holy Nun to receive them. Yet, Her Highness did not do so; instead, she specifically appointed a Knight Commander like himself, who had no special background, to take charge of receiving the Special Envoy. [[8264 旁白 neutral]]
The knight did not understand, but it was the Saintess's decree, so he could only bite the bullet. After hearing the Special Envoy's explanation of "the person is not here," he felt even more confused. [[8265 旁白 neutral]]
The only good news was that this Special Envoy did not seem angry about Her Highness the Saintess's slight; instead, she was eager to leave, unwilling to stay for even another second. [[8266 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, right." [[8267 贝莲娜 neutral]]
Belena, who was about to get into the carriage, suddenly took a box from a nun's hand and handed it to the knight. [[8268 旁白 neutral]]
"This box contains the 'Stone of Ages' that the Stone Saintess once gifted to my elder sister. My elder sister originally told me to bring this gift and present it to His Highness Windermere. Now it seems..." [[8269 贝莲娜 neutral]]
"This gift indeed comes at a timely moment." [[8270 贝莲娜 neutral]]
As she spoke, Belena's gaze once again turned to the battle-scarred ruins before her, which still carried the scent of water. [[8271 旁白 neutral]]
