Chapter 60: Old Friend [[3403 旁白 neutral]]
"Andre, I'm truly curious now, how did you guess all of this?" [[3404 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella leaned against the bookshelf, her eyes filled with disbelief. [[3405 旁白 surprised]]
In her opinion, Andre's deductions were completely logical and very likely true. To deduce most of such a complete logical chain from only scattered clues and a tattered historical record—this ability... [[3406 旁白 neutral]]
"I think instead of a priest, you're more suited to be a private detective in one of those detective agencies." [[3407 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"That won't do. Detectives earn wealth by completing tasks, while priests cleanse evil and atone for themselves. My destiny is only suited for the latter." [[3408 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre adjusted his glasses and smiled. [[3409 旁白 neutral]]
What's this? He had lived three lives, after all. Subconsciously living in a technologically advanced modern society, he had countless pieces of information and news stories to draw from daily. With a certain foundation, it wasn't difficult to guess the general development of such stories. [[3410 旁白 neutral]]
"So what do you do now? Report directly to the superior church, or..." [[3411 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Reporting is pointless now. Not to mention, if vampires are truly hidden in that carriage, danger is imminent. Before the superior church can send aid, I fear someone in the town will already be murdered." [[3412 安德烈 neutral]]
"But what if the enemy's strength is beyond our ability to handle..." [[3413 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
"That doesn't matter, Isabella, have you forgotten? Didn't you tell me yourself? The Wind Saintess will inspect this place in less than two weeks. I don't think even the most arrogant vampire could make much of a splash in front of the esteemed Saintess." [[3414 安德烈 neutral]]
"This..." [[3415 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Andre looked at the sky outside the window; the sun was high, in the transition period between noon and afternoon. [[3416 旁白 neutral]]
"Actually, there's another way to verify the truth of a guess." [[3417 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella behind him suddenly spoke. [[3418 旁白 neutral]]
"Are you suggesting, digging up the grave?" [[3419 安德烈 neutral]]
"...Hmm." [[3420 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
The gray-haired nun was surprised that Andre had thought of this so early, and her voice involuntarily lowered. [[3421 旁白 surprised]]
"That is indeed a method. As long as we dig up the grave and pry open the coffin to see if a skeletal corpse or a furry werewolf body lies within, everything can be concluded." [[3422 安德烈 neutral]]
"But now... it hasn't come to that." [[3423 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella sighed, looking at the man's back, and nodded. The reason she hesitated to propose this plan was her consideration for Andre's deep feelings for the old priest. [[3424 旁白 neutral]]
Prying open a coffin would inevitably disturb the deceased's rest. If a werewolf corpse lay inside, it would be fine, but if not, Andre would surely blame himself. [[3425 旁白 neutral]]
"What we need to do now is wait... wait for the sun to set, wait for night to fall, and wait for those evil creatures hidden in the darkness to show their true colors." [[3426 安德烈 neutral]]
If they are vampires, before reaching a certain level, they will instinctively fear holy water, mithril, and sunlight. Therefore, during the day, those undead monsters will hide themselves very well, even completely merging into shadows. [[3427 旁白 neutral]]
Andre didn't think that he, a third-rank priest, could accurately drag them out of the shadows without being familiar with the enemy's situation. [[3428 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, this doesn't mean they couldn't be actively patrolled, but doing so would undoubtedly alert them. Once a battle breaks out, casualties are highly likely, which is something Andre, who has lived in this town for four years, doesn't want to see. [[3429 旁白 neutral]]
After all, he had promised the old man to protect this town. [[3430 旁白 neutral]]
There was still some time until nightfall. Andre handed over all of this afternoon's confession rituals to Isabella and the other young nuns in the church, and he returned to his room alone. [[3431 旁白 neutral]]
He opened the room door, pulled open a drawer, and inside the drawer, demon-hunting bullets made of mithril were neatly arranged. He reached out and took one. The sharp bullet tip shimmered with a pure white luster, and corresponding exorcism runes were engraved in the center of the bullet, with a judgment cross carved on its circular base. [[3432 旁白 neutral]]
Some of these were old man's leftover stock, and some he made himself, all for this very moment. [[3433 旁白 neutral]]
He casually grabbed a handful of demon-hunting bullets from the drawer and scattered them on the table. The crisp sound of metal bullets colliding with the tabletop was like a wonderful symphony. [[3434 旁白 neutral]]
Andre then lifted the velvet interlayer at the bottom of the oak box, where a pair of revolvers, flowing with a cold, moonlight-like glow, lay quietly. [[3435 旁白 neutral]]
The left gun body was entwined with a thorny relief, with a grain-sized luminous stone embedded at the end of each thorn; the right barrel was engraved with an excerpt from the seventh chapter of the "Holy Scripture of Light," and the mithril scriptures, finer than hair, now shimmered with a pearly white radiance. [[3436 旁白 neutral]]
When he grasped the ivory grip engraved with the suffering angel, the empty chambers of both guns automatically popped open. Andre removed his gloves and skillfully loaded the demon-hunting bullets from the table into the chambers one by one. After loading 12 demon-hunting bullets, he habitually flicked the cylinders with his fingertips. The metallic resonance produced by the rotating cylinders was like the most beautiful note in the world. [[3437 旁白 neutral]]
He lightly flicked the gun body, and with a crisp click, the cylinders returned to position. Andre tightly held the two silver killers in his hands, feeling as if the firearms, which were merely inanimate objects, had come to life the moment the bullets were loaded, and the engravings on the gun bodies flickered like breathing. [[3438 旁白 neutral]]
"Whew, old friend, you've rested enough. Tonight, we have work to do." [[3439 安德烈 neutral]]
He gazed at the two guns in his hands, which were truly works of art, with emotion, and muttered to himself as he inserted them into the hidden gun holsters on either side of his body. [[3440 旁白 neutral]]
Thanks to the "Shooting Accuracy" skill that came with his panel, his firearm proficiency should be second only to his "Dedicated Weapon," so he didn't have to fear fatal misfires during combat. [[3441 旁白 neutral]]
When night completely fell, someone knocked on the door outside the room. [[3442 旁白 neutral]]
"Come in." [[3443 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre's calm voice echoed from inside the room. [[3444 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella pushed open the door and saw the familiar man sitting in an armchair, holding a delicate silk scarf and wiping a strangely shaped blade. [[3445 旁白 neutral]]
"What's this?" [[3446 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"A gunblade. You can simply categorize it as a sword." [[3447 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre didn't look up; he just put down the silk scarf and gently caressed the blade, which was as smooth as a mirror. [[3448 旁白 neutral]]
"It's about time. We should leave." [[3449 安德烈 neutral]]
"You're right." [[3450 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Andre nodded. The two gunblades in his hands disappeared as if by magic. He stood up from the chair, picked up the white gloves from the table, put them back on, and with a flick, skillfully draped the white coat from the hanger over himself. [[3451 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella looked at the man before her, whose demeanor had greatly changed, and the emotion in her golden-brown eyes shifted slightly. [[3452 旁白 neutral]]
Arriving at the church gate, Isabella was about to follow the man's footsteps but was stopped by him. [[3453 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll go with you." [[3454 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"No, you stay here." [[3455 安德烈 neutral]]
"Tonight will be dangerous. It's safer if two people go." [[3456 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Perhaps it's not just William's inn that will be in danger. You must understand, if our suspicions are correct, their target is very likely the church." [[3457 安德烈 neutral]]
"If both of us leave, do you expect those young girls, Sena and the others, to guard the church?" [[3458 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre turned his head, and a trace of... a gentle smile appeared on his sharply defined face. [[3459 旁白 neutral]]
"Stay here. I don't want to come back after working all night to find our home taken over by others. You can do that, right, Isabella?" [[3460 安德烈 neutral]]
"...Leave it to me." [[3461 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
The gray-haired nun's expression was complex, but she quickly made up her mind. [[3462 旁白 neutral]]
She watched the priest, dressed in his white coat, his figure receding into the darkness until he was completely out of sight. Only then did she sigh softly, turn back to the church, and close the large doors with both hands. [[3463 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, in the peaceful night, a wind rose—an invisible wall enveloped and protected the entire church. [[3464 旁白 neutral]]
