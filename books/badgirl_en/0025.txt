Chapter 25: Reset 25 - Corrupted [[1460 旁白 neutral]]
The battle between an ordinary person and a demon was like a weak lamb challenging a wolf. [[1461 旁白 neutral]]
But Selen An, armed with the holy sword, was no ordinary lamb. He was a horned goat. The difference in their strength was still vast, but if the wolf wanted to devour the goat, it might get scratched by the sharp horns in the process. [[1462 旁白 neutral]]
Although the bladeless Sword of Peace had never been sharpened, it was still a holy sword. It might not be good for cutting people, but against demons, it dealt pure magical damage. [[1463 旁白 neutral]]
"Clang!" [[1464 旁白 neutral]]
Sharp claws scraped across the sword, creating a harsh noise. Mara's speed was like lightning. Selen An held his sword ready, but could only see a purple afterimage flash past his eyes. Then, she appeared right in front of him, attacking fiercely with her claws. [[1465 旁白 fearful]]
He instinctively raised his sword to block. A piercing sound of metal scraping filled his ears, and the force from the impact made the web of his thumb ache. Having never received any formal combat training, he couldn't hold his weapon steady. [[1466 旁白 fearful]]
He had underestimated the power gap between humans and demons. Even a female succubus, not known for her strength, could crush his head more easily than piercing a sheet of paper. [[1467 旁白 fearful]]
The holy sword spun out of his hand and fell into the snow. [[1468 旁白 fearful]]
Stunned by the blow, he lost his last bit of resistance. Mara seized the opportunity, reached out, and grabbed his throat, securing her victory. [[1469 旁白 fearful]]
Looking at the young man struggling as she held him up with one hand, Mara's face was full of mockery and scorn. [[1470 旁白 neutral]]
She had thought that when Selen An summoned the holy sword, he was about to unleash a powerful move, and they might be locked in a long battle. [[1471 玛拉 neutral]]
But in the end... he was taken down in one hit. How about that? [[1472 玛拉 surprised]]
"A mortal is just a mortal. A weak body, even with a holy sword, cannot change the outcome." [[1473 玛拉 angry]]
Learning from her last mistake, Mara didn't hesitate this time. A continuous stream of enchanting purple demonic energy flowed into Selen An's body. The invading magic, like summoned venomous snakes, spread towards the Succubus Seed in his abdomen, nourishing the restless seed like morning dew... [[1474 旁白 neutral]]
Nourished by the energy, the seed was no longer dormant. Thousands of tiny blood vessels, like roots, extended from its base, digging into his body, into every important vessel and nerve. A deep bud sprouted from the top of the seed, and the sprout grew until a bewitching flower bloomed! [[1475 旁白 fearful]]
The moment the succubus transformation fully bloomed, it released an immense power of corruption, enough to reshape a living being. His weak flesh could not resist this force at all and could only let it freely mold his blood and body into the shape of desire. [[1476 旁白 fearful]]
"Arrrghhhh...!" [[1477 塞伦安 fearful]]
An indescribable pain exploded inside him. Selen An's pupils dilated, and as she choked him, a hoarse, ugly scream escaped his throat. [[1478 旁白 fearful]]
Under Mara's delighted gaze, the changes of the Corruption began: [[1479 旁白 neutral]]
Deep purple demonic energy, like a fire, burned from within Selen An's body and spread to every inch of his skin. Under the corrosion and reshaping of this fire of desire, his broad male frame shrank wildly in an unbelievable way. [[1480 旁白 fearful]]
The Winterlein family's signature blue hair and blue eyes also began to change. His messy, weed-like blue hair lost its sky-blue color, turning a desperate, pale white. In the center of his jewel-like blue eyes, a desire the color of powder pink expanded wildly, eventually taking over his pupils and leaving a tempting heart-shaped pattern in the very center. [[1481 旁白 neutral]]
The fabric on his chest and hips was clearly pushed up by swelling flesh. A strong itch appeared on his forehead, back, and tailbone. The itch grew stronger and stronger, making him want to scratch it, as if something was about to break through the skin from underneath! [[1482 旁白 fearful]]
Mara admired the young man in her grasp, who was in the critical stage of his Corruption. No, from any angle, Selen An could no longer be called a young man. The obvious secondary sexual characteristics and the increasingly tempting curves of his body announced to the world that a new succubus was about to be born! [[1483 玛拉 happy]]
And this succubus was even a descendant of a saintess, carrying noble, divine blood! [[1484 玛拉 happy]]
Once Selen An completely degenerated, it would not only bring utter shame to the Winterlein family but also cast a shadow over the bloodline of every saintess in the world. A descendant of a saintess, proclaimed by the Church to be innately noble and holy, could fall and become the filthiest of succubi in the eyes of the common people. This would be the strongest spiritual blow to all the saintess families and the Church! [[1485 玛拉 happy]]
From then on, whenever people saw a saintess from the Church, they would inevitably think of Selen An, who had degenerated into a succubus. This would become a stain that the Pope, and every member of the clergy, would want to erase but never could. [[1486 玛拉 happy]]
His Majesty, the great Demon King, had calculated everything. The saintesses of this world would eventually become mere pawns in His Majesty's plan to rule the world! [[1487 玛拉 happy]]
The first move begins with the corruption of the water bloodline! [[1488 玛拉 happy]]
"Hmm?" [[1489 玛拉 surprised]]
Time ticked by. Mara frowned as she looked at Selen An, whom she held by the neck, his body burning with purple fire. So much time had passed. Her own corruption ritual as a nun had only taken three or four minutes, but now ten minutes had gone by. Even if the saintess blood in his body had some resistance to the Corruption, it was just an unawakened, useless bloodline. That shouldn't be possible... [[1490 玛拉 surprised]]
Seeing that Selen An showed no more succubus features apart from his hair color and the pattern in his pupils, Mara was surprised, but she also smiled, ready to give the young master who was about to become her sister a little push. [[1491 玛拉 happy]]
She cut the tip of her index finger with her sharp thumbnail. Instantly, the smell of blood with a special scent filled the air. [[1492 旁白 neutral]]
"You're truly an eye-opener, Master. To be able to resist with just your consciousness for so long, I guess you're not as useless as you look. But so what?" [[1493 玛拉 angry]]
"Unable to awaken your bloodline, no matter how smart you are, or how strong-willed you are, you can't gain any freedom from fate's control. People without power can only accept what fate arranges..." [[1494 玛拉 angry]]
"Accept your fate, Master. This is the last moment of your life!" [[1495 玛拉 happy]]
As she spoke, she took advantage of the moment Selen An opened his mouth to scream in pain and inserted her bleeding index finger into his mouth. [[1496 旁白 fearful]]
The purple blood exploded on his taste buds. Selen An, struggling in chaos and pain, felt an irresistible heat sweep through his already terrible body. The evil fire seemed about to consume the last shred of reason he had left! [[1497 旁白 fearful]]
The succubus Mara admired Selen An, whose face and skin were now an unnaturally alluring red. Her narrowed eyes were full of delight. [[1498 玛拉 happy]]
They say a succubus is the incarnation of desire. Mara was here today to clarify that this was not a rumor. Not only is a succubus herself an irresistible creature to males, but even the blood that sustains them has been evolved to have a strong aphrodisiac effect. [[1499 旁白 neutral]]
In other words, when she just dripped her blood into Selen An's mouth, it was like feeding him a super-effective aphrodisiac! [[1500 旁白 neutral]]
Now, no matter how strong Selen An's will was, he would surely be pushed into the abyss by the succubus blood and become a slave to desire. [[1501 旁白 happy]]
