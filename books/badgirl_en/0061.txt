Chapter 61: Entering the Tiger's Den [[3466 旁白 neutral]]
    "Father, why are you tonight..." [[3467 乔琳 surprised]]
    The door of William's Inn opened. A lady wearing a headscarf poked her head out and was surprised to see who was knocking, so she asked. [[3468 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ms. Jolene, I apologize for disturbing your rest. I received a sudden notice that I need to go to Roland Cathedral tomorrow. To save time, I won't be resting at the church. I hope to stay at your place for one night and depart early tomorrow morning." [[3469 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre, dressed in white, was as calm and polite as he was during the day. As he spoke, he subtly winked at Jolene. [[3470 旁白 neutral]]
    The woman who opened the door understood his subtle expression immediately. A smile appeared on her face, and she quickly opened the door, making way for him. [[3471 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh my, it's truly rare for Father to stay at my small establishment. Please come in, please come in. There are still many guest rooms, Father, you can choose whichever you like." [[3472 乔琳 happy]]
    Under the innkeeper's warm welcome, Andre quickly entered the inn. [[3473 旁白 neutral]]
    "Father, which room would you like?" [[3474 乔琳 neutral]]
    Ms. Jolene, with her brown hair, handed a map showing the room locations to the man. At the same time, she pointed to the signs of several rooms and added. [[3475 旁白 neutral]]
    "Rooms seven, eight, and nine are already rented out, Father. If you're choosing, it should be..." [[3476 乔琳 neutral]]
    "Then room eleven it is. I'm not used to living too close to others." [[3477 旁白 neutral]]
    "Okay, I'll get the key for you right away. Please go upstairs first, and I'll send up hot water later. Let me know if you need anything else." [[3478 乔琳 neutral]]
    "Thank you for the trouble." [[3479 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, what are you saying? It's my pleasure to serve Father..." [[3480 乔琳 happy]]
    At night, their conversation was not loud, but these sounds were clearly caught by a pair of sharp, non-human ears hidden in the darkness, meters away and through multiple layers of wood. [[3481 旁白 neutral]]
    Time passed by minute by minute. After the sound of footsteps on the wooden stairs, the crisp jingle of keys opening the door, and the normal sounds of life inside the room, the night seemed to return to silence. [[3482 旁白 neutral]]
    "How is it? Is there a suspect?" [[3483 撒夏 neutral]]
    In the pitch black, two pairs of blood-red vertical pupils opened indifferently. [[3484 旁白 neutral]]
    "It seems to be the church priest of this small town. Listening to their conversation, the priests are going to Roland Cathedral tomorrow. To hurry, they are temporarily staying here for the night." [[3485 陌生男1 neutral]]
    Another voice responded. [[3486 旁白 neutral]]
    "It should be correct. According to the intelligence I've received these past few days, the only threat in this small town is the clergy stationed at the church." [[3487 撒夏 neutral]]
    "The little nuns in the church are not to be feared; they are just fresher blood offerings than ordinary people. The most important ones are the priest and the cleric." [[3488 撒夏 neutral]]
    "The cleric of this church seems to have gone to Roland Cathedral long ago and rarely returned. It looks like one of the descendants of the enemy who achieved great success in sealing has already abandoned their duty." [[3489 撒夏 neutral]]
    "Heh, a thousand years have passed. Even the most steadfast faith has been worn away. Only we, the Blood Clan, can ignore the erosion of time and become the true masters of this world!" [[3490 陌生男1 happy]]
    "This is truly destiny! The witch's descendants have abandoned their duties, and the werewolf's descendants have delivered themselves to our mouths. Is there a better time to strike than now?" [[3491 陌生男1 happy]]
    "Hey, Sasha, calm down. Our plan is to lie in wait here, slowly infiltrate this small town, and then cooperate with Count's plan to take down the church in one fell swoop. I advise you not to alert the enemy." [[3492 古尔波 angry]]
    "No, Gurbog, you're wrong. Obeying Count's orders is important, but sometimes, as a vampire, one must have some ambition. For example, giving the Count a surprise beyond the plan." [[3493 撒夏 neutral]]
    "You mean?" [[3494 古尔波 neutral]]
    "Kill this priest and replace him with one of our own. After all, this is what we're best at. Then, our person will take the priest's appearance and identity back to the church. Since the cleric isn't here, if we kill the priest, it's like we've already succeeded halfway. Isn't this much faster than slowly infiltrating the town, and then besieging the church after turning everyone here into blood slaves?" [[3495 撒夏 neutral]]
    "But what if that priest escapes? After all, according to the Count's previous speculation, the one who inherits the priest's position here generation after generation is very likely to be a descendant of a werewolf. He has the blood of the Wolf King in him, making him stronger at night." [[3496 古尔波 fearful]]
    "Heh, Gurbog, I'd say you're too timid. We have six Blood Clan members here, plus those 'hounds' in the carriage. Even if he's a werewolf descendant and his racial talent is boosted on a full moon night, don't forget that night is also our Blood Clan's home ground..." [[3497 撒夏 angry]]
    "No matter how powerful one werewolf is, can he defeat six of us Blood Clan members, plus the hounds' encirclement? At that time, I probably won't even need to make much noise, and I can separate his head from his body." [[3498 撒夏 happy]]
    "If we occupy the church in advance, we can even get to the seal's location first. If there's a chance to open the seal early, you and I might even gain the appreciation of that Lord and become true blood nobles!" [[3499 撒夏 happy]]
    "Uh... I don't have such grand ideals as you, but just thinking about overthrowing that priest, and all the nuns in the church becoming mine, hehe, I can't even imagine how comfortable it would be to pierce my fangs into a girl's delicate skin and suck on her young and fragrant virgin blood~" [[3500 陌生男1 happy]]
    As he spoke, the figure in the darkness shivered, as if he had already drunk the mythical nectar. [[3501 旁白 neutral]]
    "You're right. Then you can first grab the prettiest one, drag her to the church's main hall, throw her down, and make her watch herself being defiled in front of the statue of the god she believes in. Oh~ that desperate look will surely be beautiful~" [[3502 撒夏 happy]]
    The conversation gradually faded, and their bodies seemed to completely merge into the darkness, shadows flowing on the ground... [[3503 旁白 neutral]]
    In room eleven, Andre, already fully lying down, had his eyes closed and his breathing was steady, looking completely like someone tired and deeply asleep after a long day. [[3504 旁白 neutral]]
    Outside the window, the bright moon hung high. The only sounds he could catch seemed to be the croaking of frogs and chirping of insects hidden beneath the weeds, but all of this was broken by a subtle sound... [[3505 旁白 neutral]]
    "Drip—drip—" [[3506 旁白 neutral]]
    Like dew drops falling from the roof onto the ground. [[3507 旁白 neutral]]
    "Drip—drip—" [[3508 旁白 neutral]]
    Like saliva dripping from a hound's mouth as it smells food. [[3509 旁白 neutral]]
    At some unknown point, the window was obscured by a hazy shadow. The faint moonlight could no longer pass through the gaps into the room, and pitch-black darkness completely enveloped the space. [[3510 旁白 neutral]]
    "Creak~" [[3511 旁白 neutral]]
    The locked door seemed to open by itself, as if gently blown by a night breeze. Immediately after, there was a creaking sound as if heavy objects were pressing on the wooden floor. The sound grew closer, and the scent in the air also became wrong. [[3512 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre's fingers under the thin blanket twitched slightly. The embossed grip of "Silver Killer" pressed under his pillow was emitting a burning pulsation. [[3513 旁白 neutral]]
    He could clearly smell five putrid, sweet, and bloody scents slowly infiltrating the room. The air was also filled with the unique mixture of graveyard moss and decaying roses, characteristic of the Blood Clan. [[3514 旁白 neutral]]
    Every detail confirmed one possibility: those immortal, blood-drinking, pale monsters of legend were slowly approaching. [[3515 旁白 neutral]]
    They're here, they're here! [[3516 旁白 fearful]]
