Chapter 20: Holy Blood [[1205 旁白 neutral]]
When the sharp point of the scissors pierced his palm, cutting the soft skin, a dark red liquid with a faintly sweet smell slid from his fingers and dripped onto the ground. [[1206 旁白 neutral]]
The pain was like a needle pricking his nerves. The color red was like the brightest paint, splashing the most eye-catching color onto the black-and-white scroll of the young man's vision. [[1207 旁白 neutral]]
Pain, blood, dark red... When these real words pulled him back to reality, Selen An realized he had escaped the influence of that mysterious voice. [[1208 旁白 neutral]]
Her voice had disappeared, but the crying continued. [[1209 旁白 neutral]]
Looking at the warm liquid flowing from his palm, Selen An's chest heaved a few times. He clenched his teeth, made up his mind, and in a few large strides, returned to the bedside. Ignoring whether Anna had noticed him, he pried open the woman's jaw and held his throbbing wound to her lips. [[1210 旁白 fearful]]
"You, what are you doing?!" [[1211 安娜 surprised]]
Anna didn't know the truth. She only saw Selen An suddenly rush over, pry open her mother's mouth, and feed his blood to her. [[1212 旁白 neutral]]
Feeding someone blood was already an unbelievable act, especially when her mother's life was in danger. Anna couldn't help but think the worst. The young girl stepped forward to stop him but was pushed back by the young man's other hand. [[1213 旁白 fearful]]
"Be quiet! If you don't want to lose a family member tonight, please calm down... and give me some time..." [[1214 塞伦安 angry]]
Selen An's attitude was unusually firm, but his voice trembled as he spoke. He wasn't sure if what the voice had said was true. [[1215 旁白 fearful]]
Or maybe, in this life-or-death moment, the pressure had been too great, and he had lost his mind, doing something so foolish like a madman. But what if? [[1216 旁白 fearful]]
"Just give me a little time. Let me try. Even if things get worse, can they be any worse than they are now?" [[1217 塞伦安 fearful]]
He muttered to himself while enduring the sharp pain in his palm. [[1218 旁白 neutral]]
It was unclear if he was explaining to Anna beside him or talking to himself. But the fact was, Anna really did quiet down. She hugged her swaddled younger brother tightly, her eyes, red from crying, fixed on the situation on the bed. [[1219 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps even she couldn't believe it. Always rational and realistic, she had actually believed such a ridiculous claim in this situation. But the young man was right about one thing: could things get any worse than they already were? [[1220 旁白 neutral]]
Time passed, second by second. Selen An could clearly feel the blood from his wound flowing into the woman's mouth, carrying his body heat with it, being absorbed little by little. [[1221 旁白 neutral]]
She's drunk so much already, shouldn't there be some reaction? [[1222 塞伦安 fearful]]
The young man's lips trembled uncontrollably. When the blood on the wound dried up, he ruthlessly used the scissors to cut it open again, just to save this family that had fallen into this state because of him. [[1223 旁白 fearful]]
He might not be the original Selen An, but Selen An was indeed a sinner. Occupying this body, he couldn't truly be a passerby and do nothing. [[1224 旁白 sad]]
Just as Selen An was swaying, unable to hold on and about to give up, Anna, who had been watching her mother's condition from the bedside, suddenly shouted excitedly. [[1225 旁白 surprised]]
"It's working, Mr. Selen An, it's working!" [[1226 安娜 happy]]
Seeing the girl's delighted expression, the taut string in Selen An's mind finally relaxed. He lost his footing and stumbled against the corner of the bed, panting heavily. [[1227 旁白 happy]]
With Selen An's continuous blood transfusion, the woman's complexion finally improved. Her pale lips and cheeks regained some color, her rapidly dropping body temperature began to warm up, and the bleeding from her lower body stopped. The hemorrhage seemed to have been staunched. [[1228 旁白 happy]]
After a careful observation, Anna was finally convinced that her mother was out of danger. Just as she cast a grateful look at the young man in the corner, the sounds of fighting from outside exploded in the room like a clap of thunder! [[1229 旁白 surprised]]
The sounds of battle, the storm, and the danger, once held back by a barrier, seemed to lose control and flooded into the small, dark wooden house. Selen An, who hadn't even caught his breath, felt his limbs turn to ice, and the grateful joy on the girl's face froze... [[1230 旁白 fearful]]
The chill of death, mixed with the damp, bloody air, filled everyone's lungs. [[1231 旁白 fearful]]
The old wooden door was practically smashed open. Wind and rain poured into the house, along with a slender figure who desperately held the loose door shut until ice sealed the gap, stopping the wind and rain from pouring in... [[1232 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An looked at the figure in astonishment. Hours of fighting had made her seem like a completely different person. Her ice-blue saintess robe was no longer clean and holy, but stained with blood and mud. She looked as if she had walked out of a mountain of corpses, the smell of blood on her so strong it could make one faint. [[1233 旁白 surprised]]
Leaning against the wall with her sword, her chest rose and fell rapidly. Her breath came out as visible white frost. Her ice sword was covered in flesh and gore, and deep purple blood dripped from the sharp blade, forming a small puddle on the ground. [[1234 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry... I couldn't completely drive the enemies away." [[1235 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
Serenia's words were filled with a clear apology. [[1236 旁白 neutral]]
The Saintess looked at the two people in the room and lowered her head in shame. [[1237 旁白 sad]]
Selen An was dumbfounded. Good heavens... You wanted to fight the entire demon army by yourself and push them back? [[1238 旁白 surprised]]
"Your Highness Serenia, your wounds..." [[1239 安娜 fearful]]
Her mother was out of danger and her brother was born safely. Seeing the Saintess who was almost completely covered in blood, Anna began to worry again. [[1240 旁白 fearful]]
"I'm fine... I had to force the barrier open once, and the demons heard the newborn's cries, which attracted a demon general. This place won't hold for long..." [[1241 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
"You two..." [[1242 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Serenia looked up and saw the young man, who had moved to her side at some point. Having just lost a lot of blood, his face was still pale. He raised his hand toward her, revealing the still-unhealed wound. [[1243 旁白 surprised]]
He swayed on his feet, forcing a smile that was uglier than crying. [[1244 旁白 sad]]
"Want some?" [[1245 塞伦安 neutral]]
Serenia was stunned. She looked at the bitter, helpless smile on the young man's face and, for a moment, was lost in a daze. [[1246 旁白 surprised]]
She had seen such a clean and gentle smile before, on the same person... [[1247 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An didn't know what was on Serenia's mind. He only knew that after seeing it was Serenia who broke through the door, his heart, which had been trembling with fear of death, became incredibly calm. [[1248 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if... as if he and Serenia had faced this kind of desperate situation many times before. There was no need to be afraid, because Serenia was here. [[1249 旁白 neutral]]
"You..." [[1250 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
Serenia frowned when she saw the wound on Selen An's palm. [[1251 旁白 surprised]]
"Don't worry, I didn't do anything bad. I just had a sudden idea to save that lady and tried something. I found out..." [[1252 塞伦安 neutral]]
"My blood seems to have a special healing effect. So, would you like to try it?" [[1253 塞伦安 neutral]]
He offered his blood to the young woman, waiting for her response. [[1254 旁白 neutral]]
