Chapter 101: Trust (Two-in-One) [[5847 旁白 neutral]]
Lobelia sighed in her heart as she looked at the empty cellar. [[5848 旁白 sad]]
Sure enough, the Windermere line were all natural performers. [[5849 旁白 neutral]]
If it hadn't been for Sabella's timely reminder, she might have really been kept in the dark, thinking her identity was well hidden. But now, it seems... [[5850 旁白 neutral]]
Compared to this Wind Saintess, she was truly a bit naive. [[5851 旁白 neutral]]
The phrase "The Wind Saintess is never deceived" contained a lot of information. [[5852 旁白 neutral]]
Deception could be lies, cover-ups, or disguises. In short, any attempt to twist the truth was nothing but a futile effort in Celeste's eyes. [[5853 旁白 neutral]]
So, she had been exposed the first time they met! [[5854 旁白 surprised]]
She had tried her best to cover her tracks then, but Celeste, that black sesame dumpling, had watched her act out the whole time. No, from a certain perspective, they were both watching each other perform. [[5855 旁白 neutral]]
When she and Celeste first met, both had recognized each other's true identities. She relied on her past life's memories, and Celeste relied on the authority of wisdom. The result was that they both recognized each other, but neither exposed the truth; they were both acting... [[5856 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, even though she was currently using Lobelia's identity, a hint of embarrassment and shy blush appeared on the pure Saintess's cheeks. [[5857 旁白 embarrassed]]
Apart from herself, an outsider, the hint of "never being deceived" had already exposed many problems. Her concealment of her identity was a deception, and Seraphina, who had already become a Bloodkin, continuing to disguise herself as a human to serve Celeste was also a deception. [[5858 旁白 neutral]]
The Bloodkin might have been too confident in their disguise techniques. After all, whether from their aura or appearance, the Bloodkin were the closest to humans among the Demon Clan, and they had a natural advantage in disguising themselves. With the right secret arts and items, it was not impossible to fool the Church's detection methods. [[5859 旁白 neutral]]
The soul after the first embrace was similar to a twisted mutation, more like the original soul being shattered, mixed with evil power, and then re-sculpted into a new soul. Since the souls were not the same, the soul contract that guaranteed loyalty would naturally not take effect. [[5860 旁白 neutral]]
Furthermore, Seraphina originally had the identity of a holy nun. Assimilating her into their own kind was equivalent to planting a spy in the enemy's base camp who naturally possessed protective coloring and local residency. [[5861 旁白 neutral]]
Holding this mindset, after assimilating Seraphina, they immediately sent her back, intending to use this newly inserted chess piece by the Saintess to plot the current grand scheme. [[5862 旁白 neutral]]
The plan was very good. If this conspiracy had targeted any of the other Saintesses, it might have succeeded. However, their mistake was choosing the Wind Saintess as their target. [[5863 旁白 neutral]]
The perfect chess piece, so confident in the eyes of the Bloodkin, was undoubtedly a free alarm bell for the Wind Saintess. [[5864 旁白 neutral]]
Even the holy nun beside the Saintess had been assimilated by the first embrace. Any normal person would know they were being targeted by their opponent, so how could they not strengthen their defenses? [[5865 旁白 neutral]]
But at this point, the logic became unreasonable again. [[5866 旁白 neutral]]
If Seraphina had truly been completely controlled by the Bloodkin and become their chess piece, betraying the Saintess she had once sworn allegiance to, then her return to the Church would have only two outcomes— [[5867 旁白 neutral]]
First, the Wind Saintess would see through her non-human nature and grant her death as a release. Second, the Wind Saintess, out of old affection, would spare her life, but she would likely be imprisoned forever in the Church's dungeon, never to see the light of day. [[5868 旁白 neutral]]
Similarly, Seraphina, as Celeste's close confidante, would definitely know her Lady's abilities and trump cards. If she had truly become a Bloodkin lackey, she should have mentioned the Saintess's abilities when the Bloodkin proposed the plan for her to infiltrate the Saintess's side, but she did not. [[5869 旁白 neutral]]
If one were to simulate this past from a third-person perspective, it would seem extremely strange. The Wind Saintess, seeing her confidante whose race had changed after a trip, could still appear normal, smiling as she welcomed her back. Seraphina, knowing she had become an enemy of the Church and could never deceive her Saintess, also acted as if nothing had happened, returning to the Saintess's side as usual and continuing her daily work. [[5870 旁白 neutral]]
Even though two hostile bloodlines now flowed within their bodies, they both knew very well that this seemingly elaborate lie was nothing more than a thin piece of paper that could be torn with a poke, meaningless to both of them. [[5871 旁白 neutral]]
There was also the witch's prophetic ability. If she remembered correctly, Seraphina possessed a portion of witch bloodline even before she was assimilated. [[5872 旁白 neutral]]
It was certain that Seraphina had obtained some extremely important information through her prophetic ability. Because of this information, she conceived a plan, and combined with the previous dialogue, her true goal was still the demon-god-level thorn curse on Celeste. [[5873 旁白 neutral]]
Lobelia could not infer more specific psychological activities, but it was certain that Seraphina had indeed truly accepted the Bloodkin's first embrace. Considering the Wind Saintess's authority of freedom, the Bloodkin's control over Seraphina was absolute, at least physically. [[5874 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, it was absolutely impossible for Seraphina, who had returned to Celeste's side, to leak information about the Bloodkin. Such an important chess piece would certainly be monitored day and night by the Bloodkin through physical means. There was no way Seraphina would have the opportunity to confess or explain her plans and intentions. The only thing she could do was maintain her duty as a holy nun. Only in this way would it align with the normal logic of her Bloodkin spy identity, while also not harming the Wind Saintess. [[5875 旁白 neutral]]
Thus, the "traitor" nun remained silent, and the "blind" Saintess was never deceived. [[5876 旁白 neutral]]
Everything seemed to be developing according to the Bloodkin's plan, and in reality, nothing seemed to have changed... [[5877 旁白 neutral]]
If her inference was largely correct, then even Lobelia herself had to marvel at what kind of power could make these mistress and servant absolutely trust each other, even when one had seemingly become a monster devoid of humanity. Under such naturally antagonistic identities, they could still put on a flawless performance, deceiving the secretly plotting Bloodkin to this day, without a single confession during that time. [[5878 旁白 impressed]]
Perhaps that power was trust itself. [[5879 旁白 neutral]]
After tidying her thoughts, Lobelia looked at Isabella, who was still slumped on the ground, staring blankly. A hint of admiration flickered in her sea-blue pupils. [[5880 旁白 impressed]]
Based on her earlier probing of Isabella's reactions and her comprehensive judgment from their two years of living together, the seemingly cunning but actually straightforward Isabella was unaware of the "playing along" performance that she and her sister and their Saintess were jointly carrying out. [[5881 旁白 neutral]]
Without a "cheat," she would inevitably find it difficult to infer the true facts. Therefore, she was also the one who experienced the most emotional fluctuations and shock upon learning of Seraphina's "betrayal." But even so, she still made the most correct decision—allowing Seraphina to leave with the Wind Saintess. [[5882 旁白 neutral]]
Without the support of truth, what did Isabella rely on to make such a decision, which was practically equivalent to giving up? [[5883 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps it was also trust, just as the Saintess who knew the truth still trusted the witch, and the Bloodkin witch, knowing that her disguise was useless, still returned to the Saintess's side without hesitation. They deeply believed that each other would understand their actions, and Isabella, as a fellow holy nun, was no different... [[5884 旁白 neutral]]
Even when she learned in immense grief that Sister Seraphina had become a traitor and her enemy, she still, in that suffocating situation, chose to believe the other party's words, "In this world, the last people I would harm are you and Lady." She chose to believe that Seraphina was not lying. [[5885 旁白 neutral]]
Choosing trust in sorrow, throwing the spear with unspoken understanding, making the most correct decision, and giving Seraphina a suitable reason to leave immediately. [[5886 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, Lobelia squatted down and tightly hugged Isabella, whose face showed even more shock and confusion. [[5887 旁白 neutral]]
"Huh, Sister Evelyn, I..." [[5888 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"Don't move, Isabella." [[5889 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia's voice, like warm spring water, brushed over Isabella's soul, stopping her trembling. [[5890 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Your body is very weak right now. I'm healing you. Don't worry, what's here is a clone of me. My true body has already rushed to support your Lady. So... relax." [[5891 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The two women embraced. Gentle water elements washed away the dust and dirt from Isabella's cheeks, and pure magic was like the gentle hand of the God of Life, caressing her wounds, wiping away the lingering pain and fatigue. [[5892 旁白 neutral]]
Her body suddenly relaxed, and Isabella leaned softly in Lobelia's embrace, her chin resting on the girl's shoulder. Hot tears wet her clothes, and her golden-brown pupils finally regained most of their usual brilliance. [[5893 旁白 neutral]]
"Did I, did I really do the right thing?" [[5894 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
She asked with a choked voice, like a lost and helpless child asking her mother who held her close. [[5895 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
They say seeing is believing. She had personally witnessed her good sister Seraphina betraying her Lady with a demonic body, and in the subsequent conversation, Seraphina repeatedly uttered inhuman words. [[5896 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
In the eyes of outsiders, Seraphina was completely dead. She had betrayed her faith and vows, assimilated by those undead monsters into the same existence. She had lost her humanity, and all her actions were unforgivable acts of immorality and disloyalty. [[5897 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
As a holy nun facing a traitor, the correct thing to do should have been to keep her no matter what, even if it meant sacrificing her own life, even if she knew she couldn't win... [[5898 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
This was the quality that the Church proclaimed a holy nun should possess: fearlessness, sacrifice, and piety. [[5899 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
But she had just watched the traitor who betrayed her Lady walk away. At this moment, her actions were no different from a traitor in the Church's definition. [[5900 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
But, but Seraphina asked her to trust her. Even though that blonde hair with blood-red eyes was no longer familiar, even though her aura was extremely cold, when she said, "In this world, the last people I would harm are you and Lady," she could no longer raise her gun to stop her. [[5901 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
The person had become strange, but the words were still familiar. [[5902 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
In that orphanage, two young girls huddled together for warmth, enduring countless nights without a future. After being favored by the Lady, they had never been separated for long, sleeping embraced in a new large bed, feeling each other's body temperature and heartbeat when their skin touched. [[5903 旁白 neutral]]
... [[5904 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister..." [[5905 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Leaving the orphanage, in a completely new room, the gentle-faced black-haired girl habitually held her sister with one hand, her dark eyes quietly gazing at the starry sky outside the window, and suddenly spoke. [[5906 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Hmm... Sister, what's wrong?" [[5907 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
The golden-haired girl curled up in her arms, rubbing her eyes, her voice a little sleepy. [[5908 伊莎贝拉 sleepy]]
"In this world, the last people I would harm are you and Lady." [[5909 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The girl's pupils reflected the faint starlight in the night sky. [[5910 旁白 neutral]]
"Sister, why are you suddenly saying such strange things?" [[5911 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
The gray-haired girl was a little confused, but she also sobered up a lot because of it. [[5912 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"Nothing, just a sudden whim." [[5913 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The black-haired girl held the gray-haired girl's delicate body even tighter. [[5914 旁白 neutral]]
After a long silence, she spoke again. [[5915 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Sister." [[5916 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"I'm here, Sister." [[5917 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"If one day I do something that you cannot understand, and you are very sad or angry, at that time, will you still be willing to believe what I say?" [[5918 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"..." [[5919 旁白 neutral]]
There was no reply. The black-haired girl's eyes dimmed a bit. Soon, she felt the girl in her arms tremble, as if she squeezed even harder to her side, until their bodies were extremely close. [[5920 旁白 neutral]]
"Okay." [[5921 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
... [[5922 旁白 neutral]]
Sister, I trust you... So, did I really do the right thing this time? [[5923 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
An uneasy emotion mixed with hot tears, constantly pounding at Isabella's heart. [[5924 旁白 neutral]]
She still remembered that promise from childhood. Now that she had grown up, she didn't know whether this promise and trust would bring blessings or misfortune. [[5925 旁白 neutral]]
"You did the right thing, Isabella." [[5926 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia's voice, as if reading her heart, entered at the right time, giving affirmation to her wavering heart. [[5927 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Your sister and Her Highness, the Wind Saintess, will both be proud of you." [[5928 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
Lobelia gave heartfelt praise. [[5929 旁白 neutral]]
Three companions who absolutely trust each other? [[5930 旁白 neutral]]
No, even without blood ties, this trust and love could absolutely be considered family. [[5931 旁白 neutral]]
Under Lobelia's comfort, the girl's suppressed tears finally turned into sobs, and a pure wind gently swept across this long-sealed land. [[5932 旁白 neutral]]
... [[5933 旁白 neutral]]
... [[5934 旁白 neutral]]
Under the dark night sky, a green coat seemed like a small curtain. Duke Vlad walked through the starry night, gently stroking the metal coffin that had automatically teleported in front of him with his white-gloved right hand, his smile eerie. [[5935 旁白 neutral]]
Even through a glove, at the moment of contact, he could clearly feel the violent shaking of the coffin. It hated his touch. [[5936 旁白 neutral]]
"Hehe, Duchess Cayetana, long time no see~" [[5937 弗拉德 happy]]
The coffin shook more violently. If not for the seal barely holding, Vlad even believed that his handsome face would be severely hit by the coffin lid that might suddenly fly off at any moment. [[5938 旁白 neutral]]
"Buzz~" [[5939 旁白 neutral]]
With a spatial distortion and buzzing sound, the blonde Avril appeared behind Vlad. [[5940 旁白 neutral]]
"Mission complete, Master." [[5941 艾薇儿 neutral]]
Avril's voice was faint, without a hint of emotion. [[5942 艾薇儿 neutral]]
"Hmm~ Well done. As expected of a woman embraced by me. Even the lowest slave will never disappoint me." [[5943 弗拉德 happy]]
Seeing the green-haired beauty frowning and unconscious in Avril's arms, ripples of madness and intoxication spread in his crimson eyes. [[5944 旁白 neutral]]
He was about to reach out and pinch the "Sleeping Beauty's" face, but his hand suddenly froze in mid-air, and the smile on his face stiffened, receding slightly. [[5945 旁白 neutral]]
"Tsk... Useless. As expected, useless. A count actually got counter-killed by a grand magus. Such trash can't give me an ounce of pleasure; it only pointlessly wastes my good mood." [[5946 弗拉德 angry]]
A fourth-tier subordinate died, but Vlad only paused for a moment, then mocked with a disdainful tone. [[5947 弗拉德 angry]]
"Forget it, dead is dead. At least I got what I wanted. Besides, that trash isn't completely dead." [[5948 弗拉德 neutral]]
Looking down at the silent town, in the quiet night, people who had been tired all day fell into dreams, unaware that a catastrophic disaster was slowly unfolding above their heads. [[5949 旁白 fearful]]
"Then, let's begin~" [[5950 弗拉德 neutral]]
Vlad said, and then slapped a mass of soul substance, like a blood-colored flame, into the coffin in front of him. [[5951 旁白 neutral]]
The air was silent for a few seconds. Then, in an instant, a crimson light shot up into the sky, tearing through the night! [[5952 旁白 neutral]]
Along with the blooming light, an extremely ancient aura completely awakened... [[5953 旁白 surprised]]
