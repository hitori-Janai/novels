Chapter 139: Entering the City [[8888 旁白 neutral]]
"Young Master, it's time for dinner." [[8889 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Inside the single room, Serafina, now dressed in a nun’s habit, knocked and entered. She was holding a plate of dinner. [[8890 旁白 neutral]]
The young man, who was hunched over his desk, still didn’t look up, only constantly turning the pages of a book by the light of the kerosene lamp. The room was filled with the rustling sound of turning pages. [[8891 旁白 neutral]]
"Just leave it aside for now. I’ll eat later." [[8892 塞伦安 neutral]]
Serafina placed the dinner on one side of the table and slightly moved a tall stack of books from the other corner. The books were mostly large tomes, mostly related to epic myths. [[8893 旁白 neutral]]
"Are you still worried about what happened this morning?" [[8894 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The girl stood gracefully to the side, her hands clasped over her lower abdomen, asking softly. [[8895 旁白 neutral]]
"Aren’t you asking the obvious?" [[8896 塞伦安 angry]]
Selen An stopped turning the pages of the book, sighed, and pinched the bridge of his nose, his eyes showing unconcealed fatigue. [[8897 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, a faint fragrance wafted into his nostrils, and he felt a pair of slightly cool fingertips resting on his temples, massaging them skillfully and with appropriate pressure. [[8898 旁白 neutral]]
"Does this feel better?" [[8899 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The girl’s voice was still soft. The young man suppressed his momentary surprise and smiled faintly with resignation. [[8900 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you." [[8901 塞伦安 neutral]]
"It’s my duty." [[8902 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Serafina was well aware of Selen An’s current exhaustion. Due to what happened when they entered the city, they immediately rushed to the largest local church in Giant Rock City—the Cathedral of the Rock. [[8903 旁白 neutral]]
Here, they presented their clergy identification and received a warm welcome. Although influenced by local culture, most priests and clergymen in the Ainville territory disliked traveling, but they were quite welcoming to their “own people” who had come from afar. [[8904 旁白 neutral]]
They temporarily had a place to stay. Logically, the first thing Selen An should have done was familiarize himself with the area and its people, but he didn’t. Instead, he requested and received permission from the management to dive headfirst into the church’s library, from which he brought back a thick stack of books to his room, and had been reading ever since… [[8905 旁白 neutral]]
"Serafina, I remember that the land of the Ainville territory is blessed by the divine power of time, and the people of the Ainville territory particularly love recording history, so their collection of historical books here should be the most complete, right?" [[8906 塞伦安 neutral]]
The aroma of food constantly tempted Selen An’s already hungry stomach, but he had no intention of eating now. Instead, he asked Serafina this seemingly meaningless question. [[8907 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes, due to the protection of the God of Time, the collection of books at the Cathedral of the Rock God is incomparable even to that of the Cathedral of the Wind God." [[8908 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Although we are not at the Cathedral of the Rock God, and Giant Rock City is a large city, the Cathedral of the Rock is not an obscure small church like the Kempfer Church. Today, I have almost quickly reviewed all the books related to divine epics, and even so…" [[8909 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I couldn’t find any trace of the name Hestia in the books." [[8910 塞伦安 sad]]
A brief silence fell in the air. [[8911 旁白 neutral]]
"Young Master, generally, there are only two possibilities for this situation…" [[8912 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Serafina deliberated for a moment, organizing her words, and slowly spoke. [[8913 旁白 neutral]]
"First, regarding this deity named Hestia, if she truly existed in history and has now completely vanished, it is highly possible that this deity once touched upon some forbidden world secret. The severity of this forbidden act caused the gods to have to erase her existence, and naturally, there would be no trace of her in books." [[8914 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Second, this deity named Hestia perished before human civilization was fully established. She was annihilated in the Creation Era, and naturally, there would be no human written records of her past." [[8915 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
The flame in the kerosene lamp flickered, stirring up black soot. [[8916 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An took a deep breath, covered his face with his hands, and then slowly exhaled a long, turbid breath. [[8917 旁白 neutral]]
"Now it seems there are only these two possibilities. Since there’s no record in books, the possibility of getting useful information by asking people is even slimmer, and it might even attract unnecessary attention. Since we’re new here, it’s best not to act too unusually." [[8918 塞伦安 neutral]]
Although he said so, the problem remained unsolved, and he still felt as if a stone was weighing on his heart. [[8919 旁白 sad]]
"Due to lack of information, we can indeed only stop here for now, but Young Master, if you truly urgently want an answer, there seems to be another way." [[8920 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"What way?!" [[8921 塞伦安 surprised]]
The young man, who had been sprawled on the table like a salted fish, immediately perked up, his eyes full of light. [[8922 旁白 neutral]]
"Young Master, didn’t you say that you unconsciously uttered the name Hestia because you accidentally saw a pendant similar to a gem sword that Miss Windsor pulled out? And what we know now is that the name Hestia is most closely related to the Water Saintess bloodline within you…" [[8923 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Since Young Master’s male body can produce a wondrous resonance with that pendant, then if Young Master observes or directly touches it in the form of the Water Saintess, you are highly likely to get unexpected results." [[8924 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Clap!" [[8925 旁白 neutral]]
His fist slammed into his palm, and the young man abruptly sat up. [[8926 旁白 neutral]]
"That’s right! If I interact with it in Lobelia’s form, the effect will definitely be stronger than in my male form, but…" [[8927 塞伦安 neutral]]
The excitement faded, and a helpless, troubled expression appeared on Selen An’s face again. [[8928 旁白 sad]]
"The risk of doing that is too great." [[8929 塞伦安 fearful]]
"Setting aside how to quietly obtain that pendant from Miss Elf, even if I can’t solve it, this isn’t Windermere after all. The curfew and patrol intensity in Ainville territory are far greater than in a small town like Kempfer. If the energy fluctuations are too large during the transformation, it’s highly likely to attract the attention of patrol guards and the church." [[8930 塞伦安 fearful]]
Ultimately, big cities have stricter rules, and local cultures also differ. The freedom of Windermere always offers many conveniences, while Ainville’s protection is more reflected in its steadfastness and strictness. [[8931 旁白 neutral]]
"By the way, where is the Rock Saintess now?" [[8932 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An suddenly thought of a crucial question—Saintesses. The magical fluctuations of Saintesses are different from ordinary people, but with a little concealment, they won’t be easily discovered. However, if they are both Saintesses, due to the principle that divine blood resonates with each other, it will easily expose the disguised party. [[8933 旁白 neutral]]
This feeling would exist even if they weren’t face-to-face, but at a certain distance, there would still be an indistinct perception. [[8934 旁白 neutral]]
"Based on the information I knew before, Miss Constance is currently at the border north of the Empire’s northern territory." [[8935 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Why isn’t she staying in her own fiefdom and running off to that godforsaken place?" [[8936 塞伦安 confused]]
Selen An frowned. The area north of the Empire’s capital was bitterly cold, an even harsher environment than the ungreened Craigmore Wasteland. Not only was the environment bad, but the bitter cold region was also full of dangers, with various fierce demonic beasts like Yetis and Cold Ridge Wolves appearing one after another. [[8937 旁白 neutral]]
No one with a normal brain would go there. [[8938 塞伦安 angry]]
"Wall building." [[8939 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"? Building what wall?" [[8940 塞伦安 surprised]]
"Young Master, you really need to catch up on your history lessons." [[8941 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Serafina sighed helplessly and could only patiently give this semi-illiterate priest a temporary lesson. [[8942 旁白 neutral]]
"The Rock Saintess is a descendant of the God of Rock, with corresponding divine blood flowing within her. Influenced by her divine blood and corresponding faith, almost every Rock Saintess’s main lifelong activity is building walls…" [[8943 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"The Rock Saintess uses her exquisite earth magic to raise magnificent city walls from flat ground, thereby resisting external dangers and protecting the citizens of the Empire. Over time, there are also rumors that where the Rock Saintess is, that is the safest place." [[8944 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"So, this generation’s Rock Saintess, Miss Constance, is no exception. She is almost daily either building walls or on her way to build walls. Affairs within the Ainville territory are almost entirely discussed and resolved by her family and the four great noble families." [[8945 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Serafina was diligently giving her lesson, while Selen An, listening, had a somewhat strange expression. [[8946 旁白 neutral]]
"Four great families? Such a familiar setting. Is there going to be some Dragon King Son-in-Law script next?" [[8947 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Young Master, what nonsense are you talking about?" [[8948 塞拉菲娜 confused]]
"Nothing, just pretend I was rambling." [[8949 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man waved his hand, indicating not to worry. [[8950 旁白 neutral]]
"Speaking of the four great noble families, Miss Windsor, whom we met today, the badge she showed represents one of the four great families’ knights, Lowell." [[8951 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Oh right, I do have some impression. That city guard captain immediately stood at attention after seeing that badge, with loyalty practically written all over his face." [[8952 塞伦安 neutral]]
With only two people in the room, Selen An naturally teased freely without much concern. [[8953 旁白 neutral]]
"That’s normal. Lowell, as an ancient knight family, holds considerable prestige in the army. There are rumors that every head of the Lowell family is at least a Tier 5 Skyfire Knight, and the first head of the Lowell family was a Tier 6 Holy Judge." [[8954 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"That powerful?!" [[8955 塞伦安 surprised]]
Even Selen An couldn’t help but exclaim now. [[8956 旁白 neutral]]
Tier 5 is considered the threshold for high-end combat power in this world, and Tier 6 is the strongest combat power below a demigod. This Lowell family’s head is at least Tier 5 in every generation, and as knights, it’s no wonder they hold such high prestige in the army. [[8957 旁白 neutral]]
But… [[8958 旁白 neutral]]
Why would Windsor, a Moon Elf, possess a Lowell family badge? [[8959 塞伦安 confused]]
Putting that aside, the person this Miss Windsor is looking for is also very special: a female Water Mage with blue hair and blue eyes, and skilled in water magic. Hiss… there’s a high overlap with himself~ [[8960 塞伦安 confused]]
If she’s really looking for him, Selen An would be puzzled. It’s understandable for the Church to look for him at this time, understandable for the Winterlein family to look for him, and even for Serenia to look for him, he could accept that. But the Elves, he remembered having no contact or connection with the Elves before, did he? [[8961 塞伦安 confused]]
Why are these long-lived, long-eared people suddenly looking for him? [[8962 塞伦安 confused]]
No, not looking for him, but looking for Lobelia. He just felt that before his bloodline awakened, the whole world was spurning him, and after his bloodline awakened, the whole world was looking for her. For a moment, he had the illusion of being the heroine in a “chasing wife to the crematorium” plot. [[8963 塞伦安 neutral]]
"By the way, while you were reviewing the texts, Miss Windsor also paid a visit, saying she wanted to inquire about your condition. I told her not to worry as per your instructions and to come back another day." [[8964 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Hiss~ So attentive to me? Has my handsome appearance captured her heart?" [[8965 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man rubbed his chin, feigning a troubled expression. [[8966 旁白 neutral]]
Serafina’s mouth twitched, a rare occurrence. [[8967 旁白 neutral]]
"Young Master, although you do have delicate skin and tender flesh, the Elves never lack beautiful men and women. There, regardless of gender, the average appearance level is exceptionally high, so your claim of capturing a Moon Elf’s heart with your looks is likely overly confident." [[8968 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Tsk… Can’t you say something nice?" [[8969 塞伦安 angry]]
"If Young Master were in a female form right now, I would never say the above words. But in male form, please forgive me for being unable to force myself to lie like that." [[8970 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Serafina actually had her own set of justifications. She was loyal to the Water Saintess Lobelia, not to Father Andrew or the young villain Selen An. If he really wanted to pull rank on her, fine, but he should make his chest swell first. [[8971 旁白 neutral]]
She was certain that if it were Miss Lobelia, she would never dwell on such childish topics. [[8972 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, divine blood had a very significant impact on a person’s character. Even for the same person, the way of thinking exhibited under divine blood dormancy and divine blood boiling was completely different. [[8973 旁白 neutral]]
But ultimately, Serafina herself didn’t know if she preferred Miss Lobelia more, or Selen An more. This decision, which would be easy for ordinary people to make, became hesitant for her— [[8974 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps because she had interacted with two Saintesses, Serafina’s understanding of Saintesses far surpassed that of ordinary people. Divine blood, which ordinary people considered a gift from God, was in fact, perhaps not so wonderful. Indeed, these young women with divine blood possessed perfect beauty and powerful strength, but this also bound their destinies completely to the wheel of history. The moment they succeeded, every Saintess had to erase a part of their “self,” making room for the duties they had to fulfill. [[8975 旁白 neutral]]
On the path ahead, perfect divine blood removed the “give up” option for them, because in the process of fighting against demons, the consequences of giving up were far crueler than death. [[8976 旁白 neutral]]
And just as she saw— [[8977 旁白 neutral]]
The free Saintess was not free, and the peace around the peaceful Saintess was fragile and shattered… [[8978 旁白 sad]]
"What’s wrong? You suddenly frowned, looking as if someone owes you a lot of money?" [[8979 塞伦安 neutral]]
"No, I’m fine. Young Master, it’s late. Please eat first. I’ll think of a way to resolve these issues for you." [[8980 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Perhaps. Every day is restless, when will it end...?" [[8981 塞伦安 sad]]
... [[8982 旁白 neutral]]
... [[8983 旁白 neutral]]
Meanwhile, Mila, who had somehow sneaked into Giant Rock City, was hidden in the shadows. The sky gradually darkened, and the number of pedestrians on the road gradually decreased, leaving only the strict and orderly patrol teams. [[8984 旁白 neutral]]
The air was filled with the scent of humans, but this didn't hinder her from pursuing her goal. Looking up at the magnificent cathedral, the succubus in the shadows curved her lips into a subtle smile. [[8985 旁白 neutral]]
"Does Her Highness really enjoy coming to this kind of place to experience life?" [[8986 米菈 neutral]]
"Well, since Her Highness enjoys playing the priest, then I shall play the pure and lovely nun by the priest's side~" [[8987 米菈 happy]]
