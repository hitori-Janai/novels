Chapter 35 Reset 35: Almost Killed by You [[2022 旁白 neutral]]
Ice and frost stole the warmth of life, covering this corner of the world in a deep, unshakable silence. [[2023 旁白 sad]]
As far as the eye could see, the wasteland had instantly turned into a snowfield. Heaven and earth were indistinguishable, connected by a monotonous paleness. Thousands of demon soldiers, along with their war beasts, were frozen into ice sculptures, as if time had been frozen in a single instant. [[2024 旁白 neutral]]
After Serenia recklessly unleashed the forbidden spell, everything here was buried with her in a curse of frigid, unmelting ice. [[2025 旁白 sad]]
This was the deepest revenge a Saintess could take in her utter desperation. It was a miracle borrowed from the Ice God of Judgment, for which a descendant of the gods willingly paid with her life. [[2026 旁白 sad]]
Kog'sa paid the price for his arrogance and greed. But as a Great Demon, his life force was monstrously strong. A final, desperate attack from a dying Saintess was not enough to kill him. [[2027 旁白 fearful]]
The moment he faced the forbidden spell, he truly felt the presence of death. The judging cold almost claimed his life; the bone-chilling frost that made his soul tremble contained a divine power that could not be resisted. [[2028 旁白 fearful]]
His limbs and torso had completely lost sensation, and the boiling demon blood in his veins had frozen solid. His body, one could say, was completely frozen and dead from facing Serenia's suicidal forbidden spell. [[2029 旁白 neutral]]
If nothing unexpected had happened, this would have been the war's outcome. Neither of the mortal enemies had won. After both sides paid a great price, the only things left were the ice sculptures of the fighting, frozen on the silent plain. [[2030 旁白 sad]]
But... in this world, it wasn't only the six creator gods who dared to call themselves deities. Humans weren't the only ones; the Demon Clan also had their own Demon Gods to worship. [[2031 旁白 surprised]]
The ice that could seal anything was certainly powerful, but across the entire continent of Nephalem, it was not without powers that could rival it. [[2032 旁白 neutral]]
For example, Flauros, known among the Demon Gods as the Grand Duke of Hell. [[2033 旁白 neutral]]
"Thump—!" [[2034 旁白 neutral]]
On the pale ice field, a strong and powerful heartbeat broke the dead silence. In the center of the forbidden spell's explosion, the ash-like aura that could burn everything was radiating from inside an ice sculpture. [[2035 旁白 fearful]]
The ice of judgment had indeed killed this body, but it had not killed it completely. In the Great Demon's chest, a demonic heart was breaking free from the ice's grip, pumping boiling hot blood from hell to the corners of his numb body. [[2036 旁白 fearful]]
An indescribable hellfire ignited his body. It burned from within the ice that held him, melting the ice prison that should have been impossible to break. [[2037 旁白 surprised]]
"Ugh... ah...!" [[2038 Kog'sa angry]]
With the crisp sound of cracking ice, mixed with a hoarse voice, Kog'sa, covered in flames, melted the front layer of the ice sculpture. He then moved his torso, abandoning his dead limbs. After forcibly breaking his own arms and legs, his torso and head rolled onto the snow like a grotesque human trunk. [[2039 旁白 fearful]]
At this moment, he had lost all his former majesty. The black armor attached to his body had become as fragile as glass from the frost. Without his lower body, he lost the imposing pressure he once had and became ugly and miserable. [[2040 旁白 sad]]
But none of that mattered. What was important was... he had survived! [[2041 旁白 surprised]]
Controlling his limbless body, he struggled to move to a corner of the original ice sculpture and leaned against it to sit up. Kog'sa's eyes still flickered like the fires of hell, but the light was no longer as strong as before. He was weak and barely hanging on. [[2042 旁白 neutral]]
He stared intently at the beautiful ice sculpture right in front of him. Through the ice, he could vaguely see the girl's stunning face and pale lips. She looked as if she were asleep, with her eyes tightly closed. [[2043 旁白 neutral]]
But Kog'sa knew she would never wake up again! [[2044 旁白 happy]]
His eyes flashed with relief and a deepening, venomous hatred. Kog'sa coughed violently, spitting up several mouthfuls of blood thick with the poison of the cold. [[2045 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh... heh... You almost killed me, you brat..." [[2046 Kog'sa angry]]
With blood still on the corner of his mouth, Kog'sa leaned against the ice sculpture. As his chest heaved, countless flesh tendrils began to writhe at the wounds where his limbs had broken off. Fire reshaped his flesh, and magma formed his bones. [[2047 旁白 fearful]]
His terrifying life force, which allowed him to heal and recover after losing his limbs, was enough to make most creatures on this continent tremble in fear. Compared to humans who would be permanently disabled if they lost their limbs, the Great Demon's seemingly immortal ability was simply undefeatable! [[2048 旁白 fearful]]
A few minutes later, Kog'sa controlled his newly grown limbs and stood up from the snow. He walked, weak and stumbling, to Serenia's ice sculpture. [[2049 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, he had returned to his previous condescending self. He glanced at the girl slowly dying inside the ice, his eyes full of contempt and mockery. [[2050 旁白 neutral]]
"No matter what, this time... I have won." [[2051 Kog'sa happy]]
His fiery demonic power formed a long-handled great axe in his hand, and a fierce glint flashed in his black and red eyes of hell. [[2052 旁白 angry]]
"Since you are unwilling to be my wife, then you can go to hell with this body!" [[2053 Kog'sa angry]]
Inside the ice sculpture, the girl remained curled up and asleep. Outside, the mirror-smooth surface of the ice reflected the demon from hell, raising his slaughtering axe, intending to kill the sleeping beauty in the ice. [[2054 旁白 fearful]]
Tick— [[2055 旁白 neutral]]
The flow of time became incredibly slow. The fate of this continent had reached a critical point. [[2056 旁白 neutral]]
Kog'sa felt that the axe swinging down in his vision was being twisted by an unseen force. No matter how hard he tried, the axe, whose blade was already near the ice, just wouldn't come down. [[2057 旁白 surprised]]
What's happening? [[2058 旁白 surprised]]
At the critical stage of eliminating the threat, such a strange thing happened. Kog'sa felt a little alarmed and uncertain. [[2059 旁白 fearful]]
Serenia's forbidden spell had already severely injured him. If another accident were to happen now, the following events might truly spiral out of his control. [[2060 旁白 fearful]]
A barely noticeable drop of sweat slid down his ugly cheek. He suddenly realized something that he found unbelievable. [[2061 旁白 surprised]]
The great axe in his hand had stopped not because of a so-called time stop or an invisible force, but... he had stopped himself! [[2062 旁白 surprised]]
How is that possible? [[2063 旁白 fearful]]
He questioned himself in his mind, but no matter how many times his brain gave the command to attack, his hands kept trembling, as if resisting the order. [[2064 旁白 fearful]]
Is it mental magic? Magic that can temporarily take control of another's body. [[2065 旁白 neutral]]
This was the first guess that flashed through his mind. His own body fighting against his will—this strange phenomenon was the specialty of mages or sages who excelled in mental or spiritual magic. [[2066 旁白 neutral]]
But he quickly dismissed this guess, because... [[2067 旁白 surprised]]
He heard a song. [[2068 旁白 surprised]]
