Chapter 40: Reset 40 — Oath of No War [[2272 旁白 neutral]]
"What is that?" [[2273 克格萨 surprised]]
Kogsa stared at the emerald barrier that had appeared out of nowhere, his voice a hoarse whisper. [[2274 旁白 neutral]]
The ancient tree that had materialized from nothing hadn't caught his attention at first. Although it was a bit large, he had dismissed it as a random product of the Water Saintess's vision. But he never expected... [[2275 旁白 neutral]]
...that the tree could emit such an astonishing life aura. [[2276 旁白 surprised]]
No matter how strong a life force was, it would be annihilated into ash in the face of the "Great Annihilation." [[2277 旁白 fearful]]
The destructive power brewing in the sky continued to expand. Once it reached a certain threshold, the "Great Annihilation" would raze everything here to the ground. [[2278 旁白 fearful]]
Inside the barrier, it seemed all danger was kept at bay, but Serenia knew this was only temporary. Once the death star in the sky fell, they would all... [[2279 旁白 fearful]]
"Serenia..." [[2280 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The call from the girl named Lobelia suddenly broke the heavy atmosphere inside the barrier. Serenia was stunned for a moment, then immediately responded. [[2281 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm here." [[2282 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"Tell me... why must there be war in this world?" [[2283 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
Such a broad question caught Serenia completely off guard. [[2284 旁白 neutral]]
At a moment of life and death, for the other person to suddenly raise such a deeply philosophical question was completely irrational. But when she met Lobelia's droplet-like eyes, which were as calm as still water, all the chaos in her heart quieted. [[2285 旁白 neutral]]
She took a deep breath, and after a moment of consideration, gave her answer. [[2286 旁白 neutral]]
"Because of conflict. Conflict between people, between nations, between races, and even between gods. Conflict is what leads to war." [[2287 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"Then why is there conflict?" [[2288 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia pressed on. [[2289 旁白 neutral]]
"Because of desire and injustice. Desire drives people to want more, and in the process of trying to get more, injustice is created. That is where conflict comes from." [[2290 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
... [[2291 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The blue-haired girl didn't ask any more questions. She just crouched down and gently stroked the soft grass beneath her feet. [[2292 旁白 neutral]]
"So, for the sake of one's own selfish desires, is it okay to just take the lives of others?" [[2293 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
"Lobelia..." [[2294 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
Serenia sensed that something was wrong with the blue-haired girl's tone and couldn't help but call out her name in worry. [[2295 旁白 fearful]]
"It's alright. Actually... I understand all of this." [[2296 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
The girl stood up, turned her head, and gave a gentle smile. But buried within that smile were complex emotions, like guilt and self-blame. [[2297 旁白 sad]]
Did she ask these questions because she was truly a naive girl who didn't understand the ways of the world? [[2298 旁白 neutral]]
No, she understood. Among all the Water Saintesses in history, she was likely the one who understood this truth the best. [[2299 旁白 neutral]]
After all, she had done these things with her own hands, staining them with the blood and cries of countless innocent people. [[2300 旁白 sad]]
But it was precisely because she had experienced it firsthand that she understood how sinful and unforgivable such actions were, just like the sinful self she now carried... [[2301 旁白 sad]]
"War only brings death and pain, but sometimes, living beings have no choice but to use war to defend what they have. War itself is not wrong. What's wrong is the side that harbors selfish desires, unjustly provokes conflict, and initiates the war." [[2302 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
Perhaps the sins of the past surfaced before her eyes, causing her to close them instinctively. The weight of it, like a tidal wave, crushed her until she could barely breathe. But escaping was not an option. The moment she became Lobelia, it signified that she would repay this sin, no matter the cost. [[2303 旁白 fearful]]
Even if she spent her whole life, she could not repay it all. Even if she shed all her blood, she could not cleanse herself. But once on this path, there was no turning back, no regret! [[2304 旁白 neutral]]
So... if the world's wars, born of conflict and injustice, could never end, then she, Lobelia, would intervene. Even if war could not truly be ended, she would do her part. [[2305 旁白 neutral]]
Save one more person, please. Let her save just one more innocent soul caught in the crossfire before her strength gives out! [[2306 旁白 sad]]
The girl's noble conviction ignited the flame of a miracle. The world's gate opened to her. The goddess of peace shed her blood as sweet dew, establishing the first divine oath in this world. [[2307 旁白 surprised]]
[Divine Art • Oath of No War] [[2308 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike Serenia's earlier [Divine Art • Pale Dragon's Glacial Roar], there was no vast power that caused a great vision, no brilliant divine light, and no divine art matrix connecting heaven and earth. It was merely a flash of golden divinity in the girl's right eye, and the seal of the oath covered her droplet-pupil. [[2309 旁白 neutral]]
The holy sword of peace materialized from the light. Lobelia did not hold it with both hands, but embraced the unsharpened sword in the most gentle manner. [[2310 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, outside the barrier, the deadly thunder roared and the storm was about to reach its peak. Just as Kogsa thought he was about to witness the tragic fall of two saintesses, the burning scroll floating in mid-air... [[2311 旁白 neutral]]
...fell, landing right on his head and dropping by his feet. [[2312 旁白 surprised]]
Kogsa touched his head, a series of question marks popping up over it. He first looked at the object by his feet, rubbed his eyes, suspecting a trick of the light, then looked again. He confirmed it; he wasn't seeing things. [[2313 旁白 surprised]]
How did this already activated scroll just fall down? [[2314 旁白 surprised]]
He scanned his surroundings but found nothing unusual. The two saintesses were still inside the barrier created by the ancient tree. Besides the Water Saintess suddenly holding a holy sword with an exceptionally peaceful posture, there seemed to be no other surprises. [[2315 旁白 neutral]]
He quickly bent down to pick up the scroll and check what was wrong, but as he did, a golden ray of sunlight shone on the back of his outstretched hand. [[2316 旁白 surprised]]
Kogsa's body stiffened, and his head mechanically looked up. It wasn't until the scorching sun, too bright to look at directly, burned his eyes that he realized in horror that the "Great Annihilation," which had been gathering power to its final stage, was gone... [[2317 旁白 fearful]]
No, it wasn't just gone. It was more like the "Great Annihilation," on the verge of being unleashed, was snuffed out by an irresistible force. [[2318 旁白 fearful]]
It was like preparing for a cannon shot for ages, stuffing the shell into the barrel, the fuse already burned away. Just as the artilleryman covered his ears, ready for the deafening blast, a puff of smoke came out of the muzzle, firing a completely silent dud. [[2319 旁白 surprised]]
Realizing the situation was lost, Kogsa's eyes locked onto the girl peacefully holding the sword, as if tracing the source of it all. [[2320 旁白 fearful]]
For crying out loud! [[2321 克格萨 angry]]
He had thought the troublesome Will of No War was the Water Saintess's trump card. Now he knew that was just a passive skill that triggered automatically. She had been saving her real ultimate move for him, hadn't she? [[2322 旁白 angry]]
As expected of the Saintess of Peace. So, by forcibly disabling all damaging abilities, this is how you maintain peace? [[2323 旁白 angry]]
Kogsa stood alone on the grass, silently enduring the sun's glare, feeling completely bewildered... [[2324 旁白 angry]]
And for Lobelia, as she activated her divine art, a golden panel automatically opened in her changed right eye. [[2325 旁白 neutral]]
