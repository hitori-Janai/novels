Chapter 124: Return to the Battlefield [[7358 旁白 neutral]]
Vlad had just barely managed to snatch his brain back from Sigrid's hands. Cupping his head, he finally reconnected his brain to his neck. Just as he was thinking it was his turn to counterattack and had assumed a combat stance, his soul suddenly trembled, and a wail was heard. [[7359 旁白 fearful]]
"Ugh, ahhh!" [[7360 弗拉德 fearful]]
The handsome, demonic man's face was distorted beyond human recognition. His ten fingers dug deeply into his brain, and blood spurted from his knuckles, yet he seemed to feel no pain as his body swayed from side to side. [[7361 旁白 fearful]]
Medya watched the suddenly tormented Vampire Duke, feeling quite bewildered. She didn't know if his mind had suddenly snapped, or if he was just putting on a performance in the middle of the battle, or if this was truly happening. But if it was real, who could inflict such immense damage on a Six-Tier without a sound? [[7362 旁白 surprised]]
Sigrid, holding her sword, seemed to sense something. Instead of seizing Vlad's momentary stiffness, she turned her head to look in the direction of the inverted cross. [[7363 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems to have worked." [[7364 西格利德 happy]]
Her voice was always cold and flat, but at this moment, it carried a rare hint of satisfaction. [[7365 旁白 neutral]]
"What worked?" [[7366 梅黛亚 neutral]]
Medya wasn't as relaxed as Sigrid. On one hand, she had to be wary of whether Vlad was merely faking his pain to lower their guard before suddenly attacking. On the other, she couldn't understand what Sigrid meant by "worked." [[7367 旁白 fearful]]
The relationships on this battlefield were simply too confusing for her. One moment, Avira, the Duke's loyal dog, was desperately stopping her from approaching the inverted cross. The next, she pulled a long spear from somewhere unknown and, at the cost of her own life, threw it to pierce the Saintess's chest. [[7368 旁白 surprised]]
"The wind is rising..." [[7369 西格利德 neutral]]
Sigrid raised her hand, her cool fingertips tracing the air, as if feeling the flow and change of the wind. [[7370 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, a crisp sound of metal chains breaking echoed in their ears. The unconscious girl, her chest stained with blood, suddenly opened her eyes. Thousands of wind currents danced around her, and the eyes that had abruptly opened were equally strange. [[7371 旁白 surprised]]
Her left eye was scarlet, her right eye emerald green, and her emotionless silver hair seemed covered by thin layers of green light. Having awakened, she lowered her head to look at her chest, pierced by the cross spear. There was no astonishment, no fear, not even basic pain on her face. Only her slender fingers gripped the spear handle, pulling the blade from her flesh inch by inch without hesitation. [[7372 旁白 neutral]]
Witnessing this incredible process firsthand, Medya sharply noticed an unusual magical fluctuation in the air. The witch's high sensitivity to magic made her instinctively turn her head. The anomaly came from Sigrid. Every inch of spear blade Selen An pulled out caused an almost invisible, transparent ripple to emanate from the vampire girl's body. [[7373 旁白 surprised]]
Imperceptibly, with each ripple, a breath of life seemed to leak from the girl's fingertips, used to replenish those lives that should have fallen into eternal sleep. [[7374 旁白 neutral]]
The more Medya watched, the more she was startled, instinctively swallowing. Everyone said that Five-Tiers had already entered the high-end combat power of the Nephalem Continent. She was a pure-blood witch, capable and knowledgeable, so why did this battle make her, a respectable Five-Tier, increasingly shocked the more she watched? [[7375 旁白 surprised]]
It was as if, on the entire battlefield, there wasn't a single normal or ordinary being besides her. [[7376 旁白 neutral]]
Free from the chains, Celeste, whose situation was somewhat unique, first cast her heterochromatic eyes towards Sigrid. After recognizing the vampire girl's face, Celeste paused, then nodded somewhat vaguely, her lips curving into a smile. [[7377 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you." [[7378 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
From not far away, she softly thanked her, completely disregarding Vlad, who was grimacing in pain. [[7379 旁白 neutral]]
"You already guessed I would act, so is this thanks really necessary?" [[7380 西格利德 neutral]]
Perhaps due to the influence of her vampire bloodline, Sigrid's tone naturally carried a sense of aloofness and cold detachment. [[7381 旁白 neutral]]
She wasn't a fool. Although she didn't possess the "absolute knowledge" ability of the Wind Saintess, based on keywords like the witch's prophecy and never being deceived by lies, she could probably deduce that the Wind Saintess, who inherited their ancestor's dramatic flair, must have included her in her scheme and plans. [[7382 旁白 neutral]]
Otherwise, sending herself out so naively would be too risky. But if there was an undetected Saintess on the battlefield to provide support, the situation would be entirely different. [[7383 旁白 neutral]]
"My apologies, I had to borrow your strength." [[7384 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
"You don't need to apologize for that. After all, it was my initiative, wasn't it?" [[7385 西格利德 neutral]]
"I trust your noble character, even though this is our first meeting, respected Water Saintess." [[7386 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
Celeste's tone was extremely respectful, and she humbled herself greatly. [[7387 旁白 neutral]]
"Forget it. Your Windermere clan is best at sophistry. Further talk is useless. You'd best hurry over and help solve this problem." [[7388 西格利德 angry]]
Sigrid waved her hand impatiently, but her gaze happened to catch Vlad, who was recovering from his pain. [[7389 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems the Duke was just taking a halftime break. Good, you have the strength to stand again?" [[7390 西格利德 neutral]]
Vlad clutched his brain, where intense tearing pain still lingered. His scarlet pupils were filled with grotesque bloodshot veins. [[7391 旁白 sad]]
His soul was wounded; it felt like a large chunk of his flesh had been violently scraped off by a knife, and it was the kind that was difficult to heal. [[7392 旁白 sad]]
His body... Having lived for countless years, he had never felt his body so heavy as he did today, so heavy it was like carrying a coffin full of rotting flesh. Every step, every movement was extremely arduous. [[7393 旁白 sad]]
"Saintesses... two..." [[7394 弗拉德 surprised]]
Even if he still couldn't fully grasp the situation, he now completely understood the true identity of the Heartblood Clan member he had fought so fiercely before. [[7395 旁白 neutral]]
The mysterious Water Sage who suddenly appeared on the battlefield was not a mage from the White Tower at all, but the Water Saintess who had slain Kogasa IX on the Craigmore Wasteland four years ago and then swiftly vanished. [[7396 旁白 neutral]]
He had been entirely focused on how to obtain the Wind Saintess, never imagining that a small Kampf could simultaneously have two Saintesses appear, and at this particular time. [[7397 旁白 surprised]]
"You... plotted against me." [[7398 弗拉德 angry]]
Vlad, his body still swaying, hunched over. His blood aura was unnaturally agitated. [[7399 旁白 neutral]]
"Plot? Not really. I merely happened to be passing by. But since I encountered this, how could I just let other Saintesses be, and not lend a hand?" [[7400 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
