Chapter 65: Interrogation [[3673 旁白 neutral]]
    Tonight, the town was calm, but the church was destined to be restless. [[3674 旁白 neutral]]
    Even though it was late at night, the church was still brightly lit. Sena didn't know when she woke up, she only knew that she was startled awake from her sleep by a heavy banging sound at the door, followed by a series of urgent footsteps. [[3675 旁白 neutral]]
    When she put on her clothes and left her room, preparing to check the source of the sound, she saw several other nun sisters from the opposite room also peeking out or getting dressed. [[3676 旁白 neutral]]
    Everyone was awakened by the sudden commotion of the night. When they arrived at the church hall together, they were stunned speechless by the scene before them— [[3677 旁白 surprised]]
    There was a long trail of blood dragged from outside to inside, crimson blood staining the holy church floor tiles. The strong smell of blood in the air made the nuns, who were witnessing such a bloody scene for the first time,忍不住作呕. [[3678 旁白 fearful]]
    But none of these were the most important. The most important thing was the person currently in the church hall. Sister Isabella seemed to have been up all night, still wearing her black and white nun's habit. She was currently bandaging the wounds of Father Andre, who was leaning back in a chair. [[3679 旁白 neutral]]
    One of the nun sisters suddenly shrieked. Following the direction of her finger, the girls saw another horrifying sight: in the corner of the church hall lay an ugly monster with all four limbs severed, discarded casually. [[3680 旁白 fearful]]
    The nuns instinctively recoiled from the ugly monster and all gathered around Father Andre. In their impression, Father had always been a gentle and respected presence. They never expected Father to be covered in blood and scars tonight, leaning back in a chair. [[3681 旁白 neutral]]
    Some of the more timid nuns even started crying, clinging to Andre's knees, their mouths filled with phrases like "What happened to Father?" and "Don't die." [[3682 旁白 sad]]
    Sena was one of the older nuns, with a relatively mature and steady personality, but even she could only manage not to cry, her pretty face still pale with fright. [[3683 旁白 fearful]]
    "Alright, don't cry like that, looking like weeping willows. Father has only suffered some minor injuries, nothing fatal. If you keep crying like this, you might really soften the Wind God's heart and have him take Father's soul away." [[3684 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    The little nuns gathered around. Isabella, who was bandaging Andre's wounds, was also forced to the center. Feeling the nuns' panic and sadness, she had no choice but to explain. [[3685 旁白 neutral]]
    Although Isabella hadn't been in the church for long, as a buxom woman, she still held considerable authority among the nuns. At least, Sena and the other girls trusted her greatly. [[3686 旁白 neutral]]
    Upon hearing Isabella's words, most of the nuns stopped crying and subconsciously looked at Andre, who was covered in blood. [[3687 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre also, at the right moment, forced a smile onto his face. [[3688 旁白 neutral]]
    "Alright, girls, no need to cry for me. My mission is not yet over, and the Wind God probably wouldn't want to take me yet." [[3689 安德烈 neutral]]
    His slightly relaxed, playful words completely defused the tense atmosphere in the church. The nuns stopped panicking and immediately began to ask questions about what happened tonight, speaking over each other. [[3690 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre thought it best not to tell these timid girls about the fantastical matters, such as a Blood Kin Grand Duke possibly sealed beneath their church, their old man being a werewolf, and the revered Priestess of their town being a witch. Otherwise, hearing such horror story-like truths, they probably wouldn't be able to sleep at night from fright. [[3691 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre didn't want to see a group of nuns with dark circles under their eyes greeting the town residents tomorrow morning. Girls should be young, beautiful, and lovable. [[3692 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella, understanding his intent, also helped Andre explain, using the excuse of detecting a lone vampire's tracks around the town to classify the ugly monster left in the corner as an individual, wild vampire, and assured them that the threat had been completely removed. [[3693 旁白 neutral]]
    "Alright, alright, girls, that's generally what happened. The evil monster has been eliminated, and Father has cleared the danger. It's late now, everyone should go back to their rooms and sleep. You might not be able to get up on time to pray to the Wind God tomorrow." [[3694 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    With Isabella's explanation, the nuns also believed the story and began to return to their rooms in the backyard in twos and threes. As they passed the ugly vampire in the corner, the girls looked at it with either curiosity or disgust. Only Sasha, the last one, mustered up her courage and cautiously approached, then bravely glared at the ugly lump of flesh that was no different from a corpse. [[3695 旁白 neutral]]
    Finally, when Sasha's figure also disappeared into the darkness to rest in her room, Andre, leaning back in his chair, chuckled. [[3696 旁白 neutral]]
    They truly were a group of lovely young girls. So, in the eyes of outsiders, they were nuns serving God, but in reality, they were just a group of young girls, mostly in their prime... [[3697 旁白 neutral]]
    "You're certainly happy, Father. My arm is aching from bandaging you." [[3698 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella's resentful complaint came from beside him again. [[3699 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "How does it feel to be surrounded by young girls, Father?" [[3700 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    With the outsiders gone, Isabella, knowing that Andre's injuries were not serious, was in the mood to tease him. [[3701 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hmm, if Isabella is willing to take on all my daily confession duties, then I'd be happy to be surrounded by young nuns day and night." [[3702 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Father, being greedy will be punished by God, you know~" [[3703 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella uncharacteristically took on the role of the straight man. [[3704 旁白 neutral]]
    "But speaking of which, have you figured things out?" [[3705 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "From the information gathered during the battle, it's pretty much as we guessed. But all of this needs to be confirmed after we pry the definite information from that guy's mouth." [[3706 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre glanced at the ugly lump of flesh in the corner and said. [[3707 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hmm, so is this good news or bad news?" [[3708 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Neither good nor bad, I suppose. But for now, if we hadn't disrupted their plan in advance, the situation would only be worse." [[3709 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre recalled the dark, ugly ghouls that had been released from the carriage. He couldn't imagine how much casualties would be caused in a short time if these ghouls were completely unleashed into the town. [[3710 旁白 fearful]]
    It probably wouldn't be long before the entire peaceful town would turn into a living hell, right? [[3711 旁白 fearful]]
    And those vampires who tried to turn all the town residents into blood slaves—except for the strongest leader, all the others were without exception nailed to the walls by him, dead beyond dead. [[3712 旁白 neutral]]
    "Then what about cleaning up the aftermath and..." [[3713 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "You don't have to worry about that. A few bottles of holy water, and with a gust of wind, you wouldn't even be able to sniff out a single trace even if you brought a hound over." [[3714 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Before the battle, I had already evacuated the nearby residents and set up a silencing barrier. So I believe tonight, apart from a few informed individuals and our church, everyone's sweet dreams weren't disturbed." [[3715 安德烈 neutral]]
    Isabella listened carefully to Andre's meticulous arrangements and couldn't help but value the man before her even more. [[3716 旁白 neutral]]
    Although he was only third-tier, with his abilities and character, he was definitely one of the best candidates she was looking for. [[3717 旁白 neutral]]
    It was a pity that he remained unyielding, and she could only watch such talent without being able to take him away. [[3718 旁白 neutral]]
    "So what are you going to do with that vampire?" [[3719 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "Of course, I'll squeeze out as much remaining value from it as possible and make it spill all the information it knows, not a single bit left." [[3720 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre said without hesitation. [[3721 旁白 neutral]]
    "Just so you know, I'm not good at interrogating war criminals. You'll have to do this dirty work yourself." [[3722 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    Isabella stood up, tidied the used bandages and medicine, and habitually shifted the responsibility, hands on her hips. [[3723 旁白 neutral]]
    "Don't worry, leave this to me. As long as they are demons, I have ways to pry words out of their mouths." [[3724 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre looked at the bloodstains on the ground, sneered twice, his emerald eyes faintly reflecting a subtle, alluring pink that was hard to detect. [[3725 旁白 neutral]]
