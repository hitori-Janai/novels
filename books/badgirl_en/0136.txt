Chapter 136: The One Who Walks with God [[8582 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is it because she walks with God?" [[8583 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Even if Selen An was uneducated before, he was still the young master of a Saintess family. Even without studying, he had heard about the special Saintess of Light through observation – the one who walks with God. [[8584 旁白 neutral]]
    "Yes, Saintesses are called God's chosen agents in the mortal world because divine blood flows within them, allowing them to directly hear divine oracles from God and carry out God's will." [[8585 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina casually set up a small barrier, starting today's first lesson. [[8586 旁白 neutral]]
    "Usually, the divine oracles of the Six Gods are very far apart, often only one descends every ten or eight years. They reside high on their thrones, not interfering too much with the mortal world's operations, only sending guidance when facing a cataclysmic disaster." [[8587 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    She changed her tone, speaking with reverence. [[8588 旁白 neutral]]
    "However, the God of Light is different. Her divine oracles descend frequently, conveying everything from trivial matters to great world-saving deeds. Therefore, the Saintess of Light listens to divine oracles and executes divine will far more often than her peers, as if she walks beside God, hence the name 'the one who walks with God'." [[8589 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Isn't that too painful?" [[8590 塞伦安 sad]]
    Selen An couldn't help but frown. To others, gods were great, sacred, omniscient, and omnipotent beings. But to him, neither righteous gods nor evil gods were good people. [[8591 旁白 neutral]]
    Even the Six Creator Gods, praised by the Church for saving the suffering, and whose mercy and greatness were proclaimed by their followers, still couldn't hide the true nature of gods. Too much contact with gods would only turn one into an increasingly rigid divine puppet. [[8592 旁白 fearful]]
    As Selen An himself would jokingly say: [[8593 旁白 neutral]]
    "Though not close to God, they are already far from humanity." [[8594 塞伦安 neutral]]
    He didn't study much else and couldn't chime in, but on this topic, he had too much to say, because he was a typical example. Look, just a little connection with the God of Water, and the strong physique and masculinity he had cultivated over four years had already been burned to ashes. [[8595 旁白 fearful]]
    Isn't such a great price enough to explain the problem? [[8596 旁白 neutral]]
    This doesn't even count the mystical, uncontrollable "absolute rationality" mode his body entered after Loberia's "Blood Sacrifice" due to being infused with immense divine power. [[8597 旁白 neutral]]
    "Everyone has different views on the changes that occur after contacting gods. Young Master, you may see this change as an arbitrary modification of oneself, a bad thing, but some people always see this change as a gift from God, proof of their evolution towards a higher level of life." [[8598 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina answered as objectively as possible. [[8599 旁白 neutral]]
    "Those people are truly crazy." [[8600 塞伦安 angry]]
    The young man shook his head, completely unable to understand the bizarre thoughts of these people. [[8601 旁白 neutral]]
    This change, to put it nicely, is getting closer to God; to put it harshly, what's the difference between it and the demons' corruption and assimilation? [[8602 塞伦安 angry]]
    "Deification" almost completely erases one's original self, while "demonic corruption" crushes the past self and reshapes a new soul with past memories using it as raw material. [[8603 旁白 neutral]]
    "In short, given your current state, Young Master, it's best to stay away from the Luminaris territory of the Saintess of Light. After all, there, you really might run into the true God of Light, and the God of Light, who symbolizes justice, will absolutely not let go of a Saintess descendant with demon blood flowing through them..." [[8604 塞拉菲娜 fearful]]
    Selen An nodded solemnly. The God of Light, symbolizing miracles and justice, was an even more significant figure. If he encountered Her, Selen An didn't think he could escape safely like he did with the God of Wind. [[8605 旁白 fearful]]
    Moreover, he had a premonition that if he, in Loberia's body, happened to encounter the God of Light or the Saintess of Light, something extremely bad would definitely happen, for example: he would be forever trapped there. [[8606 旁白 fearful]]
    "But Young Master, you don't have to bear too much hostility towards this righteous God. The justice of the God of Light may have a prejudiced side. When dealing with humanity's greatest enemy, the Demon Clan, the forces of the God of Light have always been at the forefront." [[8607 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Of course, I understand that." [[8608 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Seeing Selen An's serious expression, Seraphina nodded slightly. [[8609 旁白 neutral]]
    "Everything has its pros and cons, and so do the gods..." [[8610 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Speaking of combat power, which Saintess can be called the strongest?" [[8611 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Perhaps he had heard too much theory, so Selen An, with a sudden inspiration, immediately steered the conversation towards the combat rankings that men loved most. [[8612 旁白 neutral]]
    "The overall strength of the Saintesses at the same rank is mostly similar. After all, as descendants of gods, excluding a very few exceptions of the same era, there won't be much difference. However, if we're talking purely about combat power..." [[8613 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Actually, I'm not sure either." [[8614 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    The blonde girl smiled helplessly, and Selen An's mouth twitched. [[8615 旁白 neutral]]
    "Looking at how serious you were, I thought you knew everything." [[8616 塞伦安 neutral]]
    "How is that possible? Omniscience and omnipotence are things only gods can achieve. I've only stayed by Miss Celeste's side for a longer time, so I know a bit more about the Saintesses than ordinary people. Each Saintess has her strengths, and differences in combat style, age of succession, and experience will affect the battle situation..." [[8617 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "However, from an objective point of view, historically, among the six Saintesses, the Ice Saintess, Fire Saintess, and Light Saintess are generally the main combatants. These three young women often personally lead their Holy Knight Orders to participate in front-line battles, while the Wind, Rock, and Water Saintesses focus more on maintaining internal stability and and peace within the Empire." [[8618 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Is that so?" [[8619 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Selen An stroked his chin and nodded to himself. [[8620 旁白 neutral]]
    "Then let's stay away from the Ice, Fire, and Light Saintesses in the future. After all, I'm not good at fighting and killing." [[8621 塞伦安 neutral]]
    "Really?" [[8622 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
    The blonde girl gave the young man, who wanted to stay out of trouble, a deep look, her tone noncommittal. [[8623 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hey, why are you looking at me like that? Isn't it true?" [[8624 塞伦安 angry]]
    "My ideal is to be an approachable priest, helping and guiding people when they encounter difficulties or feel lost. This aligns perfectly with my ideals and goals." [[8625 塞伦安 neutral]]
    The young man pouted, still stubborn. [[8626 旁白 neutral]]
    "With your looks, Young Master, I think you'd be more suited to try being a nun than a priest. If Young Master wore a nun's habit, I think that image would be more popular with believers than a priest's." [[8627 塞拉菲娜 happy]]
    "Seraphina, you!" [[8628 塞伦安 angry]]
    Selen An was about to get angry. Just as he was about to argue with this former Holy Nun who always undermined him, the carriage suddenly braked sharply, causing the young man, who was sitting steadily inside, to lose his balance and lunge directly into the arms of the girl opposite him. [[8629 旁白 surprised]]
    Damn it! Can the coachman drive? What happened? [[8630 塞伦安 angry]]
    These two thoughts had just flashed through Selen An's mind when he was completely overwhelmed by the softness that came at him, only able to make muffled sounds. [[8631 旁白 surprised]]
    Outside the carriage, there was a commotion, seemingly with shouting. [[8632 旁白 neutral]]
    The coachman, who was originally driving, was trembling like a sieve, his hands holding the reins shaking uncontrollably. [[8633 旁白 fearful]]
    "It's, it's wandering mercenaries!" [[8634 陌生男1 fearful]]
    Figures, approaching in small groups from all directions, carried faint killing intent, and their equipment was mismatched. This was a typical characteristic of wandering mercenaries. [[8635 旁白 neutral]]
    He shouted tremblingly, and as if he thought of something, he didn't even say hello to the back of the carriage. The coachman directly jumped off the driver's seat and ran wildly towards a less crowded place. [[8636 旁白 fearful]]
    Since the carriage was already targeted, a single-horse carriage naturally couldn't escape the encirclement of these experienced wandering mercenaries. These mercenaries, who lived by the sword, usually robbed for money. Abandoning the carriage and its occupants to escape might offer a glimmer of hope. [[8637 旁白 neutral]]
    The coachman ran desperately with this thought, but unfortunately, behind him, a longbow was fully drawn with an arrow aimed at his figure. [[8638 旁白 neutral]]
    "Whoosh!" [[8639 旁白 neutral]]
    A sharp arrow flew through the air, and just as it was about to hit the coachman's back, a cold gleam shot out from inside the carriage, coincidentally hitting the flying arrow. With a brief clang of metal, the arrow was broken in mid-air by that light. [[8640 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing this, the mercenaries wanted to chase again, but they were stopped by a burly man in armor. [[8641 旁白 neutral]]
    "Wait, he's just a scared coachman. He probably doesn't have much money. The real value is inside the carriage. And this time, it seems we've run into quite a prize." [[8642 陌生男1 neutral]]
    The wandering mercenary group surrounded the small carriage, leaving no room for escape. Under the gaze of dozens of eyes, the carriage door slowly opened, and a tall, beautiful young woman stepped out, with flowing golden hair and calm blue eyes. [[8643 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ohh~ Looks like a noble lady." [[8644 陌生男2 happy]]
    A short man standing beside the burly man who had given the order earlier exclaimed, and his small eyes immediately glowed with greed. [[8645 旁白 neutral]]
    Originally, they just wanted to rob for money, but they didn't expect a buy one get one free deal. This time, they couldn't help but also go for 'that'. [[8646 旁白 neutral]]
    The burly man nodded. Just as he was about to wave his hand, signaling his subordinates to rush forward and take her down, the young, beautiful lady who had stepped out with an extraordinary demeanor earlier walked to the side of the carriage door and bowed, making a gesture to invite someone out— [[8647 旁白 neutral]]
    To everyone's surprise, a young master, dressed in a coat, with a slender figure and delicate skin, stepped out, stood firm, and casually adjusted the collar of his clothes, as if completely unaware of the danger he was in. [[8648 旁白 neutral]]
    "Boss, I didn't expect the one who got off earlier to be a maid. The young master behind her is the real prize. This young master also looks fair-skinned, delicate, and tender. How about we take them both down later? The woman for you, Boss, and the man for the brothers..." [[8649 陌生男2 happy]]
    The short man approached the burly man, rubbed his hands, and expressed his opinion in a flattering tone, but to his surprise, he once again received a negative decision from his boss. [[8650 旁白 neutral]]
    The short man was first surprised, then instantly understood that he was still too naive. How could there be a choice between two such things? Don't adults want both? [[8651 旁白 neutral]]
    So... [[8652 旁白 neutral]]
    "Tonight, clean up that young master and send him to my room. As for the woman, you can do whatever you want with her." [[8653 陌生男1 neutral]]
    "?" [[8654 陌生男2 surprised]]
    The short man's eyes suddenly widened, as if he had heard something unbelievable. [[8655 旁白 surprised]]
    At the same time, he also understood something. No wonder the boss had robbed many beautiful young women over the years, but most of them were thrown into black markets or slave markets. So it turned out... [[8656 旁白 surprised]]
    Selen An, who was still more than ten meters away, heard these words clearly and completely due to his body's enhancement. The young man's mouth twitched violently, and his hands unconsciously clenched into fists. [[8657 旁白 angry]]
    Holy crap! He's already in another world, and he can still witness such a dramatic turn of events! [[8658 塞伦安 angry]]
    The key is that the "main character" of this drama is himself! [[8659 塞伦安 angry]]
    Selen An, who had originally planned to show his image as a compassionate priest after getting out of the carriage, immediately changed his mind. However, a priest's compassion is only for the simple folk; a priest's wrath should be directed at these utterly evil villains! [[8660 旁白 angry]]
    Just as Seraphina was about to pull out her usual crescent-shaped dagger from under her skirt, her searching arm was pressed down by Selen An. The girl was puzzled, but then she heard the young man's low whisper in her ear. [[8661 旁白 neutral]]
    "You don't need to act. Watch the carriage. These people are mine." [[8662 塞伦安 neutral]]
    It's time to let these people experience the "great love" of the Gunblade Priest! [[8663 塞伦安 angry]]
    Selen An gently flicked his wrist, and a pair of gunblades slid out from his sleeves. The young man skillfully grasped the hilts, lowered his head slightly, and slowly walked towards the burly man. [[8664 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh ho~ This young master not only doesn't surrender but dares to walk towards us! Boss!" [[8665 陌生男2 happy]]
    The short man had just gestured when he heard a clear "slurp" sound by his ear. He turned his head and saw the burly man staring intensely at the approaching white-clad youth with fiery eyes, his heart restless, unable to resist licking his lips. [[8666 旁白 neutral]]
    "Good, I like conquering wild horses like him. The more he resists, the more excited I get." [[8667 陌生男1 happy]]
    The husky whisper, filled with desire, made even the short man tremble. He didn't expect his boss to be so perverted in private, but what did that have to do with him? [[8668 旁白 surprised]]
    His own ass wasn't going to be "blossoming" tonight. As long as those two were captured, he could enjoy the taste of that maid— [[8669 陌生男2 happy]]
    A maid who looked so refined and clearly came from a prominent family was completely incomparable to ordinary maids. Today, he could finally taste some high-class goods! [[8670 陌生男2 happy]]
    Most of the other wandering mercenaries also had similar thoughts. With a wave of the burly man's hand, these mercenaries with various equipment rushed forward, their greedy and unconcealed eyes seemingly afraid of being too slow and missing out on their share. [[8671 旁白 neutral]]
    In their eyes, Selen An and Seraphina, abandoned by the coachman, were lambs to be slaughtered. But the white-clad priest walking towards them in reverse was filled with "ardent love," intending to send them to hell. [[8672 旁白 angry]]
    What about "Forgiveness is God's job, sending you to God is my job?" [[8673 旁白 angry]]
    You angered the priest and still want to go to heaven? [[8674 旁白 angry]]
    Eat sh*t! Villains only deserve to go to hell! [[8675 塞伦安 angry]]
    The gunblades, forged from the bones of a wolf king, formed the shape of a cross of judgment in the priest's hands. The blades rubbed against each other, emitting a chilling tremor! [[8676 旁白 neutral]]
    "Amen!" [[8677 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Selen An's figure lunged forward like a phantom, the gunblades cutting out a chilling silver light. The short man, who bore the brunt, felt a chill in his throat, his greedy expression frozen on his face, and blood spurted out. [[8678 旁白 fearful]]
    The mercenaries were horrified, their charge halted abruptly. [[8679 旁白 fearful]]
    "Desecrator!" [[8680 塞伦安 angry]]
    Selen An's voice was cold as iron, carrying the majesty of judgment. His wrists flicked, the gunblades' tremor suddenly sharpened, like a death knell ringing, their tips pointing directly at the burly man whose face changed drastically. The priest's eyes burned not with anger, but with pure, cold judgment. [[8681 旁白 angry]]
    "Your head, I shall take it on behalf of God!" [[8682 塞伦安 angry]]
