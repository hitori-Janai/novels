Chapter 1: Reset 1: I Don't Want to Be Corrupted! [[1 旁白 neutral]]
    “Ugh…!” [[2 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Pain, as if his body was being torn apart. [[3 旁白 fearful]]
    The young man opened his eyes amidst the unbearable agony, his index fingers uncontrollably clawing at his face. The piercing itch and severe pain felt as if they could only be relieved by tearing off his skin. [[4 旁白 fearful]]
    The edges of his vision were tinged with bloody red, and bones grew uncontrollably amidst the itching and pain. Beneath his originally fair skin, sinister purple veins appeared, making his skin's original color turn into an alien purple... [[5 旁白 fearful]]
    It was as if horns were pushing out from both sides of his forehead, and the small carriage was filled with the aura of desire. [[6 旁白 fearful]]
    Something was also growing out of the end of his tailbone, breaking through the limits of flesh and blood. His body felt like it was submerged in boiling water. Overwhelmed by the unbearable heat, he instinctively slammed his head against the wooden wall of the carriage. [[7 旁白 fearful]]
    “Thud!” [[8 旁白 neutral]]
    This sudden crashing sound attracted the attention of the people outside the moving carriage. [[9 旁白 neutral]]
    “What’s going on? Why is there a banging sound inside the carriage?” [[10 陌生男1 surprised]]
    “Is something wrong with the Young Master? Go check quickly!” [[11 陌生男2 surprised]]
    Two deep male voices rang out from outside the carriage, followed by footsteps. Just as the footsteps approached the carriage door, which was about to be opened, another voice suddenly cut in. [[12 旁白 neutral]]
    “What are you doing? Who told you to stop?! Don't you know the Ice's minions are about to catch up? Are you trying to kill the Young Master? Hurry up and drive at full speed!” [[13 玛拉 angry]]
    A series of questions seemed to stun the two men outside the carriage. The stopped carriage slowly began to move again. [[14 旁白 neutral]]
    That voice also seemed strangely familiar. [[15 旁白 neutral]]
    The young man, leaning his head against the wooden carriage wall, gasped heavily. Large beads of sweat rolled down his slightly effeminate cheeks, and even his breathing became unusually soft, unlike a man's. [[16 旁白 neutral]]
    As soon as the three voices began conversing, the pain and heat within him suddenly subsided. The strange sensation of bones breaking through flesh gradually disappeared, but after being tormented like this upon waking, he was now exhausted. [[17 旁白 neutral]]
    His chaotic mind was too weak to think about more things; he could only observe the unfamiliar surroundings as much as possible. So, what was this...? [[18 旁白 surprised]]
    “Creak~” [[19 旁白 neutral]]
    The wooden door of the carriage opened, and a figure walked in. [[20 旁白 neutral]]
    The young man weakly lifted his head, only to see a woman appear before him. Her face was withered and old, and she wore a white nun's habit different from ordinary nuns. And that face... [[21 旁白 neutral]]
    The young man's pupils reflected the old nun's face, and he instinctively frowned. At the same time, the old nun who had entered the carriage spoke. [[22 旁白 neutral]]
    “Master Selen An, don't you worry. Even if I have to give up my old life, I, Mara, will ensure your safety.” [[23 玛拉 neutral]]
    If the old nun hadn't spoken, the young man would have only found her face strangely familiar. But with her voice, combined with her self-proclamation as Mara and her addressing him as Selen An, this sense of familiarity became extraordinarily strong! [[24 旁白 surprised]]
    No way, it can't be such a coincidence, right? [[25 塞伦安 surprised]]
    He had just stayed up all night playing an 18+ "healthy" game called "Six Saints' Lament: Dawn's Bond." When he got excited, he felt something stir in his pants and reached down to adjust himself. Suddenly, he felt a palpitation, his vision went dark, and he lost consciousness... [[26 旁白 neutral]]
    When he woke up again, he suffered tearing pain throughout his body. Then he heard that conversation and saw the nun named Mara before him. [[27 旁白 neutral]]
    Mara, isn't that the alias of the demon spy in the Winterlein Family? [[28 塞伦安 surprised]]
    Knowing the game's plot well, this thought immediately popped into his head. And this old nun before him called him Selen An, a name of even greater significance. [[29 塞伦安 surprised]]
    Selen An's full name was Selen An Winterlein, the last direct descendant of a family that inherited the Water Saintess's bloodline in the game. As is well-known, in such 18+ "healthy" games, anyone involved with a Saintess would have a very "exciting" ending, and Selen An was no exception, even though he was a man. [[30 旁白 neutral]]
    In the plot, due to his status, Selen An had developed an arrogant and domineering personality since childhood, embodying the typical image of a profligate scion who had committed countless misdeeds. [[31 旁白 neutral]]
    Logically, this character design would be a typical villainous cannon fodder male supporting character, a stepping stone for the protagonist in other normal games. In an adult game, he would become a "perpetrator" who acted wildly and did whatever he pleased. But this game was different... [[32 旁白 neutral]]
    The profligate scion named Selen An, in order to awaken the bloodline within him and gain power that would allow him to act even more recklessly, was foolish enough to collude with and trust the Demon Clan, who were generations-long enemies of the Saintess family. As for his ending, for a male character, it was considered more tragic than death. [[33 旁白 fearful]]
    He was framed by the Demons and implanted with a Succubus Seed. Under the dual pressure of being assassinated by his childhood friend, Serenia Glacies, the Ice Saintess who was fulfilling a Divine Oracle, and the Demon cavalry, he completely broke down. His noble Saintess bloodline was tainted by the Succubus Seed, his spirit and soul were severely twisted, and he degenerated into a "shameless" female Succubus under the watchful eyes of his childhood friend and the Demons. [[34 旁白 fearful]]
    As for the one who framed him and planted the Succubus Seed within him, it was none other than the governess-nun named Mara, who was currently before him. Her true identity was a demon spy planted by the Demon Clan within the Winterlein Family! [[35 旁白 fearful]]
    So, so... so he really transmigrated into an adult game! [[36 塞伦安 surprised]]
    And he became a profligate scion who was about to be corrupted into a female Succubus! [[37 塞伦安 fearful]]
    As the young man was thinking this, he suddenly felt a cool touch on his forehead. There was still a bump that hadn't subsided, and the old nun's sinister voice came from his ear. [[38 旁白 neutral]]
    “Don’t be afraid, Young Master. All these changes in your body are normal phenomena. Don’t resist it, accept it, embrace it. As long as you shake off Princess Serenia behind you and escape to Craigmore...” [[39 玛拉 neutral]]
    “There, Young Master, with the help of the Demon Lord, you will surely awaken the power within you and usher in a second rebirth!” [[40 玛拉 happy]]
    Perhaps the original Selen An in the plot was too foolish and dull, or perhaps he had already been scared witless by the situation at that time and didn't notice. [[41 旁白 neutral]]
    In any case, the young man who had transmigrated here could clearly feel the strange fanaticism and suppressed excitement in Mara's voice when she said those two sentences. [[42 旁白 neutral]]
    Excited? Excited about what? [[43 塞伦安 surprised]]
    Was she excited that he, the sole direct descendant with the purest bloodline of the Water Saintess, was about to degenerate into a shameless, desire-driven Succubus under the gaze of the Demons? [[44 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Selen An felt a deep chill! [[45 塞伦安 fearful]]
    This kind of TSF plot might make players feel inexplicably excited in an adult game, but if it became reality now, and he was the protagonist of such a plot, all he could feel was the production team's deep malicious intent and goosebumps all over his body. [[46 塞伦安 fearful]]
    What to do? What to do? [[47 塞伦安 fearful]]
    If the original plot continued, he would escape by carriage to Craigmore. There, Serenia Glacies, the Ice Saintess, who was fulfilling the Divine Oracle to assassinate him, would seize the opportunity, catch up to him, hold the Sword of Judgment to his neck, and listen to his last words. [[48 旁白 fearful]]
    And the Demon army, having received the signal, would quickly surround them both. Under such dual pressure, even if he could withstand the mental strain and not collapse into corruption, what then? [[49 旁白 fearful]]
    In that situation, he seemed to have only two choices: either beg Serenia for a quick death, a sword across his throat – in the game's設定, he and Serenia had a strained childhood friend relationship, so he believed she would grant him this favor. [[50 塞伦安 fearful]]
    But slitting his throat would be very painful. The feeling of blood slowly draining from his body, his limbs gradually turning cold, his vision blurring, and slowly being enveloped by the shadow of death—just thinking about it would make him wet his pants! [[51 塞伦安 fearful]]
    But if he didn't want to die and was caught by the Demon army, those inhumane Demons had countless ways to accelerate the Succubus Seed within him. Once he truly degenerated, he wouldn't even count as human anymore! [[52 塞伦安 fearful]]
    More importantly, in this game's setting, once a human degenerates into a demon, their soul becomes severely polluted and twisted. By then, the soul controlling that Succubus body would no longer be his original self! [[53 旁白 fearful]]
    He would completely transform into a monster, both physically and mentally. So, there was no such thing as "enjoying becoming a Succubus" or "spreading your legs for pleasure" as some netizens claimed... [[54 旁白 fearful]]
    This ending was no different from death... No, it was even more tragic and humiliating than death! [[55 塞伦安 fearful]]
    What the hell is this?! [[56 塞伦安 angry]]
    So, how am I supposed to play with this kind of disastrous start?! [[57 塞伦安 angry]]
    P.S.: New author here, writing a new book isn't easy. If you think this topic is good, please favorite it. Thanks for your support. [[58 旁白 neutral]]
