Chapter 1, Reset 1: I Don't Want to Be Corrupted! [[1 旁白 fearful]]
"Ugh...!" [[2 塞伦安 sad]]
Pain, as if his body was being torn apart. [[3 旁白 fearful]]
The young man opened his eyes in agony, his fingers uncontrollably clawing at his face. It felt like the only way to stop the piercing itch and pain was to rip his own skin off. [[4 旁白 fearful]]
The edges of his vision turned a bloody red. His bones grew uncontrollably amid an itching and painful sensation. Under his once-fair skin, hideous purple veins appeared, turning his skin an unnatural shade of purple... [[5 旁白 fearful]]
It felt as if horns were about to push out from his forehead. The small carriage filled with an air of desire. [[6 旁白 fearful]]
Something felt like it was about to burst from the end of his tailbone. His body felt like it was soaking in boiling water. Overwhelmed by the heat, he instinctively slammed his head against the wooden carriage wall. [[7 旁白 fearful]]
"Thud!" [[8 旁白 neutral]]
The sudden sound of impact drew the attention of the people outside the moving carriage. [[9 旁白 neutral]]
"What's happening? Why is there a banging sound coming from the carriage?" [[10 陌生男1 surprised]]
"Is something wrong with the Young Master? You should go check!" [[11 陌生男2 surprised]]
Two deep male voices spoke outside the carriage, followed by footsteps. Just as the steps got closer and the door was about to be opened, another voice suddenly interrupted. [[12 旁白 neutral]]
"What are you doing? Who told you to stop?! Don't you know the Ice Saintess's minions are about to catch us? Are you trying to get the Young Master killed? Get moving, full speed!" [[13 玛拉 angry]]
The sharp questions seemed to stun the two men outside. The carriage, which had stopped, slowly began to move again. [[14 旁白 neutral]]
That voice sounded strangely familiar. [[15 旁白 neutral]]
Leaning his head against the wooden wall, the young man gasped for air. Sweat streamed down his delicate face, and even his breaths sounded soft, not like a man's. [[16 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as the three voices spoke, the pain and heat in his body suddenly eased. The strange feeling of bones breaking through his flesh also faded away. But after being tormented like this right after waking up, he was now exhausted. [[17 旁白 neutral]]
His confused mind couldn't think about much else. He just tried to observe his strange surroundings. So... where was he? [[18 旁白 surprised]]
"Creaak~" [[19 旁白 neutral]]
The wooden door of the carriage opened, and a figure walked in. [[20 旁白 neutral]]
The young man managed to lift his head and saw a woman before him. Her face was old and withered, and she wore a white nun's habit, different from a normal one. And that face... [[21 旁白 neutral]]
As the old nun's face was reflected in the young man's eyes, he subconsciously frowned. At the same time, the old nun who had entered the carriage spoke. [[22 旁白 neutral]]
"Master Selen An, don't you worry. Even if I have to give up my old life, I, Mara, will ensure your safety." [[23 玛拉 neutral]]
It would have been better if the old nun hadn't spoken. The young man had only found her face vaguely familiar, but with her voice, her calling herself Mara, and calling him Selen An, the sense of familiarity was now overwhelming! [[24 旁白 surprised]]
No way, it can't be such a coincidence, can it? [[25 塞伦安 surprised]]
He had just been playing an 18+ "healthy" game called "Six Saints' Lament: Dawn's Bond" all night. At an exciting part, he felt something move in his pants and reached down to adjust it, but then his heart fluttered, his vision went black, and he lost consciousness... [[26 旁白 neutral]]
When he woke up again, he was hit by a pain like his body was being torn apart, then he heard that conversation and saw the nun named Mara before him. [[27 旁白 neutral]]
Mara, isn't that the alias of the Demon Clan's spy in the Winterlein family? [[28 塞伦安 surprised]]
Knowing the game's plot, this thought immediately popped into his head. And this old nun called him Selen An, a name that was even more significant. [[29 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An's full name was Selen An Winterlein, the last direct descendant of the family that inherited the blood of the Water Saintess in the game. And as everyone knows, in this kind of 18+ healthy game, any character related to a saintess would have a very... "exciting" end, even if Selen An was a man. [[30 旁白 neutral]]
In the story, Selen An's status had led him to develop an arrogant and domineering personality from a young age, a typical spoiled villain who had done countless bad things. [[31 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, a character like this in a more standard game would be a typical villainous cannon fodder for the protagonist. But in an adult game, he would become the "aggressor" who could do whatever he wanted. But this game was different... [[32 旁白 neutral]]
In order to awaken the bloodline within him and gain power that would let him be even more unrestrained, the spoiled villain named Selen An was foolish enough to collude with and trust the Demon Clan, the mortal enemies of the Saintess's family. As for the ending, for a male character, it was more tragic than death. [[33 旁白 sad]]
He was framed by the demons and implanted with a Succubus Seed. Under the dual pressure of being assassinated by his childhood friend, the Ice Saintess, who was fulfilling a divine oracle, and the demon cavalry, he completely broke down. His noble saintess bloodline was tainted by the Succubus Seed, his spirit and soul were severely twisted, and he degenerated into a "shameless" female succubus under the watch of his friend and the demons. [[34 旁白 fearful]]
And the one who framed him, who implanted the Succubus Seed in him, was this very governess nun named Mara. Her true identity was a demon spy planted in the Winterlein family! [[35 旁白 fearful]]
So, so... so I've really been transported into an adult game! [[36 塞伦安 fearful]]
And I've become a spoiled villain who is about to be corrupted into a female succubus! [[37 塞伦安 fearful]]
As this thought raced through the young man's mind, he suddenly felt a cold touch on his forehead, where a bump had not yet faded. The old nun's dark voice whispered in his ear. [[38 旁白 fearful]]
"Don't be afraid, Young Master. These changes in your body are all normal. Don't resist them. Accept them, embrace them. As long as we shake off Princess Serenia behind us and escape to Craigmore..." [[39 玛拉 neutral]]
"There, Young Master, with the Demon Lord's help, you will surely awaken the power within you and be reborn!" [[40 玛拉 happy]]
Perhaps the original Selen An in the story was too foolish, too slow, or perhaps he was too frightened by the situation to notice. [[41 旁白 neutral]]
But now, the young man who had transmigrated into this body could clearly feel the strange fervor and suppressed excitement in Mara's voice as she spoke. [[42 旁白 surprised]]
Excitement? What was she excited about? [[43 塞伦安 angry]]
Was she excited that the sole direct heir with the purest blood of the Water Saintess was about to degenerate into a shameless, desire-craving succubus under the watch of all the demons? [[44 塞伦安 angry]]
Selen An felt a deep chill! [[45 塞伦安 fearful]]
This kind of TSF plot might be strangely exciting for players in an adult game, but if it became reality, and he was the main character, all he could feel was the developers' twisted sense of humor and goosebumps all over his body. [[46 塞伦安 fearful]]
What should I do? What should I do? [[47 塞伦安 fearful]]
If the story unfolds as it originally did, I'll escape to the Craigmore wasteland in a carriage, where the Ice Saintess, Serenia, fulfilling her divine oracle to assassinate me, will catch up to me. She'll hold the Sword of Judgment to my neck and listen to my last words. [[48 旁白 fearful]]
And the demon army, having received their own message, will quickly surround us. Under that double pressure, even if I could withstand the mental stress and not break down and corrupt, what then? [[49 旁白 fearful]]
At that point, it seems I'd only have two choices. Either I beg Serenia to give me a quick death and slit my throat. In the game's story, she and I were childhood friends, so I believe she would do me that favor. [[50 旁白 fearful]]
But getting your throat cut would be so painful. The feeling of blood slowly draining from your body, growing cold, your vision blurring, gradually being enveloped by the shadow of death... just thinking about it is enough to make you wet your pants! [[51 塞伦安 fearful]]
But if I don't want to die and get caught by the demon army, those inhuman demons have plenty of ways to accelerate the Succubus Seed inside me. When I truly degenerate, I won't even be human anymore! [[52 塞伦安 fearful]]
More importantly, in this game's setting, once a human degenerates into a demon, their soul becomes severely polluted and twisted. The soul controlling this succubus body wouldn't even be my original self anymore! [[53 塞伦安 fearful]]
It's like becoming a monster completely, both in body and soul. So there's no such thing as what people online say about "just enjoy it if you become a succubus, spread your legs and have fun..." [[54 塞伦安 fearful]]
That ending is no different from... no, it's more tragic and humiliating than death! [[55 塞伦安 angry]]
This is such a scam! [[56 塞伦安 angry]]
So how am I supposed to play this impossible starting situation?! [[57 塞伦安 fearful]]
