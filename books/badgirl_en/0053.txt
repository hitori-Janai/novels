Chapter 53: A Divine Epic [[3046 旁白 neutral]]
After a busy morning, as noon approached, the clergy inside the church finally got a moment of rest. [[3047 旁白 neutral]]
After lunch, a few young nuns, with Isabella's permission, returned to their rooms to either nap or pray and meditate. Only Lobelia, after clearing the table, went straight up to the church's second floor. [[3048 旁白 neutral]]
Kempfa's church was small but had everything it needed. The ground floor was for daily religious activities, while the second floor housed a small library modeled after the Roland Cathedral. [[3049 旁白 neutral]]
Lobelia climbed the ladder to the library, and an idle Isabella followed close behind. [[3050 旁白 neutral]]
After a full meal, people often feel a bit drowsy. Some would choose to nap at this time, but Lobelia wanted to seize this precious break to read more. After all, when the afternoon work hours began, she would have to attend to an endless stream of town residents again. [[3051 旁白 neutral]]
The church's library was tiny, and the number of books wasn't large. During his four years living in the town, Andre had already read every book in it. But as Lobelia, she felt a strange sense of novelty toward these books she had already read. [[3052 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if reading the same book with a different body brought new insights. [[3053 旁白 neutral]]
Take the book in her hands, "Apocalypse of the Gods." The title sounded grand, as if it recorded some world-shaking divine oracle. But when Andre had skimmed through it, he had scoffed and put it back on the shelf. [[3054 旁白 neutral]]
"Apocalypse of the Gods"? What a joke. The contents were just a pile of the most unreliable history imaginable, probably written by some faithless, reckless author. It claimed the Ice God had an unhealthy need to control the Water God, that the righteous Light God had repeatedly confessed his love for the Water God, and even more ridiculously, it stated in black and white that the Fire God, symbol of war and glory, had courted the Rock God, symbol of ages and protection. The two goddesses even had a forbidden yuri romance... [[3055 旁白 neutral]]
In Andre's eyes, such claims were absurd. Never mind how the Fire God, a battle maniac, could fall for the quiet Rock God—their powers were natural enemies. Besides... [[3056 旁白 neutral]]
The Nephalem Continent was the prototype for an 18+ H-game in his past life. If he hadn't changed some of the plot and hidden away in this remote town, he'd probably be taking on several trolls in some dark cave right now! [[3057 旁白 neutral]]
In a story built on sex and violence, a pure yuri romance was completely illogical! [[3058 旁白 neutral]]
In any other Saintess's territory, this book would be banned for blasphemy. Only in the liberal lands of the Wind God could you find such nonsense in a church library. [[3059 旁白 neutral]]
But this book, which Andre considered worthless, had Lobelia completely absorbed. Looking at it, she felt an unexplainable sense of nostalgia... [[3060 旁白 neutral]]
It was like an adult finding an old photo album in a storage box, opening it, and seeing the yellowed pictures, feeling a heart full of nostalgia for the past. [[3061 旁白 neutral]]
The blasphemous words written in the book felt like a diary she had written herself, filled with the warmth and emotion of time, without a single false statement. [[3062 旁白 neutral]]
As she read, the corners of her mouth curved up slightly, a small change that Isabella noticed. [[3063 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems you really like stories about the gods, little Evelyn~" [[3064 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
The blue-haired girl looked up from her book at the sound of the voice. [[3065 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes. Stories about the gods have a sense of ancient epic to them. Through the words in the book, we can understand them more deeply. It feels like the gods are no longer high and untouchable beings, but are sometimes like us, with the same joys and sorrows... like people." [[3066 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia paused at the end but still said the word. [[3067 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah~ You're so naive, little Evelyn. I've read this book. The author isn't even named. It's clearly full of unreliable stories and fabrications, with very little truth to it." [[3068 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
Isabella giggled, covering her mouth. [[3069 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
"But I just have this strange feeling that the contents of this book are real, not just made up." [[3070 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia carefully placed the bookmark where she had stopped reading and folded her hands on the book's cover. [[3071 旁白 neutral]]
"That's because you haven't read better books, little Evelyn. If you had been to the former royal library in Nord, you would understand what a true treasure trove is, what it means to have a castle filled with books!" [[3072 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
"The library here in Kempfa can't even compare. If you had to, it's probably not much bigger than the royal library's storage room." [[3073 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Here we go again. Whenever Isabella started describing the wonders outside Kempfa, Lobelia knew she was trying to make her yearn for the outside world. [[3074 旁白 neutral]]
This wasn't the first time. Ever since Isabella had seen Evelyn's potential, she had not only grown very fond of her but also frequently dropped hints about the grand cathedrals, especially the Wind God's Cathedral in Nord. [[3075 旁白 neutral]]
Even if Isabella didn't say it directly, Lobelia knew that Nord was the heart of the Windermere territory, and the Wind God's Cathedral there was home to one of the Church's six current saintesses—the Wind Saintess. [[3076 旁白 neutral]]
"Is that so? I'd love to see it for myself one day..." [[3077 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The girl hugged the book to her chest, her voice full of longing for the outside world. [[3078 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella's eyes lit up with excitement, and just as she was about to press her advantage, the girl's next words followed. [[3079 旁白 neutral]]
"But I still prefer Kempfa. The townspeople here are very friendly, and in the church, we have Father Andre and you, Sister Isabella, to protect us. The other sisters also tell me interesting stories about the town's past..." [[3080 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
As Lobelia spoke, her eyes were as calm as still water, and her voice was as pleasant as a singing bird. It was impossible to interrupt her as she spoke so earnestly. [[3081 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella's expression grew complicated as she listened, and finally, she could only sigh in resignation and slump onto the table. [[3082 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
"Sigh... why are you just like Andre? So unwilling to leave this town?" [[3083 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
"Then why do you always want to leave, Sister Isabella? Is it not nice here?" [[3084 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia tilted her head and asked, her voice innocent, without a trace of aggression. [[3085 旁白 neutral]]
"I..." [[3086 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
The gray-haired nun's expression became even more conflicted. She seemed stumped by the girl's simple question, at a loss for words. [[3087 旁白 neutral]]
"Hah, forget it. I was too hasty. It's nice here, little Evelyn. Just pretend I was talking nonsense." [[3088 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
