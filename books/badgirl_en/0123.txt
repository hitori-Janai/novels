Chapter 123: Wind Cleansing [[7311 旁白 neutral]]
    "Come on, let's make a bet." [[7312 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    "My life is already short like a mayfly because of this curse. No matter which side of your demon race targets me, it won't get any worse..." [[7313 塞莱斯特 sad]]
    "Don't run away, proud Archduke. Aren't you going to marry me? If so, why do you fear me, your bride?" [[7314 塞莱斯特 angry]]
    The mental world was collapsing. The scarlet blood moon, which had dominated the night, was falling with earth-shattering force, like the great sun shot down by a divine arrow in legends. [[7315 旁白 fearful]]
    Undoubtedly, the Embrace ceremony was severely damaged from the outside. The spiritual space used to baptize souls was continuously collapsing like a deflated ball. If one stayed here and couldn't leave in time, they would be crushed into pieces by this destructive force. [[7316 旁白 fearful]]
    Vlad stared intently at the calm-faced green-haired girl before him, the anger burning in his heart almost making him grind his teeth. [[7317 旁白 angry]]
    Just retreat empty-handed and disgraced? [[7318 弗拉德 angry]]
    What a joke! He had put in so much effort and thought, only to be mocked face-to-face by a little girl who hadn't even fully grown yet? [[7319 弗拉德 angry]]
    "Very well, since you're so eager to hasten your destiny, I'll grant your wish!" [[7320 弗拉德 angry]]
    Finally, Vlad cast aside all his worries, and eerie blood-red flames ignited on his skin. [[7321 旁白 neutral]]
    Since the Wind Saintess was willing to risk everything and would rather die than surrender to him, there was no need for mercy. Anyway, the Saintess's body was already no different from a blood kin. If Celeste sought death, he would help her along, completely devouring her soul here! [[7322 旁白 angry]]
    By then, Celeste would no longer be his bride but another one of his identities. [[7323 旁白 neutral]]
    With the aid of a fifth-tier Saintess's body, the minor difficulties he faced outside would also be easily resolved. [[7324 旁白 neutral]]
    "Then, please obediently become a part of my body!" [[7325 弗拉德 angry]]
    With Vlad's roar, sharp claws tore through the flesh of his arms, and viscous blood continuously flowed to the ground. Each drop of blood seemed to have a mind of its own, surging and converging, beginning to occupy and compress all space in the form of a river of blood. [[7326 旁白 fearful]]
    In the surging river of blood, there were beast-like roars, and uncorrupted corpses crawled out of the blood. Although the skin color and appearance of these corpses varied, they all had a unified red glow in their eyes. [[7327 旁白 fearful]]
    In the dense eyes hidden by Celeste, there was no sign of reason. What drove these long-dead living corpses was the instinct and obsession of monsters. [[7328 旁白 fearful]]
    "Hahahaha... feel despair, Wind Saintess! Your determination and perseverance impress me, but since you've repeatedly rejected my kindness, refusing a toast and choosing a forfeit, I can only include you among the millions in my vast river of blood!" [[7329 弗拉德 happy]]
    His lower body completely merged into the river of blood, Vlad's extremely twisted figure now had an even more frenzied expression. With white-gloved hands, he cradled his face, his joints moving as he kneaded his cheeks. [[7330 旁白 happy]]
    "Don't worry, this process won't be very painful. It just starts from your feet, and slowly you won't feel your legs anymore, until your soul is completely submerged in the river of blood, becoming one of these millions. And what you will face is all the lives and souls I've devoured since becoming a blood kin!" [[7331 弗拉德 happy]]
    "Come, just you alone, challenge my Imperial Undead Legion!" [[7332 弗拉德 angry]]
    At the source of the river of blood, the silver-haired man spread his arms, like a sinister monarch of the apocalypse, declaring war. [[7333 旁白 neutral]]
    The river of blood flowed freely, and as long as there were traces of blood on the ground, twisted and immortal monsters would emerge from it. These included humans, orcs, monsters, and even demons. Their eyes were completely replaced by scarlet, and no matter what they were in life, at least now their bodies were puppets controlled by Vlad. [[7334 旁白 fearful]]
    Looking around, countless bodies were squeezed together. It was impossible to know how many lives Vlad had devoured in his existence. [[7335 旁白 neutral]]
    But none of that mattered. The green-haired girl exhaled, and when she opened her eyes again, the twisted, advancing undead legion was already less than ten meters in front of her. [[7336 旁白 neutral]]
    What a disgusting ability... [[7337 旁白 sad]]
    The girl even had the presence of mind to silently complain in her heart. Then, she grabbed the floating emerald holy sword hovering beside her and raised it high above her head. [[7338 旁白 neutral]]
    Theoretically, before the sixth tier, extreme human wave tactics could still wear down high-tier individuals. After the sixth tier, no matter how many pawns were sent, it would only add to the slaughter. [[7339 旁白 neutral]]
    As the newly ascended Saintess, she didn't have much time to hone her strength. The endless undead legion was indeed a huge problem for her, but that referred to reality, and here, it was her territory! [[7340 旁白 neutral]]
    Moreover, with Isabella's power supporting her, her body had become a blood kin, but she was no longer restricted or suppressed by the Thorn Curse. In this gamble, she lacked nothing. [[7341 旁白 neutral]]
    Even if the simulated elements in the collapsing mental space were in disarray, don't forget, she was a free Saintess! [[7342 旁白 neutral]]
    With just one deep breath, a frantic power stirred up a spiraling wind field around her. Green wind patterns, like silkworm threads weaving into a cocoon, encircled the holy sword, gathering into light. [[7343 旁白 neutral]]
    This strike... [[7344 旁白 neutral]]
    "Tear apart your illusions!" [[7345 塞莱斯特 angry]]
    Her originally soft voice showed an unprecedented determination. Pure white feathers wove into free wings behind her, and her green skirt danced with the wind, swaying like a windmill. [[7346 旁白 neutral]]
    "Buzz!" [[7347 旁白 neutral]]
    Celeste raised the Emerald Holy Sword high. The wind patterns instantly condensed into a cocoon, then burst into a hurricane that ripped through the heavens and earth! [[7348 旁白 neutral]]
    Pure white wings spread out furiously, green hair wildly dancing. Where the sword's edge pointed, a pure, extreme emerald light stream roared forth, like a divine judgment descending. In an instant, the surging river of blood was forcefully pierced and evaporated. The "undead legion" made of corrupted flesh and scarlet eyes couldn't even let out a whimper before being torn apart bit by bit and annihilated into nothingness in the absolute storm. [[7349 旁白 fearful]]
    Countless flesh and blood were instantly pulverized, and the crushed blood fell like bloody rain from the sky. Vlad, with only half a body remaining, stared blankly at the river of blood cleansed by the holy wind, still unable to fully recover... [[7350 旁白 sad]]
    He couldn't understand why Celeste, who had always been at a passive disadvantage, and even labeled by him as the weakest Saintess, could suddenly unleash such powerful strength. [[7351 旁白 sad]]
    But all of that, along with his previous defiled illusions, was incinerated. [[7352 旁白 neutral]]
    The last image in the split soul's vision was Celeste's gradually enlarging face, and the emerald holy sword in her hand, piercing inch by inch into his remaining half-body's chest. [[7353 旁白 neutral]]
    The moment the filthy soul touched the holy sword, it let out a piercing shriek. Amidst the burning white smoke, she saw the girl's pink lips move, her voice clear and precise. [[7354 旁白 neutral]]
    "Even if destiny is set, I want to make that choice myself. Even if the choice seems foolish, it's one of the few freedoms in my life not bound by destiny." [[7355 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    "Those who try to control my life, scatter in the free wind!" [[7356 塞莱斯特 angry]]
