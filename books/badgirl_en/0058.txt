Chapter 58 The Despicable Outsiders [[3291 旁白 neutral]]
"Yo, Andre, it's rare to see you at the library~" [[3292 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
A familiar teasing voice came from behind. [[3293 旁白 neutral]]
Andre's movements as he flipped through the old bedside book didn't stop. He responded without turning his head. [[3294 旁白 neutral]]
"Because I finished reading all the books here two years ago, that's why I don't come often." [[3295 安德烈 neutral]]
"Oh, is that so?" [[3296 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
The gray-haired nun sat lazily opposite Andre, her golden-brown eyes smiling, staring intently at the man opposite her. [[3297 旁白 neutral]]
"You only came two years ago, so of course you don't know these things... So why aren't you taking your nap and coming here instead?" [[3298 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre's gaze remained focused on the tattered book in his hand, its yellowed, messy pages not even matching the sequence numbers. [[3299 旁白 neutral]]
"It's not out of curiosity. Father works hard every day and is extremely busy. As a senior nun, I see it and feel it in my heart. I'm afraid Father will overwork himself and faint, so I came to check on him~" [[3300 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
That being said, Isabella's eyes were always fixed on the book in Andre's hand and the spot where he was sitting. [[3301 旁白 neutral]]
Apart from being tattered and old, the book had no other special features. However, the spot where Andre was sitting, whether by chance or coincidence, was also where Sister Evelyn sat in the library every Sunday. [[3302 旁白 neutral]]
"So, Father, why aren't you resting at noon and coming here to read? What kind of book is so captivating?" [[3303 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Well... this book has no name, no author, and no table of contents. You can consider it an unofficial historical record of Kempfer Town." [[3304 安德烈 neutral]]
"Historical record?" [[3305 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella asked subconsciously. [[3306 旁白 neutral]]
Historical records generally only existed in large cities or royal capitals, as compiling history was a huge project, and the tax revenue of ordinary places simply couldn't support such a flashy and luxurious achievement. [[3307 旁白 neutral]]
She hadn't expected that a small, obscure town like Kempfer would have a historical record. [[3308 旁白 surprised]]
"Yes, that's right, but I said it's unofficial. It records various major events from the past of Kempfer Town, but due to its long history and lack of regular compilation, the book is now in disrepair, and many events and dates don't match up." [[3309 安德烈 neutral]]
The man's fingers traced the yellowed, rough pages, his gaze contemplative. [[3310 旁白 neutral]]
"So, are you suddenly interested in the town's history, or do you have a sudden whim to revise this chaotic town history?" [[3311 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Neither..." [[3312 安德烈 neutral]]
The man's gaze and voice suddenly paused, and the atmosphere in the library became somewhat strange. [[3313 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella looked at the golden-haired priest in confusion, and his furrowed brows slowly relaxed. [[3314 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems he found it." [[3315 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre pointed to a section on a page he had just opened. [[3316 旁白 neutral]]
"Found what?" [[3317 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella curiously leaned forward to look. She saw a passage recorded on the page, describing what seemed to be a very, very old major event, interspersed with keywords containing extraordinary power elements such as "Immortal," "Wolf King's Moon," and "Witch's Blood." [[3318 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella subconsciously frowned. These keywords seemed to trigger certain muscle reactions in her, and these subtle expressions were not lost on Andre. [[3319 旁白 neutral]]
"What exactly are these? Are you sure it's a historical record? Not an epic story compiled by a bard?" [[3320 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"My initial thoughts were similar to yours. The past described by these texts was too incredible, completely unlike something that would happen in a remote town like Kempfer. So, I just regarded them as mythological stories fabricated by the town's former historians to expand their records because they couldn't collect information from a certain period." [[3321 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre's voice was unhurried, and his prominent nose carried a unique confident and steady demeanor. [[3322 旁白 neutral]]
"But some recent events have changed my mind." [[3323 安德烈 neutral]]
Perhaps because Andre's tone was too serious, and he didn't usually have such an unreliable personality, Isabella gradually reined in her playful nature and listened intently. [[3324 旁白 neutral]]
"Recently, a group of outsiders came to town." [[3325 安德烈 neutral]]
"I know. They're still staying at William's guesthouse. Sister Mary said they seemed to be a merchant caravan just passing by." [[3326 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Whether they are a normal merchant caravan, I cannot conclude for now, but the goods they are transporting in their carriage are definitely not normal." [[3327 安德烈 neutral]]
"The caravan arrived on Monday evening, and on Tuesday, residents came to the church for confession, saying their livestock had died mysteriously and horribly, without any signs of wolves preying on them. Also..." [[3328 安德烈 fearful]]
"William's family, who took in the caravan, secretly told me today that those outsiders strictly forbid anyone from touching their carriages loaded with goods. Tonight, when Aunt William went out to use the restroom, she vaguely heard beast-like growls faintly coming from the stable where the carriages were parked." [[3329 安德烈 fearful]]
Andre listed all the information he knew. [[3330 旁白 neutral]]
"Beast-like growls, sounds from inside the carriage, and not letting anyone near... Could it be..." [[3331 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
Isabella rested her hand on her chin in thought. When she wasn't being mischievous, she truly seemed to transform from a cunning fox into a calm and rational nun. [[3332 旁白 neutral]]
"Could those outsiders be transporting magical beasts?" [[3333 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella's first thought was this possibility. In the empire's law, the trade of magical beasts was strictly forbidden, but due to the demands of certain underground arenas and powerful nobles, this trade continued despite the prohibitions. Some merchant caravans specifically collaborated with mercenaries to engage in this high-risk, high-reward business. [[3334 旁白 neutral]]
"That possibility cannot be ruled out, but if they were magical beasts, the dead animals should have been gnawed to bones, or even no bones left, just a pool of blood. However, according to the description, although the dead livestock had terrible tearing marks and scratches, without exception, they all lost a large amount of body fluid, and their bodies were stiff like firewood." [[3335 安德烈 fearful]]
Andre described the horrifying scene of the brutal crime, which sent shivers down one's spine just by listening, without any change in expression. Strangely, Isabella, being a woman, also seemed to have no significant emotional fluctuations, only her beautiful willow eyebrows furrowed deeper. [[3336 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, Isabella seemed to remember something and slapped the table. [[3337 旁白 surprised]]
"Wait! All the blood drained from their bodies, this doesn't look like normal magical beast predation. Instead, it's like... a vampire!" [[3338 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
"It seems you're not too stupid after all." [[3339 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre nodded. [[3340 旁白 neutral]]
"So, you also guessed that there might be vampire-like creatures hidden in the carriage, and you also connected it to this historical record you read before, which contains information about Immortals and the Wolf King's Heart?" [[3341 安德烈 neutral]]
"Yes, that's right." [[3342 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"But, but this is too far-fetched..." [[3343 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella still felt something was off. [[3344 旁白 neutral]]
"You said it yourself, the history recorded in this historical record is from a very, very long time ago. Let's not discuss whether the story of the Immortals recorded here is true or not. Even if it is true, it must be a story from thousands of years ago. Can the Immortals who appeared thousands of years ago still be related to the vampire-like enemies we are encountering now?" [[3345 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
