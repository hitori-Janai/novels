Chapter 13: The Imposter [[785 旁白 neutral]]
The night in the Craigmore Wasteland seemed exceptionally quiet. [[786 旁白 neutral]]
But the young man lying on the straw mat couldn't sleep, not for any other reason than his rumbling stomach. [[787 旁白 neutral]]
For dinner, he had only half a bowl of boiled peas, a meal that Anna and her mother could only scrape together from their household stores because of him, their honored guest. [[788 旁白 neutral]]
The diet of commoners in medieval Europe usually consisted of black bread and peas. While commoners might be used to it, for Selen An, who was accustomed to delicacies and had a pampered palate, it was exceptionally difficult. [[789 旁白 neutral]]
If the soul in this body hadn't been replaced, its original owner would probably have rather died than swallow that bowl of tasteless boiled peas. [[790 旁白 neutral]]
But even after forcing himself to finish the half-bowl of peas, he couldn't avoid hunger at night. Half a bowl of peas was simply not enough. Selen An, who had never experienced hunger in his past or present life, couldn't fall asleep on an empty stomach. [[791 旁白 neutral]]
In the darkness, he lay with his eyes open, clearly sensing the two other breaths in the small hut. It was exceptionally quiet. If he didn't know that a large troop of Demon Clan cavalry was searching for him on the Craigmore Wasteland, he might have thought he was camping in the wild. [[792 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps exhausted from searching for food during the day, the mother and daughter were both sleeping soundly. Unable to sleep, Selen An sat up on his straw mat. He saw slivers of bright moonlight through the crack in the door. After a moment of internal debate, he finally decided to stand up, carefully pushed open the wooden door, and stepped out of the hut for the first time. [[793 旁白 neutral]]
A night breeze brushed his cheek, carrying a refreshing coolness unlike the stuffy air inside the hut. Under the moonlight, he looked around at the terrain and finally understood why this place could be a safe zone from the Demon Clan cavalry's search. The shadow cast by the high, steep cliff overhead made it easy to overlook the dilapidated wooden hut in this godforsaken place. [[794 旁白 neutral]]
In short, thanks to the terrain, unless something unexpected happened, the Demon Clan cavalry wouldn't be able to find this place anytime soon, no matter how efficient they were. [[795 旁白 neutral]]
At this thought, Selen An breathed a sigh of relief. [[796 旁白 neutral]]
For some reason, after realizing he was temporarily safe, a weight was lifted from his heart. It wasn't just for his own safety, but more so because he wouldn't be a burden to the mother and daughter inside. [[797 旁白 neutral]]
He felt a constant guilt towards Anna and her mother, even though their misfortune wasn't his fault. Perhaps because Anna's mother had accepted some of his money, he had found the courage to look them in the eye during dinner... [[798 旁白 sad]]
"Whew. I'll rest for one more day, then leave." [[799 塞伦安 neutral]]
Considering he was still injured and his ability to escape was greatly reduced, Selen An rationally decided to rest for another day. He would leave after getting a clear understanding of the terrain and figuring out the best escape route. [[800 旁白 neutral]]
"One day? I'm afraid you won't get your wish." [[801 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Just as Selen An felt the chill of the wind and decided to go back inside to sleep, a voice as clear and cold as the moonlight suddenly rang out. With it came an undeniable chill and sharpness against his neck. [[802 旁白 surprised]]
The young man's body froze. [[803 旁白 fearful]]
"Serenia..." [[804 塞伦安 surprised]]
"It's me." [[805 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
The ice sword at his neck didn't press forward. At the same time, he smelled a strong stench of blood. [[806 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An subconsciously raised his hands and turned around slowly. Under the moonlight, the girl, who was usually so cold and beautiful she seemed otherworldly, was now stained with the crimson of slaughter. Her sacred and noble saintess robe was covered in dried bloodstains. [[807 旁白 neutral]]
Clearly, after pushing him away, Serenia had been through an intense life-or-death battle. Fortunately, as an important character in the game's plot, she, the Ice Saintess, had managed to fight her way out of the Demon Clan cavalry's siege without him holding her back. [[808 旁白 neutral]]
This just went to show how terrifying Serenia's combat power truly was. [[809 旁白 neutral]]
"How did you find me so quickly?" [[810 塞伦安 surprised]]
As mentioned before, due to the terrain, the area where Anna's hut was located was extremely difficult to find. The Craigmore Wasteland was vast, and even a large-scale search would take at least two to three days. [[811 旁白 neutral]]
Less than a day had passed since he woke from his coma. Moreover, the bloodstains on Serenia's saintess robe were only half-dry, which meant she had likely found him immediately after shaking off the pursuing demons. [[812 旁白 neutral]]
"I left a mark on you before I pushed you away." [[813 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
The girl's cold reply was exactly the kind of thing she would do. [[814 旁白 neutral]]
"Come with me." [[815 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"Alright..." [[816 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An didn't refuse; he had no reason to. [[817 旁白 neutral]]
His earlier plea for Serenia to spare him was based on his identity as a human. The Succubus Seed was constantly corrupting his body, so going with Serenia was the most logical choice. Refusing would mean contradicting everything he had just said about his identity. [[818 旁白 neutral]]
Serenia lowered her sword, gave him a deep look, and stepped forward, preparing to bind his hands again. But just then... [[819 旁白 neutral]]
"I'll go with you, but..." [[820 塞伦安 neutral]]
The young man's gaze shifted to the hut, his voice tinged with a plea. [[821 塞伦安 sad]]
"Can you take them with us too?" [[822 塞伦安 sad]]
"They're the ones who saved me. They took me in. If I just leave, the Demon Clan's hounds might follow my scent here. They'll all be in danger." [[823 塞伦安 fearful]]
"That doesn't sound like something you would say." [[824 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
The girl's cold words made the young man flinch, and a bitter smile appeared on his lips. [[825 旁白 neutral]]
"I just... don't want to keep making mistakes in the limited life I have left..." [[826 塞伦安 sad]]
At these words, Serenia's expressionless face showed a hint of emotion. She sheathed her sword and came to stand before him, her beautiful eyes, like tranquil blue ice crystals, staring intently into his. [[827 旁白 neutral]]
Now, there was no sound but the night wind. [[828 旁白 neutral]]
After a long moment, Serenia suddenly raised her hand and pressed her palm firmly against Selen An's forehead. He instinctively wanted to struggle, but the girl's warning came. [[829 旁白 surprised]]
"Don't move, or you'll face the consequences." [[830 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
"What are you trying to do?" [[831 塞伦安 fearful]]
There was a tremor in the young man's voice. He could clearly feel a strange energy moving inside him where Serenia's palm touched his skin. [[832 旁白 fearful]]
"I'm checking your soul." [[833 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"..." [[834 塞伦安 fearful]]
That answer sent a cold sweat down Selen An's back. [[835 旁白 fearful]]
Oh no, she's using the cheat detector! [[836 旁白 fearful]]
The body was the original, so there was no problem. That was why Selen An dared to play the sympathy card while Serenia had a sword to his neck; he was essentially using this body's original connections. [[837 旁白 neutral]]
But no matter how perfect the body was, his soul was a brand-new, unfamiliar account. It wouldn't stand up to inspection. One check and he was toast! [[838 旁白 fearful]]
But he couldn't stop it. The moment Serenia got close, his body felt frozen, completely unable to move. He could only let Serenia use some unknown method to expose him as an imposter... [[839 旁白 fearful]]
If the memories he saw while unconscious were real, then this body's original owner held a special place in Serenia's heart. Although he had fallen from grace after everything that happened, a fallen white moonlight was still a white moonlight! [[840 旁白 neutral]]
And now, if she found out he was an imposter who had kicked out the saintess's precious white moonlight brother, well, the outcome didn't need much explanation, did it? [[841 旁白 fearful]]
