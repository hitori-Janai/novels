Chapter 98: No Other Choice (Two-in-one) [[5501 旁白 neutral]]
"Isabella, I'm giving you a chance. Join us." [[5502 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
In the dark, damp cellar, Serafina stood on Earl Rose's side, holding the fainted girl, and spoke to Isabella in a cold voice. [[5503 旁白 neutral]]
A cold wind gently brushed Isabella's dusty cheek. Her tangled gray hair swayed softly, and her golden-brown eyes... trembled and trembled. [[5504 旁白 fearful]]
"Serafina... what are you saying? Repeat it..." [[5505 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Serafina, dressed as a nun but actually a vampire, secretly sighed. She clearly sensed the disbelief in Isabella's eyes, and a hint of helplessness flashed in her own. [[5506 旁白 sad]]
"Isabella, we grew up like sisters. You know I wouldn't harm you, so..." [[5507 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"I told you to repeat what you just said!" [[5508 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
Though her lips were pale, Isabella's soul-shaking roar drowned out everything. [[5509 旁白 neutral]]
Interrupted, Serafina paused. Her explanation, like a pale piece of paper, was ruthlessly torn apart by Isabella, who she once considered a sister. Her fingertips, holding the girl in her arms, clenched slightly, and her blood-red eyes dimmed further. [[5510 旁白 sad]]
As expected, once exposed, did things have to come to this? [[5511 旁白 sad]]
Earl Rose watched from the side with interest. His relaxed gaze made it seem like he was sitting in a grand theater, watching an exciting play. [[5512 旁白 neutral]]
In fact, it was quite similar. Plays needed actors, but reality didn't. He savored the painful yet sweet taste of truth being cruelly revealed. [[5513 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, Avril, if you can't bring yourself to do it, I can do it for you. After all, helping others is a traditional virtue of us blood nobles. I'd be happy to have another beautiful and stubborn daughter tonight~" [[5514 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
After all, isn't that where the fun in training comes from? [[5515 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
Earl Rose didn't say the last sentence aloud, but his perverted thoughts were fully exposed through his greedy, covetous gaze. [[5516 旁白 neutral]]
"No, give me a little more time." [[5517 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Serafina moved silently, blocking Earl Rose's greedy gaze towards Isabella with her body. [[5518 旁白 neutral]]
Earl Rose noticed this small gesture and snorted, but didn't insist. Although the female slave was clearly incomparable to his noble status, even when beating a dog, one had to consider its owner. This female slave was still working for the Duke, and thinking of the chilling aura emanating from the Duke... [[5519 旁白 neutral]]
Desires had to be put aside for now; after all, he only had one life. As for "daughters," as long as he was alive, he wondered how many beautiful human women would be eager to become his daughters. [[5520 旁白 neutral]]
As long as greed and desire existed in human hearts, there would always be someone who couldn't refuse eternal life, and eternal life was a privilege exclusive to vampires. [[5521 旁白 neutral]]
"Isabella, listen to me..." [[5522 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"What did he just call you?" [[5523 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
The girl holding the gun lowered her head, letting her messy gray hair obscure her expression. If Serafina hadn't heard the girl's familiar yet low voice, a stranger might not have found the source of the sound for a while. [[5524 旁白 neutral]]
"..." [[5525 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
What Serafina had just wanted to say got stuck in her throat again. She took a few deep breaths, exhaled, and then spoke again. [[5526 旁白 neutral]]
"Avril." [[5527 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Avril, is that your new name?" [[5528 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella's questioning clearly hit a sensitive spot Serafina didn't want to touch. But the other person was a sister she had known for years. Even though she had become a vampire, losing much of her human tenderness, the sisterhood forged by time still retained its warmth. [[5529 旁白 sad]]
If an ordinary person had questioned her so incessantly, she might have silenced them with a single strike. But this was Isabella, the "sister" who had accompanied her since childhood. She had to suppress her cold, tyrannical vampire nature and try to explain in a gentle tone. [[5530 旁白 neutral]]
"Yes, this is my name as a vampire." [[5531 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Heh, hehe..." [[5532 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
After suppressing her reluctance and patiently answering, she received only Isabella's cold, mocking laugh, devoid of warmth. [[5533 旁白 neutral]]
"Serafina, you b*tch!" [[5534 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
"What benefits did these undead monsters give you, that you, a holy nun, would rather abandon your faith and betray the master you swore loyalty to with your soul!" [[5535 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
Isabella, with her head bowed, seemed to have used all her strength to utter the most venomous words of her life. She suddenly looked up, her silver hair flying. Her usually cunning and bright golden-brown eyes were now filled with dense bloodshot veins. [[5536 旁白 angry]]
She gritted her teeth, speaking each word slowly, almost as if weeping blood, as she questioned her former sister. [[5537 旁白 angry]]
Being cursed like this to her face, the innate tyranny in her demon bloodline was like a bomb about to ignite. Serafina's blood-red vertical pupils uncontrollably erupted with killing intent, and her body trembled slightly. [[5538 旁白 angry]]
But when she clearly saw Isabella's familiar face again, she bit the tip of her tongue, painstakingly suppressing the tyrannical urge with the pain and her will. [[5539 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, her delicate body stopped trembling, and her previously abnormally scarlet eyes became much calmer. [[5540 旁白 neutral]]
"I accept all your insults. If cursing me makes you feel a little better, then curse me as much as you want..." [[5541 塞拉菲娜 sad]]
She controlled her voice to remain calm, but in reality, her heart was far from it, because Isabella's words just now accurately struck a major pain point in her heart... [[5542 旁白 sad]]
Abandoning her former name after becoming a vampire had always been a difficult hurdle for her. [[5543 旁白 sad]]
The name "Serafina" held a unique and inseparable special meaning for her. This name was bestowed upon her by His Highness, and similarly, Isabella's name was also acquired this way. [[5544 旁白 neutral]]
She still clearly remembered that before receiving a name from His Highness, they were called by codes like No. 1, No. 8, No. 17, No. 35, which were not names at all. Like Isabella, she was an orphan, raised in an orphanage, a commodity that merchants and nobles could pick or discard at any time. [[5545 旁白 sad]]
After getting new guardians, they would get new names, so to save trouble and for easy management, the director uniformly called the children in the orphanage by code names. [[5546 旁白 neutral]]
At that time, she was No. 17, and Isabella was No. 33. Every few days, children in the orphanage would be adopted or taken away. Most adopters only valued boys or girls with good looks and decent development. Due to long-term malnutrition, she and Isabella, thin and sallow-faced, were often the unnoticed ones in the corner, with almost no chance of being adopted. [[5547 旁白 sad]]
If they weren't adopted by the age of 14, the director would kick them out of the orphanage, leaving them to fend for themselves. In that dark and barren environment, the weak her and No. 33 huddled together for warmth, having imagined countless times in their minds the scenes of freezing and starving to death after being driven out... [[5548 旁白 fearful]]
As they grew older, this fate seemed unavoidable, until that day arrived... [[5549 旁白 neutral]]
It was a sunny morning. An exquisite, luxurious carriage stopped at the orphanage's entrance. In the corner, she held the still-sleeping No. 33, staring blankly at the carriage. In her memory, she had never seen such a beautiful and noble carriage. [[5550 旁白 surprised]]
To ride in such a beautiful carriage, surely someone of noble status, like a princess or prince, must be inside... [[5551 旁白 neutral]]
She thought so, and then the director frantically gathered all the children to the hall, her wrinkled old face showing an eager expression, like a brightly blooming chrysanthemum. [[5552 旁白 neutral]]
The director adopted a respectful and as gentle as possible posture, standing beside the children as if displaying merchandise. [[5553 旁白 neutral]]
"Respected young lady, these are all the children in our orphanage. Which one catches your eye?" [[5554 院长 neutral]]
Under the sunlight, the beautiful nun sister respectfully opened the carriage door. [[5555 旁白 neutral]]
"Clack~" [[5556 旁白 neutral]]
A clear sound, like spring water tapping the floor, immediately made the children's eyes burst with light. Having been selected like commodities by various dignitaries for years, they had long developed a special skill of identifying people by sound. [[5557 旁白 neutral]]
Such a special sound meant that most likely, a noblewoman of esteemed status had arrived, because only noblewomen liked to wear such special high-heeled shoes. [[5558 旁白 neutral]]
Following the sound, she subconsciously stretched her neck. It was a dirty little black face. The No. 33 in her arms also seemed to have been woken by her movement, and like her, poked out a small, dirty face. [[5559 旁白 neutral]]
The two of them had simply poked their heads out of curiosity, but after seeing the newcomer's appearance, they both froze in a daze... [[5560 旁白 surprised]]
So this time, it wasn't a princess, nor a prince. Was it a legendary fairy? [[5561 旁白 surprised]]
They weren't the only ones in this dazed state; almost all the children, including the director, were the same. [[5562 旁白 neutral]]
Her soft, cyan long hair cascaded like a waterfall. Her delicate, watery skin could rival the white snow in winter. The exquisite silk dress on her highlighted her unparalleled nobility and ethereal grace. [[5563 旁白 neutral]]
A gentle breeze, swayed by her skirt, blew in from outside the door. The restless hearts were calmed at this moment, and everyone's breathing seemed to synchronize as they stared in a daze at the holy figure moving with the wind and light. [[5564 旁白 neutral]]
She simply stood there, smiling, and the world seemed to fall silent. Finally, a sweet sound, soft as an oriole leaving a valley, echoed in everyone's ears. [[5565 旁白 neutral]]
"Director, could you please bring those two children out separately?" [[5566 陌生女1 neutral]]
The cyan-haired fairy pointed with her finger at the two small heads peeking out from the back of the crowd. There was an unconcealed tenderness and kindness in her emerald eyes. [[5567 旁白 neutral]]
The lives of No. 17 and No. 33 were changed forever. From then on, the orphanage had two fewer nameless girls. Beside the noble young saintess were two young nuns of similar age, one named Serafina, and the other Isabella... [[5568 旁白 neutral]]
These were the most beautiful and redemptive memories deep within her soul, the most precious things she would never forget in her life. But everything changed after that ambushed mission. [[5569 旁白 sad]]
After being forced to assimilate into a vampire, she resisted, she struggled, even mutilated her vampire body until it was in tatters. As His Highness's personal nun, she was captured and assimilated by vampires. She should have taken her own life in the prison woven by the enemy, but the immortal nature of vampires made it difficult for her to even embrace death. [[5570 旁白 sad]]
Continuously committing suicide, resurrecting, committing suicide, resurrecting, her vampire body was almost at its limit, and her mind was on the verge of collapse. The jailers said that if this continued, even if she didn't die, her crumbling mind would cause her body to lose control, turning her into the lowest and dirtiest ghoul. [[5571 旁白 fearful]]
Weak, she curled up in the corner, with only numbness and a tiny sliver of relief left in her heart. [[5572 旁白 sad]]
After countless suicides, she was long numb to the pain of death. If her mind truly collapsed and she became that kind of monster, it would be a different kind of release from death for her. [[5573 旁白 neutral]]
Holding onto this belief, she slowly closed her eyes, preparing to give up the last shred of perseverance and struggle in her soul, accelerating the arrival of this outcome. [[5574 旁白 neutral]]
Serafina's life should have ended there. Just as her vision was about to be completely engulfed by darkness, the prison door opened. The filthy vampire bloodline within her suddenly began to stir, a stimulus that forced her to open her eyes. [[5575 旁白 neutral]]
"..." [[5576 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Her breathing was so faint it was almost imperceptible, and there was no belief in living left in her dull, grayish eyes. [[5577 旁白 sad]]
"Do you long for death so much?" [[5578 陌生男1 neutral]]
With her head bowed, she could only see the hem of a luxurious, colorful coat and shiny leather shoes. [[5579 旁白 neutral]]
"..." [[5580 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Still no response, and the last bit of light in her eyes was rapidly fading. If this continued, in less than a minute, there would be one less vampire in the cell and one more ugly ghoul. [[5581 旁白 neutral]]
"Eternal life, how wonderful~" [[5582 陌生男1 neutral]]
The strange man casually sighed, then suddenly let out a soft "heh," and changed his tone. [[5583 旁白 neutral]]
"Even if you shun this body like a viper, some people truly need such an opportunity. For example, the lineage of the Wind Saintess, who is afflicted with the Thorn Curse?" [[5584 陌生男1 neutral]]
The man's seemingly casual and indifferent remark, however, pulled Serafina's dissipating soul back. Her already weak body suddenly erupted with terrifying obsession upon hearing those words. She abruptly widened her eyes, her bloodshot dark pupils staring fixedly at the man in front of her. [[5585 旁白 surprised]]
"You said... what?" [[5586 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
Due to prolonged torture and self-harm, the girl's voice was no longer crisp and melodious as usual, but hoarse like an old bellows. [[5587 旁白 neutral]]
"Am I not speaking the truth? I know very well that death is a release for you now, but you may not fear death. However, can you bear to watch your young master, to whom you swore loyalty with your soul, suddenly wither at such a beautiful and vibrant age, like a blooming flower?" [[5588 陌生男1 neutral]]
This strangely appearing blood noble with a unique temperament seemed to carry a different kind of magic in his voice. Just a few words made Serafina, who was determined to die, completely cast death aside. [[5589 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't try to deceive me with your cunning lies, my Lady..." [[5590 塞拉菲娜 angry]]
"Am I wrong? The master you swore loyalty to, the next Wind Saintess who is about to ascend, she should have the Thorn Curse inherited from her mother, right?" [[5591 陌生男1 neutral]]
"You! How do you know..." [[5592 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
Serafina excitedly wanted to prop herself up, but her riddled body was too weak. Her desperate struggles to stand up, in the man's eyes, were nothing more than the final struggles of a dying fawn. [[5593 旁白 neutral]]
"Why? Because I am a Duke of the blood clan, a high-ranking individual in the demon world!" [[5594 陌生男1 neutral]]
"The current Wind Saintess, Alarriel, was afflicted with a curse during the battle with Samigina 16 years ago. Since then, the Wind Saintess has almost withdrawn from the frontline of disputes between the Empire and the demon world. You humans might use various reasons to cover it up, but we great demons of the demon world are very clear about it~" [[5595 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Samigina's Thorn Curse invoked demonic power. Such a curse not only eternally torments the cursed, but also affects the children she gives birth to." [[5596 陌生男1 neutral]]
"A demon-god level curse. If your worshipped gods didn't personally intervene, it's likely that both mother and daughter would never escape the torment of the Thorn Curse throughout their lives. This isn't the most important thing. Your young master will, like her mother, die young. If this problem isn't resolved soon, this will be her unavoidable fate." [[5597 陌生男1 neutral]]
"I only want the loyalty in your heart for her. My observations of you these past few days are enough to prove that your love for the Saintess who is about to ascend is far greater than your own~" [[5598 陌生男1 neutral]]
"I appreciate people like you, so I can give you a chance." [[5599 陌生男1 neutral]]
"What do you want to do?" [[5600 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
At this moment, the girl's voice was uncontrollably trembling. A crazy thought emerged in her mind, a thought so blasphemous that merely recalling it made her feel utterly defiled. [[5601 旁白 fearful]]
"Isn't it obvious?" [[5602 陌生男1 neutral]]
He reached out, his white-gloved hand hooking the girl's chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. [[5603 旁白 neutral]]
"As long as you obediently listen to me and become mine, I have a way to turn your master into a blood clan member like you and me. The blood clan possesses eternal life, so she can avoid an early death. As for the torment of the Thorn Curse, although it is a demon-god level curse, there is a huge loophole..." [[5604 陌生男1 neutral]]
"That is, the Thorn Curse doesn't work on blood clan members who are also demons~" [[5605 陌生男1 neutral]]
Demonic words echoed in her ears, shaking something steadfast within the girl's heart. [[5606 旁白 neutral]]
P.S. I got carried away writing, this two-in-one chapter is almost 5000 words. Seeing how hard the author worked, please don't just add it to your library. Give some rewards and encouragement! I want money, woo woo woo~ [[5607 旁白 neutral]]
