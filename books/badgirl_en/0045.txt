Chapter 45: The Priest [[2563 旁白 neutral]]
"After this battle, the Demon Clan suffered a great defeat. Not only was their commander beheaded, but the remaining scattered troops were also completely wiped out by the timely arrival of the Church's crusaders!" [[2564 旁白 neutral]]
Early in the morning, as the first ray of sunlight pierced through the night, the rooster from John's house climbed the dirt mound and crowed loudly. The residents of Kempfer gradually woke up from their dreams, injecting life and vitality into the small town. [[2565 旁白 neutral]]
Mike's Clear Wind Tavern was open all night. Aside from a few drunkards who were sprawled unconscious on the tables, the area outside the tavern was a gathering place for children. Dressed in various clothes, the children surrounded the tavern's resident bard, listening attentively as he told stories about the Church's Saintess fighting against the Demon Clan. [[2566 旁白 neutral]]
Matthew, the bard, was dressed in old and messy clothes, sitting on an empty wine barrel. In one hand, he held half a pot of ale he had just begged from the tavern, and in the other, he carried his ancestral old wooden harp. [[2567 旁白 neutral]]
"Are there more, Mr. Matthew?" [[2568 陌生男1 neutral]]
"What happened next? What else happened?" [[2569 陌生女1 neutral]]
"What about that mysterious Saintess? Matthew, don't keep it a secret." [[2570 陌生男1 neutral]]
Facing the children's almost eager and burning eyes, Matthew proudly raised his head. Perhaps only at this moment could he enjoy the brief feeling of being surrounded and desperately needed by others. [[2571 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, children, your parents should have taught you that any request is best supported by a reward. What I said earlier was the free part, as for what comes next..." [[2572 马修 neutral]]
He looked at the children with eager eyes, cunningly rubbing his hands together. [[2573 旁白 neutral]]
Upon hearing this, the children looked at each other, all showing bitter expressions. Kempfer was just an extremely ordinary small town. Located in the territory of the Windermere Family and protected by the God of Wind, it had been peaceful for many years, but it was certainly not wealthy. [[2574 旁白 neutral]]
Children rarely had pocket money, and even if they did, they would have long since spent it on various snacks. How could they have spare money left now to tip the tavern's bard? [[2575 旁白 neutral]]
Watching the group of children all look troubled, Matthew self-satisfiedly raised his ale pot, took a sip of the leftover ale from the night before, and leisurely enjoyed the sight of the little rascals scratching their heads. [[2576 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing their awkward expressions, wanting to hear the rest of the story but unable to produce money, always brought him a lot of fun. However, he wasn't really earning money from these children. He was pondering, waiting for these little rascals to beg him a few more times, then he would mercifully tell them, perhaps gaining a lot of grateful glances and words. [[2577 旁白 neutral]]
But then he heard two crisp clinks beside his ear. In the morning light, two silver coins engraved with a wolf head emblem lay flat on the lid of the wine barrel, shimmering brightly. [[2578 旁白 neutral]]
"Two silver wolves, please tell us a bit more." [[2579 陌生男1 neutral]]
Matthew's eyes lit up as he looked at the extra tip. Following the familiar voice, he saw a tall man with golden hair and blue eyes standing by the stream on the edge of the town, his face covered in sweat. [[2580 旁白 neutral]]
His features were sharp and defined, and his tall stature clearly indicated he was strong and robust. At a glance, he was the typical tough-guy type, but the man with a tough exterior always liked to wear glasses, and his white priestly robes confirmed his identity as a clergyman. [[2581 旁白 neutral]]
"Father Andre, what brings you here?" [[2582 马修 surprised]]
Matthew hastily put away the two silver wolf coins, looking at the white-robed priest, his tone unconsciously carrying a hint of reverence, and his eyes showing a touch of flattered surprise. [[2583 旁白 neutral]]
"Just passing by on my morning run, and I happened to hear what you and the children were saying..." [[2584 安德烈 neutral]]
The young man, whom Matthew called Andre, reached up with his middle finger to adjust the glasses on his nose. He nodded to Matthew, and his gaze towards the children softened considerably. [[2585 旁白 neutral]]
"Good morning, Father Andre!" [[2586 孩子们 happy]]
Not only Matthew, but the children gathered around the tavern also clearly knew this young priest and greeted him warmly, showing no awe or shyness towards a clergyman. [[2587 旁白 neutral]]
"Good morning, children." [[2588 安德烈 happy]]
"It seems you're still so interested in that story from four years ago..." [[2589 安德烈 neutral]]
"Uncle Matthew said he knew the rest of the story, so we ran over to listen." [[2590 孩子们 neutral]]
The children chattered all at once. [[2591 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh~" [[2592 安德烈 neutral]]
Saying this, he glanced with a smile at Matthew, who was sitting on the wooden barrel. The latter startled, quickly jumped off the barrel, stood respectfully in place, and awkwardly shrunk his neck a bit. [[2593 旁白 neutral]]
"Father Andre, about that... please let me explain, I..." [[2594 马修 fearful]]
"No need to explain to me. You haven't done anything wrong. As long as you don't deliberately smear the Church, I think the stories you make up are quite interesting. So, continue your story." [[2595 安德烈 neutral]]
"Thank you for your kindness. May the wind carve your path." [[2596 马修 happy]]
Matthew sincerely praised and blessed him. [[2597 旁白 neutral]]
The man waved his hand indifferently, bid farewell to the shabby bard and the enthusiastic children, and resumed his morning run along the stream. [[2598 旁白 neutral]]
The figures around the tavern behind him became smaller and smaller. Accompanied by a few melodious harp notes, Matthew picked up his unique vocal style and began his "work" for the day. [[2599 旁白 neutral]]
"Legend says that the mysterious Saintess is the Water Saintess who disappeared many years ago. In that battle, the Water Saintess and the Ice Saintess jointly slew the evil demon general, but unfortunately, they were injured..." [[2600 马修 neutral]]
"What? The Saintess is injured?!" [[2601 孩子们 surprised]]
"Let's defeat those evil demons! How dare they harm Lady Saintess!" [[2602 孩子们 angry]]
... [[2603 旁白 neutral]]
... [[2604 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, those subtle sounds reached the young priest's ears, causing him to curve the corner of his lips. [[2605 旁白 neutral]]
Matthew still loved to spout nonsense and fool children, always adding his own embellishments to existing information or stories, calling them "exclusive news." Of course, this trick had long been exposed and known by the residents of the small town; few people believed his exclusive news was real, and now it seemed he could only fool children. [[2606 旁白 neutral]]
However, speaking of which, although he made it up himself, if compared to the facts, he actually guessed quite a lot correctly. [[2607 旁白 neutral]]
But none of this concerned him now. They were discussing the mysterious Water Saintess, and he was the priest of this small town's church, Andre was his current name. [[2608 旁白 neutral]]
Continuing his morning run along the stream, this was a habit he had maintained for four years. By the stream, women in simple cloth skirts were washing clothes. Seeing Andre running along the stream, they all greeted him warmly and politely. [[2609 旁白 neutral]]
Watching the young priest's disappearing back, the women washing clothes couldn't help but gossip. [[2610 妇人1 neutral]]
"Mr. Andre is really young. To become a priest at such a young age, he's much more promising than my good-for-nothing son." [[2611 妇人1 neutral]]
"Ah, he's truly a handsome young man who makes it hard to look away. It seems Mr. Andre is also of marriageable age. I wonder if my daughter has a chance..." [[2612 妇人2 sad]]
"Don't even think about it. Mr. Andre is the most popular person in our small town. There are so many girls who want to marry him, why would it be your daughter's turn?" [[2613 妇人3 neutral]]
"I don't agree with that. I admit many young girls like Mr. Andre, but if we're judging the most popular person in town, it still has to be Sister Evelyn. No one can resist Miss Evelyn's smile, no one!" [[2614 妇人4 happy]]
"Indeed, but Miss Evelyn can't be seen every day, while Mr. Andre can. Just based on that, I feel the difference between the two is quite small." [[2615 妇人5 neutral]]
By the stream, the women's gossip continued, one sentence after another, mixed with complaints about life and daily routines, as if this was an indispensable part of Kempfer town's daily life. [[2616 旁白 neutral]]
Until those voices were completely left behind and could no longer be heard, the young priest slowed his steps, wiped the fine sweat from his forehead, and looked up at the familiar building in front of him. [[2617 旁白 neutral]]
The only church in Kempfer town, and the place where he, as a priest, worked every day. [[2618 旁白 neutral]]
