Chapter 64: The Gravedigger [[3625 旁白 neutral]]

Three hours later... [[3626 旁白 neutral]]
Under the bright moonlight, the courtyard was a bloody hell. [[3627 旁白 fearful]]
Andre stepped on the blood-soaked ground, his bayonet dripping blood non-stop. Looking up, corpses lay everywhere in the entire courtyard, and blood flowed like a river. [[3628 旁白 neutral]]
The ugly and fierce ghoul corpses almost formed a small hill. In addition, on the courtyard walls, there were two vampire corpses nailed to the wall. Their hearts or heads were pierced by long nails made of mithril. [[3629 旁白 neutral]]
"Now, only you are left..." [[3630 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre's voice held a hint of tiredness, but his green eyes showed no slack, his gaze as deep as a dark pool. [[3631 旁白 neutral]]
His white gloves were completely stained red with the enemy's blood, and he had several shallow and deep wounds on his left arm and waist. An ordinary person would have fainted from pain with such injuries. [[3632 旁白 neutral]]
Thanks to some strange advantages his body originally had, and his continued adherence to the training methods left by the old man over the years, his body was now as strong as an ox, completely different from his previous weak and pale image. Minor exposed wounds were not worth mentioning. [[3633 旁白 neutral]]
Opposite him, the only living being in the small courtyard, was the dying monster leaning against the carriage, its body broken. [[3634 旁白 neutral]]
Since being embraced into the Bloodline by his family, Sasha had never been as miserable as he was today. His right arm and left leg were severed from the root. The wounds caused by the high-purity mithril bayonet could greatly suppress the vampires' self-healing ability. Additionally, with the invisible "Discipline" cast upon him, the terrifying immortal regeneration ability of the vampires was almost half-废. [[3635 旁白 sad]]
The injuries to his torso were no lighter than the dismemberment. In the previous fierce battle, his right hand was crippled, his left hand was tangled, and the blond priest took the opportunity to pull out a revolver and fire a shot at his lower abdomen. [[3636 旁白 sad]]
A demon-hunting bullet soaked in holy water, hitting the abdomen at such close range, the spiraling bullet tore all the surrounding flesh like a black hole. The gruesome wound was bloody and blurred, and the white flames bursting from the bullet burned his flesh, making him almost wish for death. [[3637 旁白 sad]]
Now, with only one hand and one leg left, he had completely lost all combat power. As for escaping... [[3638 旁白 sad]]
That was almost impossible. The blond priest, at the very beginning of the battle, had cut off his bat wings with a strangely shaped sword. Without wings and with only one leg, his movement speed was probably not much faster than a worm's. [[3639 旁白 sad]]
From being full of confidence and setting up an ambush at the beginning, to being slightly surprised in the middle with the advantage on his side, and finally to his current desperate, sweating state, Sasha's heart felt as thrilling as a roller coaster ride. [[3640 旁白 surprised]]
"You... ugh... you're not a werewolf..." [[3641 撒夏 surprised]]
Thick blood blocked his throat, making his voice hoarse and broken. [[3642 旁白 neutral]]
As the battle came to an end, Sasha finally realized one thing: this strong-as-an-ox, incredibly powerful priest in front of him was not a werewolf! [[3643 旁白 surprised]]
The reason was simple: before, the priest stayed indoors, didn't transform, and could use the house to block the moon, explaining why he didn't directly touch the moonlight. But after fighting in the courtyard for so long, this blond priest had not shown any werewolf traits, except for his incredibly fierce fighting style. [[3644 旁白 neutral]]
This was impossible. Werewolves would uncontrollably transform upon contact with moonlight. Yet, this person who had pushed him to desperation was truly just a human priest! [[3645 旁白 surprised]]
Sasha's eyes were full of disbelief. Ever since he became a vampire, he instinctively felt disgusted with his former weak self. He also subconsciously regarded his former kind as ants that could be crushed at will. [[3646 旁白 neutral]]
This was indeed true. Ordinary people couldn't even defeat ghouls, let alone the stronger, intelligent, noble vampires. [[3647 旁白 neutral]]
But this priest shattered that fixed impression. At the same level, he charged into 33 enemy units alone, exchanging injuries for all the ghouls and his two companions. [[3648 旁白 neutral]]
He had thought that after such a long struggle, the priest's stamina would be exhausted, and he could reap the benefits, taking all the credit for himself tonight. But the priest's bayonet shattered his illusion! [[3649 旁白 sad]]
The vampires' proud self-healing ability and powerful bodies were nothing in front of the blond priest. He cut off his limbs, crippled his wings, and with unmatched brutality, completely crushed his pride as a vampire... [[3650 旁白 sad]]
Can this really be a power that humans possess? [[3651 撒夏 surprised]]
Andre glanced at the miserable, slumped vampire on the ground, his green eyes still calm. [[3652 旁白 neutral]]
"There were never any seals or werewolves here, only gravediggers waiting to bite off your necks." [[3653 安德烈 neutral]]
"So, why did you have this mistaken idea that I'm a werewolf? Is it because vampires' brains have rotted into empty shells, making them this stupid?" [[3654 安德烈 angry]]
Sasha was so enraged that he almost passed out, unable to catch his breath. [[3655 旁白 angry]]
A rare, unhealthy blush appeared on his pale cheeks from anger, and his crimson eyes glowed with the most venomous hatred. [[3656 旁白 angry]]
"You damned beast! The great Lord Count will not let you go!" [[3657 撒夏 angry]]
"Even if you kill me, your good days are over! Hahaha!" [[3658 撒夏 angry]]
The crazed laughter immediately made Andre frown. He stepped forward, without a word, raising his hand and bringing down his blade. [[3659 旁白 neutral]]
Two more swift silver flashes passed, accompanied by Sasha's tragic wails, and his last arm and leg were also severed from his body. [[3660 旁白 fearful]]
The pungent smell of blood in the air grew thicker, and Sasha's gaze towards Andre was no longer hateful, but entirely fearful. [[3661 旁白 fearful]]
"No, you can't do this to me! I still know a lot of information, a lot of information that's very important to you, you can't... ugh!" [[3662 撒夏 fearful]]
This time, Sasha's words were not even finished before he was forcibly "silenced." [[3663 旁白 neutral]]
Because Andre cut off his tongue. [[3664 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't worry, once we go back, I have ways to extract the information I want from your mouth. But before that, I need to find a way to make you quiet..." [[3665 安德烈 neutral]]
"Being so noisy, it would be bad if you disturbed the residents' rest." [[3666 安德烈 neutral]]
He said lightly, putting away his blood-stained bayonet. Sasha, whose tongue had been cut off, had completely fainted from the pain. Andre mercilessly dragged the vampire, who had been turned into a human pig, by his long hair. [[3667 旁白 neutral]]
After all, the priest practiced humanitarianism, and monsters like vampires were not considered human, so their feelings did not need to be considered. [[3668 旁白 neutral]]
Andre dragged Sasha around the courtyard. Along the way, he opened test tubes filled with high-grade holy water, sprinkling the liquid, which was more precious than gold, onto the rotting corpses on the ground. [[3669 旁白 neutral]]
Upon contact with the foul-smelling corpses, the holy water instantly ignited with sacred white flames. The flames engulfed these dirty beings hidden in the darkness, purifying everything they left behind. [[3670 旁白 neutral]]
The courtyard gate was open. Under the illumination of the white flames, the silhouette of the white-robed priest dragging the vampire gradually faded into the night... [[3671 旁白 neutral]]
