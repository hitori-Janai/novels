Chapter 114: Grand Victory [[6693 旁白 neutral]]
Roland City, atop the Bell Tower. [[6694 旁白 neutral]]
As the highest point in all of Roland City, a giant bronze bell hung there, broadcasting the time to all citizens. But at this moment, the elderly bell-ringer was nowhere to be seen. Instead, an old man in red priestly robes stood there. [[6695 旁白 neutral]]
"Your Grace, all the priests have now lit the anchor points, and the barrier is fully expanded. Regarding the next step..." [[6696 陌生女1 neutral]]
A young nun with flaxen hair appeared silently behind the old man, kneeling on one knee and bowing her head, reporting respectfully. [[6697 旁白 neutral]]
"Where is the Saintess?" [[6698 主教 neutral]]
His voice, though old, was deep and resonant. The red-robed Bishop gazed at the sky, which was completely stained by blue and red, his wrinkled face deeply furrowed. [[6699 旁白 neutral]]
"Her Royal Highness, the Saintess..." [[6700 陌生女1 neutral]]
The nun's voice clearly hesitated. [[6701 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmph! I knew it! Those incompetent fools couldn't even keep an eye on a little girl!" [[6702 主教 angry]]
Clear anger burst forth, and the unnamed nun bowed her head even lower. [[6703 旁白 neutral]]
"Your Grace, Her Royal Highness was in Iron City before. Bishop Wien received the Saintess's party in the agreed-upon manner. Logically, it shouldn't have..." [[6704 陌生女1 neutral]]
"Eleanor, saying such things shows you are still too young. You don't understand our newly enthroned Saintess. Don't look at her young age; her personality is no less troublesome than her mother's." [[6705 主教 neutral]]
With a heavy sigh, from the nun's perspective, the elderly Bishop's body seemed to hunch even more, and his withered, branch-like hands clenched under his red robe. [[6706 旁白 neutral]]
"According to the area where the elemental storm first started, it should be Kempfa Town near Roland City. That place is remote, and the people are simple. Logically, such a large-scale..." [[6707 陌生女1 neutral]]
The nun paused, finally uttering those few difficult words. [[6708 旁白 neutral]]
"Regional disaster." [[6709 陌生女1 fearful]]
"Still too young..." [[6710 主教 neutral]]
The red-robed Bishop, with his back to her, merely sighed, clearly aware of some past secrets the young nun did not know. [[6711 旁白 neutral]]
"Since it has happened, we must try our best to remedy it. Relying on those old fellows from the other dioceses is wishful thinking, Eleanor..." [[6712 主教 neutral]]
"I'm here, Your Grace." [[6713 陌生女1 neutral]]
"Later, you will give my staff to Priest Ryan, and he will assist the City Lord in temporarily managing all affairs of Roland City." [[6714 主教 neutral]]
"Your Grace, are you going to..." [[6715 陌生女1 surprised]]
Eleanor looked up in astonishment, her orange pupils contracting. [[6716 旁白 surprised]]
"Such a big event has occurred. Although it's those fellows in Iron City who failed to guard her properly, I also bear some responsibility. Since it concerns the Saintess, I will go personally this time." [[6717 主教 neutral]]
"No, Your Grace! You are advanced in age. How can we let you go to such a dangerous place?" [[6718 陌生女1 fearful]]
In her agitation, the nun even improperly tugged at the old man's red robe. [[6719 旁白 neutral]]
"Let go. I am old, but not useless. It's just a Forbidden Spell-level energy fluctuation, it's not enough to..." [[6720 主教 neutral]]
The red-robed Bishop said this, but under his pale hair, two or three drops of sweat still trickled down. [[6721 旁白 neutral]]
Damn it, this godforsaken place of Kempfa suddenly erupted with two Forbidden Spell-level energy fluctuations, and one of them was the Scarlet Moon recorded in the archives. Even if he was a bishop of a great city, facing such a scene, which he wouldn't see many times in his life, he couldn't help but wipe sweat from his brow. [[6722 旁白 neutral]]
But no matter what, since it had happened, and in a town under Roland City's jurisdiction, he, as the Bishop, had an undeniable responsibility. [[6723 旁白 neutral]]
"Wait!" [[6724 陌生女1 neutral]]
The nun still wanted to persuade him, but the old man was eager to act. Just then, the sky, completely taken over by blue and red, suddenly changed. Both of them stopped pulling and stared at the scene in shock. [[6725 旁白 surprised]]
The turbulent water suddenly became extremely gentle. It slowly expanded with an embracing posture, and the encroaching red no longer showed the violent struggle of a dying counterattack. It calmly accepted the water's assimilation. [[6726 旁白 neutral]]
"The Water Element is devouring..." [[6727 陌生女1 surprised]]
The nun couldn't help but exclaim, but the old man abruptly cut her off. [[6728 旁白 neutral]]
"No!" [[6729 主教 neutral]]
"That's not devouring, it's embracing." [[6730 主教 neutral]]
The old man's voice was no longer hoarse but as deep as a bronze bell. His hunched body, standing there, seemed to straighten up instantly. [[6731 旁白 neutral]]
The nun frowned in confusion, but the Bishop's gaze became incredibly serious at this moment. [[6732 旁白 neutral]]
"Devouring must be accompanied by painful struggles, while embracing is as natural and peaceful as a mother holding her child in her arms to nurse." [[6733 主教 neutral]]
Despite his composed appearance, the old man was so excited internally that he almost blurted out words like "Whose subordinate is this?" Fortunately, his years in high positions had given him good self-restraint, and he managed to suppress this impulse. [[6734 旁白 neutral]]
"Your Grace, the situation has changed. Regarding Her Royal Highness, the Saintess..." [[6735 陌生女1 neutral]]
"The plan remains unchanged. I will still go personally." [[6736 主教 neutral]]
After he finished speaking, Eleanor felt as if the Bishop had thrown something stick-shaped at her. She instinctively caught it, and looking down at her hand, she saw the exquisite patterns, luxurious luster, and the full-colored ruby inlaid at the very top of the staff—it was the Bishop's staff. [[6737 旁白 neutral]]
The nun was startled. She was about to look up and ask further questions when she saw that the place where the Bishop had been standing by the bell tower railing was now empty. [[6738 旁白 surprised]]
... [[6739 旁白 neutral]]
... [[6740 旁白 neutral]]
The terrifying elemental storm suddenly dissipated. Vlad felt the external pressure on the barrier suddenly lessen, and a glint of light flashed in his blood-colored eyes. [[6741 旁白 neutral]]
Finally, a winner has been decided, he thought. [[6742 弗拉德 neutral]]
The clash of two Forbidden Spell-level powers, and at such close range, would have been challenging even for him alone, let alone after consuming a large amount of blood to perform the embrace ceremony for the Wind Saintess. [[6743 旁白 neutral]]
Vlad admitted that this plan had gone a little beyond his expectations, but only a little! [[6744 旁白 neutral]]
He, Vlad Bathory, the noble Demon Clan Duke, the powerful Sixth-Order Archdemon, whose every action and gesture garnered external attention, and whose every utterance could stir up great influence in the Demon World, or even the entire continent. [[6745 旁白 neutral]]
He was perfect, powerful, the offspring who inherited the purest bloodline and wisdom of his benevolent father! [[6746 旁白 neutral]]
How could he fail in such a godforsaken little place?! [[6747 弗拉德 angry]]
Besides, his plan was already largely successful. [[6748 旁白 neutral]]
The girl bound on the cross had completely lost her color. Her originally healthy and fair skin was now even paler, but this paleness was especially jarring, a sickly, paper-like paleness. [[6749 旁白 sad]]
The girl's green long hair had also entirely turned silver-white, and her cherry-like lips were as crimson as if painted with fresh blood. The temperature rapidly fled from her body, signaling that this once pure Saintess was about to forever lose her human identity. [[6750 旁白 sad]]
The Embrace Ceremony was almost complete. After all, a Saintess was a Saintess, and special care had to be taken with her soul's baptism. As long as her soul was completely assimilated and controlled, no matter the outcome below, he would be the winner. [[6751 旁白 neutral]]
It was merely a difference between a grand victory and an ultra-grand victory. [[6752 旁白 neutral]]
However, he still needed to pay attention and see whether that Duchess Cayetana was still sharp as ever, or if the unexpected variable that suddenly appeared had won. [[6753 旁白 neutral]]
So, he looked down... [[6754 旁白 neutral]]
The blood-blue vortex, from its previous conflict to its fusion, saw the two forces that had expanded like hot air shrink more and more, until finally, the ravaged earth was revealed, and in the very center of the energy vortex, a streak of crimson. [[6755 旁白 neutral]]
It was Cayetana who won... [[6756 弗拉德 neutral]]
Vlad was about to gracefully deliver his conclusion like a superior, but his relaxed brow suddenly furrowed at that moment. [[6757 旁白 surprised]]
"Counterattack!" [[6758 弗拉德 surprised]]
