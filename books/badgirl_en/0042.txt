Chapter 42 Reset 42 Enemy of All Living Things [[2411 旁白 neutral]]
    "Water Saintess, I admit I can't break your power, but that doesn't mean you can kill me. I bet you would never dare, and never could, lay a hand on me." [[2412 克格萨 angry]]
    Kogsa's wild laughter echoed in their ears. Serenia frowned but didn't stand in front of Loberia again. Under the shade of the ancient tree of life, she was trying her best to recover her body's dried-up magic power. [[2413 旁白 neutral]]
    In her opinion, Loberia could only extend the duration of this battle as much as possible, not decide its outcome. But that was completely enough; as long as they delayed for enough time for her to recover some strength, the success rate of protecting her and retreating together would greatly increase. [[2414 旁白 neutral]]
    As for reinforcements, Serenia didn't dare to wish for too much. Craigmore Wasteland, where they were, was originally a buffer zone between the Empire and the Demon Realm. The Empire's border guards, upon noticing the large movement of demons, would immediately decide to guard and hold the border, rather than sending troops forward. [[2415 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, this time, the assassination oracle sent by the Ice God was carried out secretly. The Empire, unaware of the specific situation, would never act rashly. [[2416 旁白 neutral]]
    By the time the Church received the information and made a decision, it would most likely be too late. [[2417 旁白 neutral]]
    As for the Demon Realm, it was uncertain. Once the Demon Realm sent reinforcements first and directly sealed off and surrounded the area around the "Non-aggression Pact," it would be difficult to break out. [[2418 旁白 fearful]]
    Kogsa, unable to do anything to the two of them, still didn't choose to retreat, probably because he had this plan in mind. [[2419 旁白 neutral]]
    Kogsa, who had been frustrated repeatedly, covered his face with one hand and laughed wildly, looking up at the sky. Even though damage and bloodshed were absolutely forbidden on the battlefield, the malice emanating from a Great Demon still made people's hair stand on end, even from dozens of meters away. [[2420 旁白 fearful]]
    However, Loberia remained calm, as if oblivious to the situation. Her mismatched golden and blue eyes seemed to contain a strange power, and the "existence" of the world reflected differently in her eyes. [[2421 旁白 neutral]]
    "Again, do you really want to be my enemy?" [[2422 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    She asked again, her gentle voice becoming heavy, like a kind mother giving a final chance to a mischievous child who refused to change. [[2423 旁白 neutral]]
    The Ritual Holy Sword in the girl's arms glowed with a clear, moist sheen. A faint light illuminated the divine patterns engraved on the sword, as if an ancient ritual was beginning. [[2424 旁白 neutral]]
    "Stop pretending, Water Saintess, you simply..." [[2425 克格萨 angry]]
    His crimson Hellish Eyes were consumed by madness. He stretched out a hand to point at the blue-haired girl in front of him, intending to mock her, but before he could finish, the last few words seemed to get stuck in his throat, unable to be uttered. [[2426 旁白 fearful]]
    Along with an unconscious, noticeable tremor throughout his body, all his muscles stiffened at this moment. His Adam's apple desperately moved, but he was like a stranded fish, with only endless suffocation pouring in. Blood vessels even burst in his eyeballs. With almost all his strength, he finally managed to turn his eyes and saw a corner of the problem... [[2427 旁白 fearful]]
    He saw dense plants wriggling, countless insects flying everywhere, and jackals, tigers, leopards, wild boars, and brown bears rushing from all directions, raising dust that covered the sky. Even tons of elephants followed behind... [[2428 旁白 fearful]]
    Wait, why? [[2429 克格萨 surprised]]
    Why did he suddenly feel so much hostility? [[2430 克格萨 surprised]]
    Why was his heart beating so fast? [[2431 克格萨 surprised]]
    And that indescribable suffocating feeling still pressing down on him, this feeling, it was as if... [[2432 克格萨 fearful]]
    He lifted his head against the pressure and looked up at the sky. The blazing sun hanging high above seemed to particularly favor him, its golden needle-like strong light burning his flesh like golden flames. [[2433 旁白 fearful]]
    The ground beneath his feet became unusually prickly, and the colorless, odorless air felt like an invisible hand squeezing his neck. His blood boiled uncontrollably, and moisture rapidly escaped and evaporated from his body surface... [[2434 旁白 fearful]]
    Throughout this process, a small part of his spiritual power remained firmly fixed on Loberia. Even though he was suffering a fate worse than death from this strange situation, what was even harder to understand was that the Water Saintess, the only possible culprit, showed no hint of killing intent. [[2435 旁白 neutral]]
    She stood there consistently, her eyes as clear as water, as tranquil and peaceful as when he first saw her. [[2436 旁白 neutral]]
    Yes, this boundless pain of being rejected and excluded by the world... wasn't this the Water Saintess's doing? [[2437 克格萨 surprised]]
    No, this is impossible! [[2438 克格萨 angry]]
    Within the scope of the "Non-aggression Pact," only the Water Saintess had the right to make the first move. But once the Water Saintess made the first move, he would also be free to kill without any restrictions. In terms of raw strength, neither of the two Saintesses was his match now, and he was waiting for this opportunity. [[2439 旁白 neutral]]
    Initially, when his body felt a sense of danger out of nowhere, Kogsa thought the opportunity he had been eagerly waiting for had arrived. But his throat, as if constricted, still couldn't produce a single sound. The desire to fight was suppressed by a divine seal, completely unable to send effective commands to his limbs. [[2440 旁白 fearful]]
    This meant that the "Non-aggression Pact" was still active, but he was clearly under attack! [[2441 克格萨 fearful]]
    "What... trick did you play?!" [[2442 克格萨 angry]]
    In the eyes of the enraged animals, Kogsa was an enemy invading their territory, a presence that must be driven away. Amidst rolling smoke, the beasts were already halfway there, but closest to Kogsa were the plants at his feet. Brown thorns had already climbed his ankles, wrapping around half of his body. [[2443 旁白 fearful]]
    Overwhelmed, Kogsa knelt on the ground, his hands constantly tearing at the weak and annoying things in his eyes. [[2444 旁白 fearful]]
    The emerald green vines, not to be outdone, like competitive children, tightly bound his flesh with their tough bodies. Flowers and grass rooted and grew in his armor and skin wounds, and an endless supply of life force was drawn from his powerful body, serving as nourishment for the thriving plants. [[2445 旁白 fearful]]
    "I've already given you a chance." [[2446 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The blue-haired girl calmly watched all this unfold. After hearing Kogsa's fragmented questions, she first seemingly tiredly closed her eyes. When she opened them again, the tranquility in them had entirely turned into pity for the life that was about to vanish. [[2447 旁白 sad]]
    "Impossible... even a powerful... forbidden spell, must have its flaws... or, a price!" [[2448 克格萨 angry]]
    "Why? You can kill me... but I can't kill you!" [[2449 克格萨 angry]]
    This was the answer Kogsa wanted most. Demons did not fear death, but even if he died, he had to understand the true reason before his death. This was his last dignity as a Great Demon. [[2450 旁白 neutral]]
    He absolutely could not die in confusion! [[2451 克格萨 angry]]
    "Because I never thought of killing you." [[2452 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Loberia sighed softly, her voice as calm as water. [[2453 旁白 neutral]]
    She truly had never harbored any killing intent, not even a trace. [[2454 旁白 neutral]]
    As for why Kogsa had fallen into such a situation? [[2455 旁白 neutral]]
    The answer, hadn't she already told him long ago? [[2456 旁白 neutral]]
    Do you want to be my enemy? [[2457 旁白 neutral]]
    This very sentence was the root of everything. [[2458 旁白 neutral]]
    As for a simpler, clearer explanation, it was probably that small new entry after the Holy Sword was unsealed—"Those who raise blades against the mercy of God shall be chained by the blades of all spirits." [[2459 旁白 neutral]]
