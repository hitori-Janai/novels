Chapter 91: The Seal [[5152 旁白 neutral]]
The bronze gate was opened, and the scent of decay deepened once more. [[5153 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone held burning Bible pages in their hands, staying close together, and orderly walked into this cold and unfamiliar space. [[5154 旁白 neutral]]
The world behind the bronze gate was not as vast as everyone had imagined. Calculated by the boundaries of darkness, the space here was only as large as a church hall. It seemed this place was merely a sealing ground, and no fierce battles had occurred before the sealing. [[5155 旁白 neutral]]
Golden flames dispelled the darkness, allowing everyone to see the path ahead and... a pool embedded in the ground. The water in the pool seemed still, and in this cold, decaying, and damp underground, no algae or other decaying substances grew in the stagnant water. [[5156 旁白 neutral]]
Even with the firelight shining on the surface of the pool, the water quality still appeared faintly dark. The light could not penetrate the dark water to illuminate the bottom, but it still revealed some things lurking on the surface. [[5157 旁白 neutral]]
“This is... a chain.” [[5158 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella tried to extend the cross spear in her hand into the water. The silver tip of the spear touched the chains submerged in the water, producing a metallic clang upon contact. [[5159 旁白 neutral]]
Everyone saw clearly that deep beneath the water, chains as thick as an arm were engraved with dense, ancient inscriptions. When the spear touched them, the previously dull inscriptions glowed with starlight. [[5160 旁白 neutral]]
Beneath the water, an unnamed tremor arose, causing countless ripples to appear on the calm surface. However, this tremor was not severe because the seal applied here had not loosened; it was still firmly suppressing her power. [[5161 旁白 neutral]]
Even after thousands of years, she remained immortal, but this seal was like a natural restraint on her. If she was immortal, the seal would also last forever. [[5162 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, as the inscriptions on the chains exerted their power, the tremor subsided, and the underground space returned to quiet, as if the previous anomaly had never occurred. [[5163 旁白 neutral]]
“Can you understand anything?” [[5164 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre, holding a burning page from the Bible, turned and asked the three girls behind him. [[5165 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella frowned tightly. Clearly, she saw that this thing was extraordinary, but she could not decipher the inner meaning of the inscriptions. She could only sense the elemental fluctuations at the bottom of the pool based on her Archmage level. [[5166 旁白 neutral]]
“Such dense dark elements, and these are just faint elements floating on the surface, overflowing outside the seal. If the seal were opened, the consequences would be unimaginable.” [[5167 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
Facing a powerful enemy that had lived for thousands of years, even Isabella, as a Saint Nun, dared not be careless. [[5168 旁白 neutral]]
“'Starfall Annihilation' and... 'Crimson Moon Eternal Punishment'...” [[5169 墨莺 neutral]]
Isabella's inability to see did not mean others couldn't. Mo Ying, who believed she had done an excellent job of keeping her identity a secret, saw the inscriptions on the chains by the light and read them out softly. [[5170 旁白 neutral]]
“You can read it?” [[5171 安德烈 surprised]]
Although Andre's tone was questioning, his face showed no surprise. [[5172 旁白 neutral]]
After all, she was a dignified Saintess. Isn't it reasonable for her to know a bit more than what ordinary people know? [[5173 旁白 neutral]]
“Yes, I learned some from ancient books... These inscriptions on the chains are ancient symbols from thousands of years ago. Some belong to werewolf culture, and some to witch culture. But both civilizations have now vanished. Such words and symbols are mostly only seen on ancient stone tablets. I didn't expect to see them with my own eyes today...” [[5174 墨莺 neutral]]
Mo Ying explained, her bright eyes fixed on the inscriptions on the chains, and she began to translate and explain them to everyone. [[5175 旁白 neutral]]
“These chains record the method by which the Wolf King and the Witch jointly sealed Duke Cayetana back then.” [[5176 墨莺 neutral]]
“Duke Cayetana, that should be the surname of the sealed Bloodline Grand Duke, right?” [[5177 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella asked curiously, but then seemed to recall something and sharply changed the subject. [[5178 旁白 neutral]]
“Wait, Witch? Wasn't it Sorceress?” [[5179 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella clearly remembered that in the town's history Andre told her about, it was the Wolf King and the Sorceress who sealed the vampire, leaving their descendants to guard the place. [[5180 旁白 neutral]]
Why did the Sorceress suddenly become a Witch? [[5181 旁白 surprised]]
At this moment, Seraphina, who had been silently following behind, spoke. [[5182 旁白 neutral]]
“'Witch' is an honorific for some legendary high-level sorceresses, just as the young lady just said, it's not simply a werewolf, but the Wolf King.” [[5183 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“A Bloodline Grand Duke's rank is at least Sixth Tier, which is almost the world's top combat power. Plus the Bloodline's inherent immortality, ordinary werewolves and sorceresses would find it very difficult to defeat her...” [[5184 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
“Seraphina is right. To seal a Sixth-Tier Bloodline Grand Duke, it naturally required the Wolf King and the Witch, who were also Fifth-Tier. Even so, these two powerful beings in their respective races still paid a terrible price to gain the opportunity to seal the Bloodline.” [[5185 墨莺 neutral]]
Mo Ying nodded, confirming the accuracy of Seraphina's explanation, and then continued to translate for everyone. [[5186 旁白 neutral]]
“The inscriptions record the method and names of the two seals used by the Wolf King and the Witch to seal the Bloodline Grand Duke. Due to the Bloodline's immortality, even the Wolf King, the Bloodline's natural nemesis, could not completely kill a Bloodline Grand Duke. Ordinary seals were not very effective against a Bloodline Grand Duke. Once a seal had a flaw and was broken, the consequences would be unimaginable, so...” [[5187 墨莺 neutral]]
“That Witch and Wolf King came up with a method: to use two different sealing techniques to seal the Bloodline Grand Duke's body and soul separately. As long as the soul cannot return to the body, even if the Bloodline Grand Duke has earth-shattering abilities, they won't be able to exert even one-tenth of their power.” [[5188 墨莺 neutral]]
Andre listened intently, and he couldn't help but feel admiration for these otherworldly beings from thousands of years ago. To be able to devise such a method, they truly were powerful beings respected in their respective races. [[5189 旁白 neutral]]
“In ancient times, werewolves symbolized the moon. Whenever there was a full moon, the werewolves' power would multiply. So the Wolf King used 'Crimson Moon Eternal Punishment,' symbolizing the moon, to seal the Bloodline Grand Duke's body. The witch clan excels at astrology, and their totems have always had star symbols. So that Witch used 'Starfall Annihilation,' symbolizing the stars, to seal the Bloodline Grand Duke's soul.” [[5190 墨莺 neutral]]
“Since then, a Sixth-Tier Bloodline Grand Duke's soul and body were sealed separately. The soul could not return to the body, and the body could not regain the soul, forever bound by this punishment.” [[5191 墨莺 neutral]]
“...” [[5192 旁白 neutral]]
Mo Ying finished translating most of the content recorded on the chains' inscriptions, and the air fell into an eerie silence. [[5193 旁白 neutral]]
After a long time, Isabella finally let out a long breath. [[5194 旁白 neutral]]
“It's truly hard to imagine how tragic that war thousands of years ago must have been. Two Fifth-Tier powerhouses teamed up to seal a Sixth-Tier one, and even with the racial advantage, they still paid an irreversible and terrible price...” [[5195 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
As is well known, the transcendent powers of the Nephalem Continent are divided into seven tiers, increasing from the First Tier to the Seventh Tier. The first and second tiers are considered the entry levels for each profession or path. The third and fourth tiers are the most numerous and important backbone forces in every major organization. [[5196 旁白 neutral]]
Like Isabella and Seraphina, the Fourth Tier is almost the limit that ordinary people without special bloodlines but with talent can reach. At the Fourth Tier, mages can summon elemental domains, and warriors can open their own life auras... [[5197 旁白 neutral]]
In short, Fourth-Tier extraordinaries are already omnipotent beings in the eyes of ordinary people, capable of destroying the world like deities. As for the Fifth and Sixth Tiers, those are the leaders in major organizations, such as Saintesses, Popes, Archdemons, Bloodline Dukes... [[5198 旁白 neutral]]
In summary, the Sixth Tier is almost the pinnacle of transcendent power. Why is the Sixth Tier considered the pinnacle of transcendent power? [[5199 旁白 neutral]]
Because the legendary Seventh Tier, the power mastered by those who reach that level can no longer be called transcendent, because they themselves have transformed into terrifying half-human, half-god beings. The power they wield is no longer extraordinary, but almost divine miracles on par with gods! [[5200 旁白 neutral]]
P.S.: Sorry, I had a minor surgery these past few days, so it's a bit inconvenient to move around. The updates from the past few days were all drafts. Today, I really have no drafts left. I gathered my energy tonight and managed to write two chapters, counting as the update for the 3rd. I'll take a day off on the 2nd and make it up after I recover. [[5201 旁白 neutral]]
