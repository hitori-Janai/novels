Chapter 90: Preparation [[5090 旁白 neutral]]

It was late at night, and most of the town's residents were fast asleep. [[5091 旁白 neutral]]
Even the ascetic nuns had returned to their rooms. The cellar entrance was in a corner of the church's backyard, a place that was always dark and damp. Even the nuns who had lived there for a long time mostly avoided it. [[5092 旁白 neutral]]
Just by coming here, everyone inexplicably felt an invisible sense of foreboding, and this feeling grew even stronger as the darkness nourished it. [[5093 旁白 fearful]]
Isabella held her cross spear, subtly shielding Mo Ying behind her, while Seraphina followed directly behind the young girl. The short, sharp twin blades in her hand were the strongest defense behind the young lady, and only now did Mo Ying's hidden identity as the Wind Saintess vaguely show its signs. [[5094 旁白 neutral]]
To be personally protected by two Fourth-Tier powerhouses, such treatment could probably only be enjoyed by someone of equal status to a Saintess, right? [[5095 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Andrei, please." [[5096 墨莺 neutral]]
Mo Ying's voice sounded. The man in the white coat nodded. He took out the two keys, one gold and one silver, from his pocket, then bent down and gently placed his palm on the damp ground. [[5097 旁白 neutral]]
His lips moved, softly chanting a spell. [[5098 旁白 neutral]]
The ancient spell echoed in the quiet environment. Immediately, the ground where the man's hand touched twisted. The change was like a color block on a painting being washed by water, colors mixing together until the feeling of going from real to unreal completely shattered. [[5099 旁白 neutral]]
A simple square wooden door embedded in the ground appeared before everyone's eyes. [[5100 旁白 neutral]]
How to say it, upon seeing this wooden door, everyone except Andrei felt more or less surprised. The legendary place used to seal the Blood Duke was separated by a simple wooden door? [[5101 旁白 surprised]]
This was impossible to imagine. [[5102 旁白 neutral]]
As expected, the man didn't even use the keys. He just reached out and pulled a recess on the wooden door, and the door opened. A cold wind blew out from it. Even though everyone accompanying them had magic protection, they still shivered more or less, or got goosebumps. [[5103 旁白 fearful]]
"Come on." [[5104 安德烈 neutral]]
Andrei held up the pre-prepared torch, stepped onto the ladder, and was the first to enter. [[5105 旁白 neutral]]
The light, which had not been seen for a long time in the dark environment, immediately brought with it a gloomy, damp, and decaying smell that entered their nostrils. Their bodies instinctively felt uncomfortable, but fortunately, the man's body was still strong. He only felt slightly uncomfortable when he first entered and had fully adapted by the time he finished climbing the ladder and felt his feet on solid ground. [[5106 旁白 neutral]]
With the first person descending, there were naturally the second and third. Isabella, who was protecting Mo Ying in front, naturally became the second without hesitation, and Mo Ying, uncharacteristically, did not decline, only offering encouragement and blessings with her eyes. [[5107 旁白 neutral]]
"Clack." [[5108 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella's leather shoes echoed far and deep as she stepped onto the ground. She first checked her surroundings, then looked at the expressionless man holding the torch. [[5109 旁白 neutral]]
"It's full of that awful smell everywhere here. Don't you feel uncomfortable?" [[5110 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"No." [[5111 安德烈 neutral]]
The man shook his head, but Isabella only took it as him pretending to be strong. She believed no one would want to inhale such foul-smelling air, carrying the stench of long-dead decaying corpses. It was simply torture. [[5112 旁白 neutral]]
If they weren't all holy practitioners with magical protection, ordinary people breathing such air for a prolonged period would likely be poisoned. [[5113 旁白 neutral]]
She motioned for the two people still on the ground to come down, but Andrei had already walked into the depths of the darkness, holding the torch. [[5114 旁白 neutral]]
Andrei wasn't lying; the smell here was indeed unpleasant, but similarly, the air was extremely humid. A large amount of unseen water elements were scattered in every corner of the darkness, making his senses exceptionally sharp. [[5115 旁白 neutral]]
Although he was still in a male body and had not activated his divine blood, the transformation and effect of divine blood on the body were not limited to the female form. Although Andrei didn't have much talent for magic, in terms of affinity, both ice and water elements were certainly outstanding. [[5116 旁白 neutral]]
From the water, he sensed that deep in the darkness, there was still another door. Only by opening that door would the truth buried beneath this ancient land welcome them. [[5117 旁白 neutral]]
The people behind quickly caught up, following the torchlight. [[5118 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey, Andrei, why are you running so fast? In an unfamiliar environment, don't go off alone!" [[5119 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"Mr. Andrei, did you find anything?" [[5120 墨莺 neutral]]
The two voices appeared one after another. Without looking back, just by listening to the address and tone, one could tell who said which. [[5121 旁白 neutral]]
Andrei did not respond, but simply raised the torch higher, illuminating what was before them. [[5122 旁白 neutral]]
It was a heavy bronze door, covered with a thick layer of verdigris, but this did not prevent the newcomers from observing the patterns carved on the bronze door. [[5123 旁白 neutral]]
A full moon, countless stars, a wolf king galloping across the grassland, a human female holding a magic staff gazing at the starry sky, a magnificent castle, and a shadow almost covering the entire picture... [[5124 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems that this cellar does indeed seal some things related to those years, after all..." [[5125 旁白 neutral]]
The elements of wolves, witches, blood races, and ancient castles engraved on the murals corresponded one by one with the stories told in the records, almost proving that Andrei's conjecture was correct. [[5126 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, the truth still had to be seen with their own eyes. As long as this bronze door was opened, the past of a thousand years would be revealed before them. [[5127 旁白 neutral]]
"Everyone, are you ready?" [[5128 安德烈 neutral]]
Andrei took out the two keys from his pocket again and turned his head to look behind him. [[5129 旁白 neutral]]
Mo Ying, protected in the center by the two nuns, nodded with determined eyes. [[5130 墨莺 neutral]]
"Mr. Andrei, please open the door." [[5131 墨莺 neutral]]
As the gold and silver keys were inserted into the two opposing keyholes of the bronze door, and the keys were turned simultaneously, the ancient mechanisms embedded in the door began to operate again. Sand and stone were shaken off by the movement of the bronze door, and the bronze door slowly opened from the center. [[5132 旁白 neutral]]
Cold wind poured out from the newly opened gap, and the torch in Andrei's hand flickered, about to extinguish. [[5133 旁白 fearful]]
In the darkness, once the light source was lost, people would fall into uncontrolled fear. But Andrei, as if prepared, took out a few more pages from his pocket. The almost extinguished flame on the torch ignited these papers. [[5134 旁白 neutral]]
A stable golden flame was ignited, emitting a reassuring light. [[5135 旁白 neutral]]
"This is... a page from the Bible?" [[5136 墨莺 surprised]]
Mo Ying recognized the item Andrei had lit at a glance. [[5137 旁白 neutral]]
Andrei distributed a few chapters of the Bible pages, lit them separately, and handed them to the three girls behind him. [[5138 旁白 neutral]]
"Supply your magic to the flame, so the Bible pages won't be completely burned out." [[5139 安德烈 neutral]]
"You don't need to tell us, we already know..." [[5140 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella, who had just taken the Bible page, was about to complain about Andrei's long-windedness when she felt a light source behind her extinguish. [[5141 旁白 surprised]]
Turning her head, she saw Seraphina staring at the Bible page that had turned to ash in her hand, tilting her head slightly in a bewildered manner. [[5142 旁白 surprised]]
"Sorry, mine... seems to have burned out." [[5143 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Isabella, who was instantly proven wrong, completely shut her mouth. [[5144 旁白 neutral]]
"Unfortunately, I don't have any extra ones." [[5145 安德烈 neutral]]
Andrei also held out his hand. [[5146 旁白 neutral]]
"It's okay, Seraphina and I can share one." [[5147 墨莺 happy]]
Mo Ying raised the burning Bible page in her hand, and at the same time, affectionately took Seraphina's hand. [[5148 旁白 happy]]
Andrei glanced at the lesbian couple, who were constantly emitting a "lily" scent, as if silently complaining with his eyes. [[5149 旁白 neutral]]
"Let's go. Next, it's time to face the real challenge." [[5150 安德烈 neutral]]
