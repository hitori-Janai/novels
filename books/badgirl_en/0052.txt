Chapter 52: Sister Evelyn's Daily Routine [[2984 旁白 neutral]]
The next morning, as the first light of dawn cut through the edge of the night's curtain. [[2985 旁白 neutral]]
Lobelia appeared early in the main hall of the church, facing the statue of the Wind God, her hands clasped and her eyes lowered in prayer. [[2986 旁白 neutral]]
Praying to the god every day was her duty as a nun. [[2987 旁白 neutral]]
Whenever she did this, Lobelia's spirit would sink into an indescribable state of stillness. What she saw with her eyes closed was no longer the void and darkness that ordinary people feel, but her consciousness seemed to wander in a vast and ethereal place of meditation. [[2988 旁白 neutral]]
A hopeful light filled every corner of this space. No matter how she adjusted the direction of her consciousness, seven mysterious pillars of light always stood before her. The pillars were of different colors, and three of them had a close connection to her. [[2989 旁白 neutral]]
The pale white pillar of light gave off an indescribable sense of solemnity. Moving slightly closer, she could feel a clear sense of stagnation, as if the spread of light and the passage of time slowed down upon touching its existence. [[2990 旁白 neutral]]
The emerald green pillar of light seemed to have a life of its own, constantly breathing outwards. Approaching it caused no discomfort; instead, it brought a comforting sensation of being enveloped and caressed by a fluid, much like soaking in a bathtub. [[2991 旁白 neutral]]
As for the sea-blue pillar of light, it was the most special. When she got close... [[2992 旁白 neutral]]
Her deep meditation was suddenly broken. Lobelia automatically withdrew from that mystical state, and as she opened her eyes, she clearly sensed a familiar person standing behind her. [[2993 旁白 surprised]]
Turning around, she met a pair of beautiful golden-brown eyes. [[2994 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella's eyes widened slightly in surprise, and then a faint look of guilt appeared on her face. [[2995 旁白 neutral]]
"Sorry, did I disturb you? I tried my best to walk quietly, but I didn't expect..." [[2996 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
Unlike when she was with Father Andre, when Isabella was with Sister Evelyn, she would habitually hide some of the cunning in her personality. Her expression, tone, and attitude would all unconsciously become much more sincere. [[2997 旁白 neutral]]
Through eye contact, Lobelia could tell that the other person wasn't lying; the emotion in her eyes was genuine. [[2998 旁白 neutral]]
But even if Isabella had lied, she wouldn't blame her, because forgiving the mistakes of others was one of the instincts engraved in her very being. [[2999 旁白 neutral]]
What's more, right now, Isabella wasn't lying, so she had even less reason to blame her. [[3000 旁白 neutral]]
"It's alright, Sister Isabella, you didn't disturb me. It just so happened that my prayer time was over, so you don't need to apologize." [[3001 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Is that so?" [[3002 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
A smile returned to Isabella's face. She affectionately took the other's hands, and her faint guilt instantly vanished. [[3003 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella was truly fond of this young nun named Evelyn. Otherwise, with her lazy personality, she wouldn't have woken up until the sun was high in the sky. She came to the church so early today just to see the face she had been longing for. [[3004 旁白 happy]]
Braving the morning dew, she saw the devout and beautiful figure under the statue as soon as she reached the church door. [[3005 旁白 neutral]]
The morning light shone on her through the church's stained-glass windows. Light and shadow intertwined, yet they didn't create a sense of sharp contrast. The two opposing elements were neutralized by the girl's special aura, like a gentle mother soothing two children with different personalities with her love. [[3006 旁白 neutral]]
Standing beneath the statue was not a devout nun, but a holy mother whose radiance could rival that of a god. [[3007 旁白 neutral]]
This scene was so sacred that Isabella, who was standing at the door waiting for Evelyn to finish her prayers, couldn't help but hold her breath and walk into the church. [[3008 旁白 neutral]]
A little closer, a little closer... [[3009 旁白 neutral]]
That was the only voice left in her heart at that moment. It wasn't until she was standing behind the girl and Evelyn turned around that this sacred and peaceful scene was broken. [[3010 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella swore that she had only ever felt this from two people in her life. One was the Evelyn in front of her, and the other was... [[3011 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm also very happy that the second person I saw this morning was Sister Isabella." [[3012 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
"Is that so~? Ah~ Little sister Evelyn's 'sister' is going to melt my heart~" [[3013 伊莎贝拉 happy]]
A faint blush appeared on Isabella's cheeks, but she quickly seemed to catch on to something important, her eyebrows raised slightly. [[3014 旁白 surprised]]
"Darn it, I'm only the second one? Which bastard stole little sister Evelyn's precious first time?" [[3015 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
"It was Father Andre. The Father was the first to arrive at the church. I happened to see him finishing up and rushing out as I came in." [[3016 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia seemed completely unaware of Isabella's bold words and just answered seriously. [[3017 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh... so it was him? Then there's no problem. Ever since the old priest left and the priest went to the Roland Cathedral to be on standby, he's the one who gets up the earliest every day in the entire church." [[3018 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
The gray-haired nun looked as if she had expected this. [[3019 旁白 neutral]]
"Is the Father always this busy?" [[3020 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Busy? He is busy, but who knows what he's busy with all day. He always looks so carefree, and even when the church is busy, it doesn't stop him from peeking at the nuns' thighs." [[3021 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
With Andre not around, Isabella seemed to have let go of some restraint and complained fiercely. [[3022 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh... so, is that what Father Andre is like in Sister Isabella's eyes?" [[3023 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
The girl rested her index finger on her lower lip, lost in thought. [[3024 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahem... I'm not saying Father Andre is a bad person. Although he likes to peek at people's thighs, he's quite reliable when it matters. And his attitude towards the townspeople is impeccable. In my opinion, he's much more reliable than those arrogant young priests from the big cathedrals." [[3025 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella rarely spoke ill of Andre, her expression serious. [[3026 旁白 neutral]]
"Is that so? If Sister Isabella says so, then it must be true." [[3027 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
The blue-haired nun smiled, and her smile was so dazzling that Isabella was momentarily captivated. [[3028 旁白 neutral]]
The atmosphere suddenly became a little strange, until John's rooster crowed on time, and the sounds of conversations and footsteps of the townspeople gradually came from outside the church. [[3029 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahem... it looks like the relaxing time is over. Evelyn, are you ready for today's work?" [[3030 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella looked at the shadowy figures gradually becoming clearer outside the church door and turned to the girl with a smile, holding out her hand. [[3031 旁白 neutral]]
Lobelia firmly took her hand and nodded gently. [[3032 旁白 neutral]]
"Of course. May the wind... carve our path." [[3033 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
... [[3034 旁白 neutral]]
As the residents poured in, the once quiet little church suddenly became lively. [[3035 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella, along with a few newly arrived nuns, maintained order at the door. The pews were filled with believers waiting to enter the confessional. [[3036 旁白 neutral]]
"Everyone, please line up in order. Follow the numbers on your confession slips and don't cut in line." [[3037 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella handed over the task of maintaining order at the door to the other nuns and stood at the entrance of the confessional, repeating the instructions while checking and collecting the confession slips from the believers. [[3038 旁白 neutral]]
Inside the confessional, the light was dim, but the middle-aged man sitting in the seat felt as if he were basking in the spring sun. He trembled with excitement as he gazed at the girl who seemed like an angel descended to earth, his throat moving. [[3039 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss Evelyn, we... we finally meet again!" [[3040 卡特先生 happy]]
"Mr. Carter, don't be nervous." [[3041 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia reached out and lightly touched the man's rough, trembling hand. Her azure eyes shone with a light of kindness and tolerance. [[3042 旁白 neutral]]
"Right now, it's just you and me here..." [[3043 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Please tell me all your troubles, confusion, and doubts. Do not be afraid of the unknown, because I am here. The eyes of the god are upon us, and the god will forgive our sins. May the grace of the Wind God be with you." [[3044 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
