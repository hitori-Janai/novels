Chapter 131: True Form [[8070 旁白 neutral]]
    As night fell, a bush along the path was cleared and leveled. Collected dry branches were stacked, and orange-red flames danced, crackling as they burned. [[8071 旁白 neutral]]
    Outside the tent, by the bonfire, the air filled with the scent of food. Appetizing oil shimmered on the surface of the bubbling, boiling soup. [[8072 旁白 neutral]]
    "Miss, please have your meal first." [[8073 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Uh, thank you." [[8074 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Luo Beiliya took the thick vegetable soup the young girl offered. After a moment of hesitation, she nodded in thanks. Thick steam rose from the soup bowl, blurring the girl's busy figure, but it couldn't hide the diligent aura she gave off. [[8075 旁白 neutral]]
    When Seraphina also sat down with a bowl of soup opposite the bonfire, Luo Beiliya took a sip of the fragrant broth before looking up and speaking. [[8076 旁白 neutral]]
    "Actually, you don't have to be so formal. When we're together, you can just call me by my name. Luo Beiliya might not always be appropriate, but you can call me Evelyn. Your sister always calls me that too." [[8077 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Three days had passed since they left Kempfa Town. During these three days, to avoid attracting attention and leaving obvious traces, they had almost always slept outdoors like today. However, unlike ordinary adventurers who had to do everything themselves, Luo Beiliya enjoyed the treatment of a young lady. Seraphina was incredibly diligent, skilled in everything from changing faces and disguises to washing clothes, cooking, and even intricate tasks like braiding hair. [[8078 旁白 neutral]]
    Luo Beiliya, who had never enjoyed such treatment, felt as if she had returned to her days as the young master of the family. The maids who served her back then were similar, but none were as thorough as Seraphina. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been implanted with the Succubus Seed at home. [[8079 旁白 neutral]]
    In short, the previous maids provided mechanical service for wages and their servitude, without any real feelings. Seraphina, however, truly treated her as a respected master, attending to her every need. This made Luo Beiliya, who had never experienced such honor, feel a little uncomfortable. [[8080 旁白 neutral]]
    "Okay, Miss." [[8081 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina nodded seriously, seemingly accepting her suggestion, but in reality, she still did as she pleased. [[8082 旁白 neutral]]
    "You really don't need to be so polite. Although I accepted your young lady's request and agreed to keep you with me, we haven't signed a soul contract, so it's not a master-servant relationship. It's more like companions traveling together." [[8083 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Luo Beiliya still wanted to try and correct the child's way of addressing her, but the other party's answer made her pause in surprise. [[8084 旁白 surprised]]
    "No, Miss Evelyn, you've misunderstood. I'm not showing you respect because of your status. It's not just because you saved my life, and my young lady's life too. There's another reason..." [[8085 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina, who was always mature and frank, found her cheeks unconsciously flushing as she spoke, clearly showing a maiden's shyness. [[8086 旁白 neutral]]
    Why are you suddenly blushing? I haven't done anything embarrassing to you! [[8087 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
    Luo Beiliya was puzzled, but the good upbringing of this body allowed her to maintain a calm and silent expression, waiting for the answer. [[8088 旁白 neutral]]
    "Miss Evelyn, this answer might be a little difficult to say, but... I don't want to deceive you. During the time I've followed you, I've constantly felt a motherly aura from you. It's this aura that makes me feel safe and respectful towards you from the bottom of my heart." [[8089 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Huh?! [[8090 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
    Surprisingly, after hearing this answer, Luo Beiliya's heart simply let out a habitual 'huh' sound as a吐槽 (tǔcáo - a light complaint/remark). Then, the hint of surprise faded, as if she had already guessed or grown used to it. [[8091 旁白 neutral]]
    "Have you ever felt something similar from Vlad?" [[8092 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "No, the two feelings are completely different! Although he was the one who turned me, from him, I only feel endless oppression and a desire for control, completely opposite to the peace I feel with you!" [[8093 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina shook her head forcefully, her expression utterly sincere. [[8094 旁白 neutral]]
    "If that's the case, then it probably has nothing to do with my vampire bloodline." [[8095 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Luo Beiliya rubbed her chin as she replied. [[8096 旁白 neutral]]
    She had a slight worry before, fearing that Seraphina's reverence towards her was entirely due to the vampire bloodline within her. After all, in terms of rank, she had absorbed an entire sixth-tier vampire duke, almost completely gaining her full bloodline. [[8097 旁白 neutral]]
    Cassandra was still one of the oldest vampires in the world. Although Vlad was also a sixth-tier vampire, by any measure, he could only be Cassandra's junior. There was bound to be a certain disparity in their bloodlines, not to mention Seraphina, who was turned by him. [[8098 旁白 neutral]]
    If it were a bloodline issue, she would always feel like she had "stolen" her colleague's female secretary, instantly feeling like a certain "healing magician" (referencing a character archetype). Fortunately, the problem wasn't from there. [[8099 旁白 neutral]]
    As Luo Beiliya breathed a sigh of relief, Seraphina's eyes also brightened. She was truly grateful for and respected this Water Saintess. But if this respect were mostly from a compulsory bloodline demand, the stubborn girl would feel as if her feelings were defiling this pure Saintess. [[8100 旁白 neutral]]
    But it turned out not to be the case, so she unconsciously pressed further. [[8101 旁白 neutral]]
    "Then why is it..." [[8102 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    The blue-haired girl sat elegantly on the blanket with her knees together, sipping the rich, fresh vegetable soup in small mouthfuls, her pupils clear and bright. [[8103 旁白 neutral]]
    "My constitution naturally makes people feel closer to me, which is why the town residents always like to come to me for confession. Of course, other Saintesses also have this ability; it's a passive power that unites people's hearts." [[8104 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Oh, is that how it is?" [[8105 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
    Seraphina held a steaming bowl of vegetable soup to warm her hands. Ever since she became a vampire, her body temperature was noticeably lower than an ordinary person's. Although vampires don't feel cold due to their body temperature, having been human, she still preferred the feeling of a warm body. [[8106 旁白 neutral]]
    Recalling the past, when she first met the young lady, she did naturally feel a sense of closeness to this noble girl who looked like an immortal. This was most likely the affinity Miss Evelyn spoke of. [[8107 旁白 neutral]]
    But if compared, the feeling was even stronger when she was near Miss Evelyn. [[8108 旁白 neutral]]
    As if understanding what the girl was thinking, Luo Beiliya smiled and explained. [[8109 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course, regarding this ability, I should be among the stronger ones among all the Saintesses, because water elements naturally come with an affinity attribute. So, among the six Saintesses, I should be the most special one." [[8110 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    The conversation unconsciously shifted to the domain of Saintesses. Seraphina, who had followed two Saintesses in total, immediately became interested. [[8111 旁白 neutral]]
    "Miss Evelyn, besides my young lady, do you know about the other Saintesses?" [[8112 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Unexpectedly, she received a negative answer. [[8113 旁白 neutral]]
    The girl opposite the bonfire watched the flickering firelight, smiled faintly, and then shook her head. [[8114 旁白 neutral]]
    "No, to be precise, if it weren't for this fated encounter with your young lady, my knowledge of the other four Saintesses would be almost zero." [[8115 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Eh?!" [[8116 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
    Seraphina was shocked. In her impression, although the Saintesses from various regions weren't closely connected due to territorial divisions, they definitely had a good understanding of each other. Just like when she followed Celeste (塞莱斯特) since childhood, Miss Celeste's childhood curriculum included a special course dedicated to learning about the other five Saintesses, excluding Windermere. [[8117 旁白 surprised]]
    Miss Evelyn didn't seem like someone who disliked studying, so how could it be... [[8118 旁白 neutral]]
    "Heh, that's because you don't know me yet. We haven't spent much time together, and what you've seen of me isn't my true self..." [[8119 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Luo Beiliya had no intention of deliberately hiding her past. Anyway, she had already embarked on this endless path of atonement, so revealing some of her past dark history was no big deal. [[8120 旁白 neutral]]
    "You've been following your young lady since childhood, so you must know about the Winterlein Family, right?" [[8121 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Yes, the six great Saintess families are the backbone of the Church in resisting the Demon Clan. I naturally know about that. However, compared to the other Saintesses, the Winterleins have been... in recent years..." [[8122 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina hesitated, stopping herself from speaking further. [[8123 旁白 neutral]]
    "You don't need to worry so much. I, this Saintess, am sitting right in front of you. Feel free to speak your mind boldly." [[8124 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    With Luo Beiliya's affirmation, Seraphina nodded and continued. [[8125 旁白 neutral]]
    "There are quite a few records about the Winterlein Family. After all, the Winterlein Family produces healing magic, and two of the four great healing forbidden spells originated from the Winterlein Family. Most high-ranking healing priests in the Church also come from Winterlein. Sickness, old age, and death are normal, and with the ability to heal injuries and illnesses, the Winterlein Family is quite popular among believers and even citizens. But in recent years..." [[8126 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Especially after the previous Water Saintess, Seraphina, returned to heaven, their family's reputation plummeted for a period. The specific reason seems to be caused by the only direct heir in their family." [[8127 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    After speaking, Seraphina glanced at Luo Beiliya's expression, but unexpectedly, she didn't detect much emotional fluctuation on her face. [[8128 旁白 surprised]]
    "You're right, these are all facts." [[8129 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "There was indeed an outrageous young master in the family. He relied on his status as the last direct heir to oppress the villagers, bullying both men and women. He was a notorious spoiled villain. The evil deeds he committed would probably be considered among the worst, even among the noble youths in the royal capital." [[8130 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Luo Beiliya narrated calmly, with no emotional fluctuations, as if talking about a stranger. [[8131 旁白 neutral]]
    "But that's clearly not true, because you are the proof!" [[8132 塞拉菲娜 excited]]
    Seraphina was so excited that she almost stood up, but fortunately, Luo Beiliya held her down in time. She, of course, knew why the girl was agitated and understood that it was a misunderstanding born of concern for her. She immediately chuckled. [[8133 旁白 neutral]]
    "No, that is the truth. The young man named Selen An was indeed the only direct heir in the entire family." [[8134 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "This, how can this be?" [[8135 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
    Seraphina's brows furrowed together. Although the Church always preached that God loved the world and that everyone was equal before the doctrine, this didn't apply at all to the Saintess families. Saintess families valued pure bloodlines the most, as they were true descendants of gods. Whoever had more and purer divine blood in their body also had more advantages in all aspects. [[8136 旁白 neutral]]
    Generally, the position of Saintess could only be born from direct descendants. As for collateral relatives becoming direct descendants, unless a chosen Saintess voluntarily grafted her bloodline to a collateral family member, it was almost impossible. After all, who would willingly give up their talents for no reason? [[8137 旁白 neutral]]
    Luo Beiliya didn't explain further. She simply placed the vegetable soup steadily on the blanket and stood up. [[8138 旁白 neutral]]
    In front of Seraphina, she put her hands together in a prayer pose, and divine light rippled. The figure that emerged once again from the divine light was a strange young man with short, sea-blue hair. [[8139 旁白 neutral]]
    Wait, what, what exactly is going on? [[8140 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
    Seraphina was completely bewildered by the situation. How did a perfectly fine Saintess suddenly turn into a man? [[8141 旁白 confused]]
    "No need to be surprised. This is my true form." [[8142 塞伦安 neutral]]
    The young man spoke. His voice wasn't the deep tone of an adult male, but rather the clear, bright sound of a youth. [[8143 旁白 neutral]]
    "As you can see, my true identity is that spoiled villain people talk about, Selen An Winterlein." [[8144 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Seraphina no longer knew what words or phrases to use to describe her current feelings. It was like a maiden who had fallen in love with a knight in shining armor, and after countless hardships, finally persuaded the white knight to remove his helmet, only for the head revealed beneath to be her usually drunken and lazy good-for-nothing brother. [[8145 旁白 surprised]]
    Even if I were guessing, I wouldn't have connected these two people, would I? [[8146 塞拉菲娜 surprised]]
    But reality was often more absurd than fantasy. The holy and flawless Saintess, whose true identity turned out to be a villainous young master who committed all sorts of evil deeds? [[8147 旁白 surprised]]
    Was the information false? Were the rumors unreliable? [[8148 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Selen An didn't pay much attention to what Celeste (塞莱斯特) was thinking. It had been a long time since he had used this body to move around. At this moment, he completely lacked the ingrained elegance of his Saintess form. He sat down ungracefully on the blanket, picked up the vegetable soup beside him, and began to eat voraciously. [[8149 旁白 neutral]]
    After eating, he didn't forget to wipe his mouth with his sleeve, then let out a comfortable sigh. [[8150 旁白 neutral]]
    His gaze fell upon the dumbfounded Seraphina, and the young man smiled helplessly. [[8151 旁白 neutral]]
    "Stop staring. I'll still look like this if you keep staring. To be honest, this body has changed a lot over the years." [[8152 塞伦安 neutral]]
    The young man lowered his head and clenched his fist, looking at his much thinner, pale arm. Undisguised heartache immediately appeared in his eyes. [[8153 旁白 sad]]
    Father Andrei's physique was actually based on his original body. Combined with the old man's almost perverse training methods, it took four years to develop such a muscular build, transforming him into the image of a muscle-bound priest. But the result was... [[8154 旁白 neutral]]
    This battle's consumption was too great. Almost eighty percent of his body's muscles were dissolved and consumed. Overnight, he instantly transformed from a muscular devil into a slender, delicate-looking man. [[8155 旁白 neutral]]
    Moreover, the physical changes seemed to be more than just losing muscle. According to what the old man said before, he had to mentally prepare himself. [[8156 旁白 neutral]]
