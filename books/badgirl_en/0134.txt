Chapter 134: "Me" [[8375 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, loving Mother Goddess of Life, please have mercy on your believer. I need your guidance, even a small hint, to show the right path to us lost lambs." [[8376 温蒂尼 neutral]]
    Unable to think of any solution, Wendini decided to pray to the gods, hoping to receive divine revelation. [[8377 旁白 neutral]]
    But closing her eyes to pray, apart from bringing her mind back to peace, the devout elven believer Wendini received no response. [[8378 旁白 neutral]]
    Wendini opened her eyes, a hint of regret flashing in her emerald eyes. [[8379 旁白 sad]]
    The Mother Goddess did not respond, but perhaps this was normal? [[8380 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, the loving Mother Goddess of Life had been sleeping for a long time. If it weren't for the fact that divine power could still be felt from the main statue in the deep-water cathedral, many believers would probably doubt whether this loving Mother Goddess had fallen over the long years... [[8381 旁白 neutral]]
    Without the guidance of life, how could one find the true Water Saintess? [[8382 旁白 neutral]]
    The golden-haired elven girl rested her hands on her cheeks, gazing at the still-clean single room, her gaze somewhat unfocused, perhaps daydreaming or deep in thought. [[8383 旁白 neutral]]
    After an unknown amount of time, Wendini's eyes suddenly lit up. [[8384 旁白 surprised]]
    "Oh? I got it!" [[8385 温蒂尼 happy]]
    Since the Mother Goddess of Life couldn't respond to believers due to her slumber, she would just pray to another god. [[8386 旁白 neutral]]
    Of course, as pure-blooded Golden Elves, their emotions and faith were incredibly sincere and devout. As a member of the Golden Elven royalty, Wendini would never divide her faith and devotion among multiple gods like polytheists. [[8387 旁白 neutral]]
    For an elf, this was a complete desecration of faith and the gods. [[8388 旁白 angry]]
    However, there was an exception— [[8389 旁白 neutral]]
    "Mother said that before our race received the blessings of the Mother Goddess of Life, the elven race had already left its footprints on this land, and at that time, we also had an original faith..." [[8390 温蒂尼 neutral]]
    Wendini murmured, reaching for her neck and slowly pulling out the necklace deeply hidden in her ample chest. [[8391 旁白 neutral]]
    The necklace pendant now lay in the girl's palm. Wendini gazed at the mini gem sword, which still held her warmth and scent, its flawless material reflected in her emerald eyes. [[8392 旁白 neutral]]
    "Let's try... what if?" [[8393 温蒂尼 neutral]]
    She convinced herself, though the chances of receiving a response from this god were even lower than from the Mother Goddess of Life. But now, she had no other better option, did she? [[8394 旁白 neutral]]
    Praying to the original faith god wasn't considered desecrating her faith. Even if she didn't get a response, it was just an attempt, a small act of respect to a god who had long since passed away. [[8395 旁白 neutral]]
    With this belief, Wendini held the mini gem sword pendant between her palms. She took a deep breath, dispelling the last trace of hesitation in her heart, bowed her head, and began to pray with an unprecedented, exploratory, and reverent piety. [[8396 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, Hestia, Goddess of the Lamp, slumbering soul guide, watchman of cycles, embodiment of ancient sparks..." [[8397 温蒂尼 neutral]]
    "I, Wendini Galanode, a humble descendant flowing with the blood of the original elves, hereby offer you long-sealed respect and a call." [[8398 温蒂尼 neutral]]
    Her voice initially carried a subtle tremble, like a traveler fumbling for a candlelight in the darkness, but it quickly settled, turning into a deep whisper that seemed to penetrate the dust of time, echoing in the quiet single room. [[8399 旁白 neutral]]
    "Please forgive my tribe's estrangement and silent years. It was not forgetfulness, but the tide of history that submerged the lamps of worship. Now, with deep respect for your ancient glory, I rekindle this call from the deepest part of my bloodline." [[8400 温蒂尼 sad]]
    "I seek the traces of the 'Water Saintess'—she is the embodiment of the flow of life, the key to maintaining balance. Yet, her figure is like moonlight hidden in the deep sea, nowhere to be found." [[8401 温蒂尼 sad]]
    "I know that under your authority over souls and cycles, the trajectories of all things sparkle like sparks in your eternal night. The soul imprints of the living, the remnants of the deceased's return, all are within your gaze." [[8402 温蒂尼 neutral]]
    "Goddess, I beg you!" [[8403 温蒂尼 fearful]]
    "If a wisp of your embers still remains, if you can still hear this faint call from a distant bloodline..." [[8404 温蒂尼 fearful]]
    "Please, with your lamp that discerns souls, illuminate the soul imprint of the Water Saintess for me!" [[8405 温蒂尼 fearful]]
    "Please, with your guiding glimmer of cycles, reveal the spark-like trajectory she left in this world!" [[8406 温蒂尼 fearful]]
    "By this gem sword, which carries an ancient oath, and by the primal call flowing in my bloodline, I testify. May my respect, like a faint spark, pierce through the long night of time and reach your throne." [[8407 温蒂尼 neutral]]
    "May the lamp never extinguish, may the soul guide always be present... May your glimmer guide my path." [[8408 温蒂尼 neutral]]
    Wendini's voice faded, her last words becoming a long sigh. [[8409 旁白 sad]]
    She herself knew that the chance of getting a response was minimal. Compared to the slumbering Mother Goddess of Life, this great Lantern Goddess, once regarded as the primal faith of the elven race, had long since... [[8410 旁白 sad]]
    But even so, she still refused to give up this last shred of hope. [[8411 旁白 neutral]]
    She maintained her bowed prayer posture, her palms still tightly clasping the gem sword pendant, as if wanting to pour all her mind and faint hope into it. [[8412 旁白 neutral]]
    Silence returned to the room, with only her faint breathing. She tightly closed her eyes, holding her breath, concentrating fully on every subtle change in the pendant in her palm, feeling if there was any unusual ripple in the surrounding air. [[8413 旁白 neutral]]
    Even the faintest, symbolic response, a sudden warmth appearing out of nowhere, a touch on a soul level, or a faint glow from the pendant itself... [[8414 旁白 neutral]]
    She waited, like waiting in the boundless darkness for the legendary first lamplight that could guide souls. Time seemed to stretch, every second filled with unknown hope and heavy anxiety. [[8415 旁白 neutral]]
    And so she waited, and waited. The girl's breathing gradually steadied, her consciousness completely relaxed, and in the process of waiting for a response during her prayer, she unknowingly fell asleep... [[8416 旁白 neutral]]
    ............ [[8417 旁白 neutral]]
    ............ [[8418 旁白 neutral]]
    "Sorry, Seraphina, I think I just lost my composure a bit." [[8419 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Inside the tent, the girl, who had woken up from her stupor, half-rubbed her forehead and said with a hint of apology. [[8420 旁白 neutral]]
    "None of that matters. How does Miss feel now?" [[8421 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina, who was guarding outside the tent, asked with concern. [[8422 旁白 neutral]]
    "It's fine, maybe it's because I've used too much power lately, and my body isn't quite used to it. After a short nap, I feel much better." [[8423 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Lobelia shook her head. [[8424 旁白 neutral]]
    "Then, when Miss was unconscious, did you dream or see any images?" [[8425 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Dream? Images? Could it be you also..." [[8426 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
    Lobelia widened her eyes in surprise, and Seraphina nodded with a serious expression. [[8427 旁白 neutral]]
    "If the name Hestia was mentioned in the images, then we most likely saw the same image." [[8428 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Immediately after, the two briefly compared the images they had seen, and the conclusion was consistent. [[8429 旁白 neutral]]
    The only difference was that Seraphina saw the image from a third-person perspective, while Lobelia was immersed in the dream-like reality from a first-person perspective. [[8430 旁白 neutral]]
    "In the dream, I couldn't help but call out the name Hestia, and at the same time, I saw her departing back. My heart..." [[8431 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    As she spoke, the girl's hand involuntarily touched her chest, and her blue eyes held lingering sadness. [[8432 旁白 sad]]
    It was clear that the dream had a significant impact on her. Even after waking up, the emotions generated in the dream were still carried into reality. [[8433 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hestia... a very unfamiliar name. It feels like the true name of a certain deity. In my memory, among all the books I've read, this name is rarely mentioned." [[8434 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina stroked her chin, frowning deeply. [[8435 旁白 neutral]]
    As a holy nun, she had followed Celeste for many years, and with this advantage, she could freely access various libraries. As a former orphan, Seraphina always had a strong desire for books and knowledge, which were difficult to obtain. [[8436 旁白 neutral]]
    And yet, even after reading so many books, she had never heard the name Hestia. This made her wonder if "Hestia" held some unknown meaning. [[8437 旁白 neutral]]
    Otherwise, books should not avoid the existence of a deity. [[8438 旁白 neutral]]
    "I, however, feel a strange sense of familiarity with this name." [[8439 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    Lobelia suddenly spoke, looking at the bonfire still burning outside the tent. [[8440 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is Miss saying you recall this name?" [[8441 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "Yes, in short, this is definitely not the first time I've heard this name. Just by murmuring it, I can feel a subtle familiarity and closeness." [[8442 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "But as for more about this name... I don't have any memory of it for now." [[8443 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
    "Has Miss ever experienced amnesia?" [[8444 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina, also looking at the bonfire, was silent, then suddenly asked something seemingly unrelated to the topic. [[8445 旁白 neutral]]
    "Amnesia? No, I never..." [[8446 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
    Lobelia instinctively wanted to deny it but paused. [[8447 旁白 neutral]]
    Because she suddenly remembered that if her first life was counted, she was successfully corrupted by Mara, her soul was twisted, and her later memories were indeed missing to her. Strictly speaking, she did have an experience of amnesia. [[8448 旁白 neutral]]
    Seraphina seemed to have noticed something from the hesitation on the girl's face and continued. [[8449 旁白 neutral]]
    "If Miss has ever experienced amnesia, then in the past, you were very likely closely connected to the name Hestia, even if you don't remember it now..." [[8450 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    "I don't know." [[8451 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    Lobelia suddenly wrapped the blanket tighter around herself, her beautiful blue eyes dimming. [[8452 旁白 sad]]
    "Miss..." [[8453 塞拉菲娜 sad]]
    "Seraphina, actually, I'm far less strong than I appear on the surface. As I confessed to you before, my original body was truly male. I only got this current body after awakening my bloodline. But with the use of my power, my body is undergoing some irreversible changes..." [[8454 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    "But none of this is the most important!" [[8455 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
    "Compared to the sins I've committed, simply turning into a girl isn't something to be afraid of at all. What I truly worry about, or rather, fear, is precisely myself..." [[8456 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
    By the warm bonfire, both their profiles were illuminated. They looked at each other, silent. [[8457 旁白 neutral]]
    Seraphina did not speak, but simply reached out and silently held the other's hand, trying to convey her body temperature and heartbeat, or to prove her own existence. [[8458 旁白 neutral]]
    "Every time the divine blood in my body boils, I feel less and less like myself. Extreme rationality, an ethereal and indifferent voice, absolute control over life—these... are not the attributes of a person, but of a god." [[8459 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
    Seraphina held the girl's hand tighter, her throat feeling tight and her mouth dry. [[8460 旁白 sad]]
    "Miss..." [[8461 塞拉菲娜 sad]]
    "If the physical body is a shell and container for moving through the world, the soul is our true self. Changes to the body can still be accepted and tolerated, but if the soul is modified, even just a little, subtly, painlessly, or even naturally..." [[8462 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
    "Then am I still me?" [[8463 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
    "In the unknowable future, will it be a divine descendant atoning for sins walking the earth, or merely a divine puppet saving the distressed?" [[8464 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
    The intelligent girl knew the laws of all waters, yet she could not clarify the most fundamental confusion within her heart. [[8465 旁白 neutral]]
    "Perhaps this is my fate. After harming countless innocent people, my atonement is endless. Mortals, whether in soul or body, will eventually decay and dissipate. Only by becoming such an omnipotent, loving embodiment can I truly cleanse my sins, so it is only right that I become like that..." [[8466 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
    The girl's eyes became increasingly hollow with her words. Just as the high-light vanished from her blue eyes, both her hands were tightly clasped, and the soft touch and pull seemed to call her soul back. [[8467 旁白 neutral]]
    "No, there is never such a thing as 'only right'. Choice is choice. It is a unique decision made by your personal will, and absolutely not a predetermined direction carried by so-called fate!" [[8468 塞拉菲娜 angry]]
    Seraphina's voice was decisive, sounding especially clear and powerful amidst the crackling of the bonfire. The warmth of her hands permeated her skin, burning almost into Lobelia's cold heart. [[8469 旁白 neutral]]
    The hollowness in those blue eyes was stirred by this sudden warmth and force, and a faint light struggled to reappear. [[8470 旁白 neutral]]
    "Miss..." [[8471 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina's voice deepened, carrying an undeniable seriousness. [[8472 旁白 neutral]]
    "Look at me, you are not a puppet, not a marionette. The confusion, fear, and even resistance to this change you feel, these struggles themselves are undeniable proof of 'your' existence! It's your soul crying out, it's 'Lobelia' confirming her boundaries! Gods don't fear becoming gods, but you do. Because you are human, with a human heart, a human past, human... sins and punishments, and human choice." [[8473 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    She leaned slightly forward, the bonfire's light dancing in her eyes, like steadfast stars. [[8474 旁白 neutral]]
    "Change is an inevitable result of power, but where it leads? Will you become the 'divine puppet' you fear, or will you uphold 'Lobelia's' will within that power? This choice is made every time you use your power, every time you face a decision. It's not decided at some future endpoint, but now, at this moment, right here, by you." [[8475 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
