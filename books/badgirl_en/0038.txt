Chapter 38: Awakening [[2160 旁白 neutral]]
"It's time to wake from your dream, my little crybaby~" [[2161 陌生女1 neutral]]
"The girl's gentle voice was like a mother's warm and pleasant wake-up call, a soft touch by the bed in the morning." [[2162 旁白 neutral]]
"Serenia's eyelashes trembled violently. After some struggle, the sleeping ice beauty finally opened her hazy eyes, a look of confusion on her face as she had just awoken." [[2163 旁白 neutral]]
"It was a very unfamiliar voice, yet its warmth carried a deep sense of familiarity. The nickname used at the end awakened an important memory buried deep inside her, the one that gave her a reason to live." [[2164 旁白 neutral]]
"Now, after so many years, hearing that distant yet intimate name again would have woken even a sleeping beauty from a sweet dream, especially since her own dream was not a pleasant one." [[2165 旁白 neutral]]
"The holy song that pierced through reality into her dream was like a pure white salvation, a lifeline that pulled her back from the edge of hell to the world of the living." [[2166 旁白 surprised]]
"But when she opened her eyes, the sight of the figure slowly coming into focus made her already confused mind completely shut down." [[2167 旁白 surprised]]
"Lady Seravia?!" [[2168 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Am I still in a dream?" [[2169 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Otherwise, why would the first person I see after waking up be the Water Saintess, Seravia Winterlein, who died long ago?!" [[2170 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"The name alone might sound unfamiliar, but to Serenia, this Water Saintess who had long since passed away held a more important identity: she was Selen An's mother." [[2171 旁白 neutral]]
"So, was the holy song I just heard sung by Lady Seravia? Does this mean I haven't actually woken up, but have died and my soul has gone to heaven, allowing me to see the late Lady Seravia?" [[2172 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"When she got a clear look at the woman's sky-blue, teardrop-shaped eyes, she became almost certain of her guess. At the same time, a strong feeling of guilt filled her heart, and she lowered her head, unable to look at her." [[2173 旁白 sad]]
"I failed to protect Selen An. Even in heaven, how can I face his mother?" [[2174 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"But the Seravia in heaven seemed much younger than she remembered. She didn't look like the wise Saintess who had ruled for many years, but more like a young girl who had just been named a Saintess." [[2175 旁白 neutral]]
"But a soul isn't like a body; it isn't affected by time. In the heaven created by the gods, the souls of Saintesses should be able to appear at any age they wish, right?" [[2176 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"She guessed wildly, as if trying to find a good and logical reason for what was happening." [[2177 旁白 neutral]]
"So, what silly things are you thinking about now, little crybaby~?" [[2178 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"The girl's red lips parted slightly. Her gentle voice, with its unique healing quality, was so pleasant it was a joy to hear." [[2179 旁白 neutral]]
"Lady Seravia is so..." [[2180 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"Wait! What did she call me?" [[2181 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Perhaps because she had been awake long enough, or because her chaotic thoughts had finally cleared, Serenia, lying in the girl's arms, suddenly widened her eyes and looked at the girl in disbelief." [[2182 旁白 surprised]]
"You are!" [[2183 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Suddenly, a bold guess appeared in her mind. But the guess was so shocking that she found it hard to believe for a moment, though the question had already left her lips." [[2184 旁白 surprised]]
"Are you asking about me, Sister Serenia?" [[2185 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"The blue-haired girl tilted her head, her smile as gentle as the first light of dawn." [[2186 旁白 neutral]]
"My name is Lobelia Winterlein. If you wanted to know my name, Sister Serenia, you can just call me Lobelia." [[2187 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"Her voice was very light, like a dandelion seed floating on the air, so soft and gentle that it made you want to close your eyes in comfort." [[2188 旁白 neutral]]
"Where is Selen An? How is he?!" [[2189 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
"As if the surname Winterlein had reminded her of something, Serenia forgot her dignity as a Saintess and grabbed the corner of Lobelia's dress, asking anxiously." [[2190 旁白 fearful]]
"You don't need to worry. He is fine. And I am here to help you." [[2191 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
"As she spoke, Lobelia's hand, which was around Serenia, gently patted her back. A hopeful, milky-white light bloomed in her palm, and a holy power seeped into Serenia's body in an extremely gentle way, quietly restoring her physical condition." [[2192 旁白 neutral]]
"She let go of Serenia and helped her stand steady. The beautiful, paradise-like scenery in front of her made the girl's pupils shrink. She pinched her thigh hard, deeply suspecting that everything before her was just an illusion. But when she turned around, she once again met Lobelia's gentle and loving smile." [[2193 旁白 surprised]]
"Under the shade of the ancient Tree of Life, the blue-haired Saintess stood with her hands crossed over her stomach. The spring breeze blew gently, her long hair swaying. Her beautiful blue eyes were like a calm lake, reflecting Serenia's figure." [[2194 旁白 neutral]]
"It was all too beautiful, so beautiful it felt like a dream. It was so vivid, yet the shock of it all made it feel unreal." [[2195 旁白 surprised]]
"I..." [[2196 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"Ice Saintess, do you have the guts to fight me to the death?!" [[2197 克格萨 angry]]
"The beautiful moment was broken by the sudden, hoarse voice. Serenia turned to look at the source of the sound. Only about ten meters away, Demon General Koxha was holding a giant bone axe, staring at her with a fierce look, as if he could attack at any moment." [[2198 旁白 fearful]]
"But... what was strange was that he was yelling very loudly, but the killing intent from his body seemed to be limited by some rule, and was unusually low." [[2199 旁白 surprised]]
"The surrounding demon soldiers were even stranger. All kinds of weapons were scattered on the grass. Despite their commander's declaration of war, not a single soldier picked up a weapon to charge." [[2200 旁白 surprised]]
"Something is not right. Nothing here makes any sense!" [[2201 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
"Serenia placed a hand on her chest and shook her head without thinking." [[2202 旁白 neutral]]
"When Koxha saw this, he was so angry he could have stomped his feet." [[2203 旁白 angry]]
"Damn it, the Water Saintess over there had completely disabled his attack button, insisting on a non-violent approach. He had been waiting for the Ice Saintess to thaw and wake up, so she could accept his challenge and break the 'no-fight' buff on him." [[2204 旁白 angry]]
"But she just shook her head and refused. This isn't how things were supposed to go!" [[2205 旁白 angry]]
"As a descendant of the God of Judgment, shouldn't she gladly accept his challenge for a fair duel?" [[2206 旁白 angry]]
"What does 'refuse' even mean?!" [[2207 克格萨 angry]]
"Of course, Koxha didn't understand that Serenia's head shake was not a response to his challenge at all. She was simply stunned by the situation and it was an unconscious reaction." [[2208 旁白 neutral]]
"You cowardly descendant of Glacies, is this how you answer to the divine blood in your veins?! Avoiding a fight with the Demon Clan, your actions are unworthy of the Ice God's name of Judgment!" [[2209 克格萨 angry]]
"Face me in battle! That is the choice you should make!" [[2210 克格萨 angry]]
"Koxha let out a deafening roar, but that was all he could do. He couldn't imagine what he could do to the two Saintesses less than twenty meters away if Serenia refused to fight him again." [[2211 旁白 neutral]]
"His attack, skill, and ultimate buttons were all disabled. Looking himself over, the only thing he could control was his non-aggressive movement. As long as the other side didn't attack first, he couldn't break the 'no-fight' restriction." [[2212 旁白 sad]]
"Isn't this Water Saintess a cheater?" [[2213 克格萨 angry]]
"How is this game playable without a nerf?" [[2214 克格萨 angry]]
