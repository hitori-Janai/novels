Chapter 47: The Old Man [[2693 旁白 neutral]]
    Unlike the bustling atmosphere outside the church, the backyard of the church was exceptionally quiet at this moment. [[2694 旁白 neutral]]
    In medieval Western countries, influenced by Christianity, most cemeteries where people were buried after death were located around churches. In this respect, the customs on the Nefarem Continent were almost identical. [[2695 旁白 neutral]]
    The church's backyard was a cemetery, a peaceful resting place for the deceased. Naturally, no noisy sounds could be heard there, only the faint chirping of birds and insects. [[2696 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre came here to pay respects to an old friend. Originally, he had planned to prepare some chicken, duck, and fish to place before the tombstone, following the customs of his previous life, to show his remembrance and filial piety. However, thinking of the old man's strict and meticulous personality when he was alive, he gave up on this traditional way of grave sweeping from his hometown. [[2697 旁白 neutral]]
    Besides, if he were to put so much food in front of the tombstone, it would probably become a mess, snatched by stray cats and dogs attracted by the smell at night. Who knows how foul-mouthed the old man's soul would be underground then. [[2698 旁白 neutral]]
    After balanced consideration, everything was simplified. Andre was still dressed in his white priestly robes, holding a bouquet of white lilies he had prepared beforehand. [[2699 旁白 neutral]]
    Following familiar memories, he walked to a corner of the cemetery and skillfully found the inconspicuous tombstone. [[2700 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre squatted down, placed the bouquet on the small stone platform in front of the tombstone, and then carefully examined the dark tombstone. The back of the tombstone was bare, just like other ordinary people's tombstones. No… [[2701 旁白 neutral]]
    Compared to ordinary people's tombstones, the old man's tombstone should have been even more shabby. [[2702 旁白 sad]]
    At least on ordinary people's tombstones, the name of the deceased, date of birth and death, and some epitaphs, long or short, were engraved. But on his tombstone, apart from a monotonous name, there was nothing else. [[2703 旁白 neutral]]
    If a stranger came here and pointed at this tombstone, telling them that this person was a priest when he was alive, no one would probably believe it, but that was the truth. [[2704 旁白 neutral]]
    Two years had passed since they met until the old man's death. Recalling that past, even in dreams, Andre couldn't help but marvel. [[2705 旁白 surprised]]
    If fate was composed of coincidences, then the coincidences between him and this old priest were so numerous that it seemed like destiny. [[2706 旁白 neutral]]
    He reached out and gently stroked the rough words "Angor" on the tombstone. His blue eyes, like a calm tide, gradually deepened. [[2707 旁白 neutral]]
    Four years ago, he returned to this world as Selen An. When he first arrived, he thought he had transmigrated into an R-rated game world. However, through a series of subsequent survival attempts, various coincidences and accidents made him understand that he was actually a reborn person. [[2708 旁白 neutral]]
    His all-out counterattack led him to kill Mara, the succubus destined to drag him into the abyss of demonic degeneration. Near the brink of death, Anna's emergency rescue and Serenia's desperate call helped him find his way back to the world of the living. [[2709 旁白 neutral]]
    In the bloodline space, he conversed with the first saintess, resolved his inner turmoil, unlocked the sealed bloodline, and, as Loperia, confronted Kogsa, the descendant of the Archduke of Hell. [[2710 旁白 neutral]]
    After "fairly" pacifying the enraged demon general with his bloodline power, he originally thought he could clear the stage without injury. Unexpectedly, the opponent, desperate, chose to self-destruct his soul to drag her down with him, forcing her to use the mysterious divine art in the panel, the only one without a skill description. [[2711 旁白 fearful]]
    As for the final outcome... it was obvious that he was still standing here, which meant Kogsa's plot had failed. All living beings protected by the divine art domain would not embrace death, but as the Water Saintess, he had truly borne most of the soul storm's damage. [[2712 旁白 neutral]]
    The energy fluctuations caused by the storm were too intense, causing a brief spatial紊乱. Having taken full damage, he was already disoriented and dizzy, and was dragged by the chaotic space to an unfamiliar coordinate without any resistance. [[2713 旁白 neutral]]
    This coordinate happened to be the old man's courtyard. According to the old man's recollection, he had simply fallen from the sky, smashing heavily onto him and landing safely as if on a cushion. For this, during their two years of cohabitation, he had received no small number of exasperated looks from the old man. [[2714 旁白 neutral]]
    However, despite his bad temper, the old man was a genuinely good person. Upon finding a mysterious girl who had fallen from the sky, he not only didn't publicize the matter but also took him in, giving him a legal identity as a priest. [[2715 旁白 neutral]]
    At first, he was very wary of this eccentric old man. After all, at that time, he was still in his Saintess form, and a man and a woman alone in a room didn't sound like a good scenario. [[2716 旁白 fearful]]
    Fortunately, though ill-tempered, the old man was a respectable person. At the time, he was severely injured and almost unable to move on his own. The old man not only took him in but also meticulously cared for him for about a month, during which he boiled medicine and fed him, treating him like his own daughter. [[2717 旁白 neutral]]
    Of course, it was precisely because of this period of interaction that he completely trusted the old man. Later, he settled down in Kempfa Town as Father Angor's adopted son and student. During this time, the old man truly treated him as his own son, not only helping him find a way to transform back into a male body but also imparting all his lifelong knowledge without reservation. [[2718 旁白 happy]]
    Two years later, the old man passed away peacefully. With the identity of the old man's adopted son and student, coupled with the reputation and prestige he had accumulated over the years, he naturally succeeded him as the priest of this small town's church. [[2719 旁白 neutral]]
    The initial encounter was bizarre, the process was bizarre, and the outcome was bizarre. Such an illogical story, from beginning to end, was precisely his entire experience over the past four years. [[2720 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, old man, old man, now that you're gone, I really am a bit unaccustomed to it." [[2721 安德烈 sad]]
    Andre stroked the rough surface of the tombstone, muttering to himself. [[2722 安德烈 sad]]
    He wasn't unaware of the old man's kindness to him; otherwise, he wouldn't have stayed and lived in this small town for four years, even becoming its priest, showing a tendency to spend his entire life in this remote town. [[2723 旁白 neutral]]
    However, he still couldn't understand why the old man took him in. [[2724 旁白 neutral]]
    If it was out of the kindness of a clergyman, and also concerns about his potentially unsimple identity, then after taking him in for a month until his injuries healed, he could have simply let him go quietly. [[2725 旁白 neutral]]
    But that wasn't the case. He clearly saw himself in his Saintess form, the Water Saintess robe he wore at the time, his long aquamarine hair, and his highly recognizable teardrop-shaped eyes. As an old clergyman, Angor couldn't have been ignorant of these divine elements. Given his astonished expression when he saw him, it was highly probable that he understood something. [[2726 旁白 neutral]]
    Knowing his identity, taking in the Water Saintess who was being widely sought by the Church, helping him conceal his identity, and unreservedly teaching him various knowledge, even life experiences—this was completely raising him as his own son (or daughter). [[2727 旁白 neutral]]
    Yet, before their unexpected meeting, they were complete strangers. Selen An had searched through all his memories and found no one named Angor. [[2728 旁白 neutral]]
    Long periods of contact made him trust this eccentric old man, but this inexplicable help, which could even be called love, always left a knot in his heart, as he didn't know the true reason behind it. [[2729 旁白 sad]]
    If he directly asked the old man, the old man would only roll his eyes and snort, fobbing him off with excuses like "I'm old and looking for a suitable successor, and you just happened to fall from the sky, seemingly guided by a deity." [[2730 旁白 neutral]]
    And then he would scold him severely, calling him dull and unable to complete the theological homework and training he assigned on time. [[2731 旁白 neutral]]
    As for indirect inquiries, that was even more impossible. The old man was old but not muddle-headed, and his mouth was sealed as if with glue; nothing could be pried out of him. [[2732 旁白 neutral]]
    And so, two years later, he was buried with this secret. Even now, as he came to pay his respects, squatting before this tombstone, he could no longer get the real answer from his lips. [[2733 旁白 sad]]
    But it didn't matter anymore. Let the unanswered questions be buried forever. He would always remember the old man's kindness to him, treating it like that of his own father. [[2734 旁白 neutral]]
    "Old man, rest peacefully in Heaven. I'll guard this town for you..." [[2735 安德烈 neutral]]
    The white lilies on the stone platform contrasted with the black tombstone, exceptionally silent. The white-robed priest stood up, gazing at the name on the tombstone, making this promise. [[2736 旁白 neutral]]
