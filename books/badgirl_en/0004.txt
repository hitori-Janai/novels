Chapter 4, Reset 4: The Showdown Already? [[184 旁白 neutral]]
After traveling day and night, when Selen An was pulled from the carriage, he had already arrived at Craigmore. [[185 旁白 neutral]]
Craigmore was a vast wasteland with scarce resources, barren land, and few people. It was always seen as the buffer zone between the allied nations and the demon territory. [[186 旁白 neutral]]
Being here meant they were not far from the rotting lands of the demons, known as hell on earth. Since it was a buffer zone, you might see bloodthirsty demon soldiers or powerful Church knights, but you were most likely to run into demons. [[187 旁白 fearful]]
Because not many sane people wandered around this buffer zone for fun. Even if they did, they would have long become a pile of white bones somewhere in the vast wilderness. [[188 旁白 fearful]]
Run, run, run... [[189 塞伦安 fearful]]
Even though he knew running now was unwise and impossible, the instinct for survival still drove him to call out that simple, short command in his mind. [[190 旁白 fearful]]
Even as he desperately tried to stay calm, cold sweat poured down his back like cold water, soaking his clothes and dampening his palms. [[191 旁白 fearful]]
His heavy breathing might have been covered by the sound of his running feet, but fear was never an emotion that could be hidden. Ahead, Mara, who was pulling Selen An along, suddenly stopped. [[192 旁白 surprised]]
She looked old and frail, her facial skin loose and yellowed like old tree bark, yet she moved as fast as a sprinting adult, leaving the young man forced to follow her breathless and panting. [[193 旁白 neutral]]
This body was too weak, drained by a life of pleasure, but he had already surpassed ordinary limits by lasting this long. The endurance stat on his panel was not just for show. [[194 旁白 neutral]]
The sudden stop made him cautious. His right arm was still held tightly by the old woman, her thin fingers clamped around his forearm like iron pliers, impossible to break free. [[195 旁白 fearful]]
"Mara, why did we suddenly stop? We..." [[196 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An, feeling uneasy, only got halfway through his sentence before forcing the rest of the words back down his throat. He trembled uncontrollably, his pupils reflecting a strange smile like the cat-faced old woman from a childhood horror movie. [[197 旁白 fearful]]
All the wrinkles on Mara's face seemed to bunch up together, but it wasn't a frown, it was a smile. Age had corroded her skin, but it hadn't clouded her eyes. Those eyes, squeezed between what looked like old tree bark, held a strange, mocking expression. [[198 旁白 fearful]]
"Master Selen An, what are you afraid of?" [[199 玛拉 neutral]]
Her voice was very soft, yet carried a peculiar sharpness, like a needle piercing the young man's heart, causing it to flutter for a moment. [[200 旁白 fearful]]
"I..." [[201 塞伦安 fearful]]
His voice couldn't help but tremble. [[202 旁白 fearful]]
He could feel a chilling cold flowing through his entire body from his captured forearm, as if it were about to freeze all the blood in his veins. [[203 旁白 fearful]]
He wanted to break free, but he couldn't. [[204 旁白 fearful]]
A sense of powerlessness enveloped him. The words he wanted to say, the things he wanted to do, even his thoughts were smashed to pieces by the great hammer of fear, churned into a messy pulp. [[205 旁白 fearful]]
"Master, you actually already know something, don't you?" [[206 玛拉 neutral]]
She was still smiling, and her smile grew more and more delighted. [[207 旁白 fearful]]
"Ever since the carriage inspection midway, I noticed something was off. Normally, when you suffered such pain, Master, you would have been rolling on the carriage floor, groaning with tears and snot..." [[208 玛拉 neutral]]
"But not that time. As I got closer, I could see the fine sweat on your forehead, but I felt it was more from fear than from pain~" [[209 玛拉 neutral]]
"The feeling of fear has been lingering around you from the very beginning, and every time I approached, the scent of your fear grew stronger, even though you were trying to hide it~" [[210 玛拉 neutral]]
For some reason, hearing this alluring and captivating voice come from that old woman's wrinkled mouth didn't feel strange to Selen An at all. [[211 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps it was because he already knew her identity, or perhaps it was due to the demonic nature that was rooted deep in her bones. [[212 旁白 neutral]]
"But what I'm most curious about is, Master, when did you become so clever? Clever enough to see through all my little secrets without a sound~" [[213 玛拉 surprised]]
Her voice grew more sickly and crazed, yet at that moment, she unexpectedly released her iron-like grip. [[214 旁白 surprised]]
Her dry, bark-like skin swelled up as if filled with water. The age spots faded from Mara's face and hands, revealing tender, deep purple skin. Her stooped body straightened, and the traces of old age vanished, replaced by an unnatural 'youth'. [[215 旁白 surprised]]
A pair of goat-like horns grew from the top of her head, her skin all over turned deep purple, and a tail with a heart-shaped tip emerged from under her leather skirt. [[216 旁白 surprised]]
In the blink of an eye, the nun Mara had completely transformed on the spot. Goat horns, a heart-shaped tail—these were the classic symbols of a succubus. [[217 旁白 surprised]]
And those orbs... they were bigger than his head! [[218 旁白 surprised]]
"As expected of an 18+ game, even an old woman can be made this lewd." [[219 塞伦安 neutral]]
This complaint popped into Selen An's mind for no reason. He was about to try and escape during the opponent's transformation animation, but with just a single motion of turning around, a high wall of fire erupted in a five-meter radius around them. [[220 旁白 fearful]]
The flames cut off his retreat, forcing this complete weakling to face the succubus who had just stripped down at the drop of a hat. [[221 旁白 fearful]]
Under the sun, the succubus Mara was completely naked. Her original nun's habit had turned to ash after her transformation. But even stark naked, there wasn't a hint of shame on her inhuman face. [[222 旁白 neutral]]
Demons generally lack human morals. This was one of the more logical settings in this 18+ game world. [[223 旁白 neutral]]
"What, you've been exposed? Are you going to kill me to silence me?" [[224 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An faced the pressure of the succubus. He tried his best to maintain a calm exterior, but his legs wouldn't stop shaking. [[225 旁白 fearful]]
It felt like how a hominid ancestor on the savanna would feel when targeted by a saber-toothed tiger—a fear at the genetic level, impossible to resist. [[226 旁白 fearful]]
"No, no, no, Master. Since you could figure out my identity, you should understand why I captured you..." [[227 玛拉 neutral]]
"You are my dear little treasure right now. How could I bear to harm you, Master? After all, in just a few hours, we might be calling each other 'sisters'~" [[228 玛拉 happy]]
Selen An felt a chill as she stared at him, and the final word, 'sisters,' made his heart pound violently. [[229 旁白 fearful]]
Mara was approaching step by step. The closer they got, the more Selen An could feel the thick aura of 'desire' radiating from her. [[230 旁白 fearful]]
Succubi are a race that feeds on desire. In their eyes, all males are food. [[231 旁白 fearful]]
"Stay back!" [[232 塞伦安 fearful]]
The young man suddenly shouted. A shard of glass had appeared in his hand at some point, its sharp, irregular edge pressed against his neck. [[233 旁白 fearful]]
This was one of the countermeasures he had thought of in the carriage: smashing the glass bottle to use as a weapon for suicide. [[234 旁白 fearful]]
If before he was still stuck in his modern-day habits, fantasizing about a no-damage escape, the current situation had forced him to bring out his ruthless side. [[235 旁白 fearful]]
Mara's ultimate goal was to hold him tightly in her grasp until the demon army arrived to carry out a series of humiliating and vicious plans. [[236 旁白 fearful]]
But all of this was based on the premise that he, a direct descendant of the Water Saintess, could be brought to them alive. Before, the only one who could threaten his life was the Ice Saintess hunting him from behind. Now, there was one more: himself. [[237 旁白 fearful]]
Even though Selen An knew this small glass shard couldn't completely stop a succubus, at a critical moment, every second counted. To turn the tables, he had to wait for that key person who was on her way. [[238 旁白 fearful]]
