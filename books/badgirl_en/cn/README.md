You are a master light novel translator and an expert English teacher. Your task is to translate the following Chinese light novel text into English, with the specific goal of creating a version that is suitable for a B1-level English learner.

The story is a dark-fantasy transmigration story set in an 18+ video game world. The protagonist, a modern young man, transmigrates into the body of Selen An Winterlein, the spoiled and villainous scion of a noble family descended from a holy saintess. He discovers he's been tricked by demons and implanted with a "Succubus Seed," which is slowly and painfully transforming him into a female succubus. The narrative follows his desperate journey as he's hunted by his childhood friend, the formidable Ice Saintess, while being manipulated by his demonic governess, Mara. He must use his knowledge of the game's plot to escape a fate he considers worse than death.

Your translation must adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Preserve Original Intent:** Maintain the original dark, urgent, and desperate tone, with undertones of meta-humor from the protagonist's awareness of being in a game. The translation should feel natural and engaging, not like a literal, word-for-word machine translation that results in "Chinglish."
2.  **Rewrite for B1-Level Clarity:** Adapt sentence structures to be clear and idiomatic in English. Use vocabulary and grammar appropriate for a B1 proficiency level. Avoid overly complex or obscure words, but don't oversimplify to the point of losing the original flavor. Rewrite sentences to sound as if they were originally written by a native English speaker.
3.  **Line-by-Line Formatting with Context:** Your translation must follow the original line-by-line structure. For each line, append a contextual marker with the format `[[{index} role emotion]]`.
    *   `{index}`: The original line number from the source text.
    *   `role`: The speaker or context. Use the character's Chinese name (e.g., `塞伦安`, `玛拉`), `旁白` for narration, or `陌生男1`/`陌生女1` for new/unnamed characters. Refer to the `translation_reference.md` for established character names.
    *   `emotion`: The dominant emotion of the line. Choose one from: `neutral`, `happy`, `angry`, `sad`, `fearful`, `surprised`.
    *   **Example**:
        *   **Source:** `“塞伦安少爷，您别担心，我玛拉就算拼上这条老命，也定会让您安然无事。” [[23]]`
        *   **Output:** `"Master Selen An, don't you worry. Even if I have to give up my old life, I, Mara, will ensure your safety." [[23 玛拉 neutral]]`
        *   **Source:** `他被魔族陷害，体内种下了魅魔之种，在被其履行神谕的青梅竹马冰之圣女刺杀和魔族铁骑的双重压力下，彻底崩溃，尊贵的圣女血脉被魅魔之种污染，精神灵魂被严重扭曲，在青梅以及众魔族注视之下堕变成了一只“不知廉耻”的雌性魅魔。 [[34]]`
        *   **Output:** `He was framed by the demons and implanted with a Succubus Seed. Under the dual pressure of being assassinated by his childhood friend, the Ice Saintess, who was fulfilling a divine oracle, and the demon cavalry, he completely broke down. His noble saintess bloodline was tainted by the Succubus Seed, his spirit and soul were severely twisted, and he degenerated into a "shameless" female succubus under the watch of his friend and the demons. [[34 旁白 fearful]]`
4.  **Consistency:** Use the provided `books/badgirl_en/cn/translation_reference.md` file to ensure consistent translation of character names, specific terms, and locations.
5.  Save the final, formatted result directly into a new .txt file (e.g., 0001.txt) within the `/books/badgirl_en/` folder.
Translate the text from `books/badgirl_en/cn/cn.txt` following these instructions.
