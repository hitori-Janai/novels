Chapter 81: Sensing [[4592 旁白 neutral]]
    Since joining the Church and becoming a glorious holy clergy member, Anna had never seen Princess Serenia lose her composure like this. [[4593 旁白 neutral]]
    Clearly, just moments ago, the Princess was still in a meeting with the high-ranking officials of the Church, discussing security matters concerning the Craigmore border. Yet now, she was rushing back, completely disregarding her image. [[4594 旁白 neutral]]
    In recent years, the previously restless Demon Clan had suddenly quieted down, partly due to the elves stationed on the Craigmore Plains attracting their hostility. [[4595 旁白 neutral]]
    As one of the key figures in the transformation of the Craigmore Wasteland into the Craigmore Plains, Serenia was deeply involved in this matter. She had also personally volunteered for multiple negotiations and meetings with the elves. [[4596 旁白 neutral]]
    As for why the Ice Saintess, who usually spent her days either killing demons or on her way to kill them, suddenly changed her demeanor, many high-ranking Church officials who didn't know the inside story simply assumed it was due to her strong sense of responsibility. Only a few people, including Anna, knew the truth: the Ice Saintess always had one person on her mind. [[4597 旁白 neutral]]
    That person's name might be a bit sensitive within the Church nowadays. [[4598 旁白 neutral]]
    Princess Serenia, who had been in the meeting just fine, suddenly changed her expression. Before anyone else in the meeting could react, the silver-haired girl rushed out the door. As the Princess's personal nun, Anna naturally followed close behind. [[4599 旁白 neutral]]
    She really couldn't understand what had suddenly happened. What could make the Princess abandon such an important matter, which she had put so much effort into, and leave in such a hurry? [[4600 旁白 surprised]]
    Perhaps only the Princess herself knew the true reason behind it. [[4601 旁白 neutral]]
    Serenia walked as if on the wind, and soon returned to her room. Anna, who had been chasing after her, was breathless. If they weren't almost at their destination, she probably would have been left far behind by the Princess, unable to even see her shadow. [[4602 旁白 neutral]]
    Anna entered the room and, as a habit, helped close the door. [[4603 旁白 neutral]]
    “Click!” [[4604 旁白 neutral]]
    As soon as she heard the sound of the door lock engaging, Anna felt a chill erupt from inside the room. Immediately after, an ice-blue spiritual wall enveloped the entire room. [[4605 旁白 neutral]]
    With such strict secrecy, Anna not only held her breath, but also watched as Serenia quickly walked to the wall, reached out, pulled down the detailed map of the continent hanging there, and with a shake, spread it out completely on the table. [[4606 旁白 neutral]]
    The silver-haired girl stared intently at the meticulously drawn map, as if searching for a particular location. Finally, her eyes lit up. Ice-blue magic gathered at her fingertips, and she drew a circle around a remote area in the empire's interior. [[4607 旁白 neutral]]
    “Phew…” [[4608 旁白 neutral]]
    After doing this, Serenia let out a long breath, as if she had completed something very important. [[4609 旁白 neutral]]
    “Princess, have some water.” [[4610 安娜 neutral]]
    Anna, who had been serving the Saintess closely for some time, timely brought a freshly prepared glass of honey-lemon water and offered it. Serenia took it and drank a mouthful, tilting her head back. [[4611 旁白 neutral]]
    In her own room, Serenia no longer cared about the so-called Saintess's decorum. She gasped for air, looking at the circled spot on the map, her eyes bright. [[4612 旁白 neutral]]
    Anna stood aside, keeping quiet. After becoming the Princess's personal nun, the first secret she learned was to stay by the Princess's side and not ask too many questions about things she shouldn't, unless the Princess brought them up herself. [[4613 旁白 neutral]]
    “Anna.” [[4614 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
    The silent Serenia suddenly spoke. [[4615 旁白 neutral]]
    “I'm here, Princess.” [[4616 安娜 neutral]]
    “Do you remember what happened four years ago?” [[4617 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
    As the silver-haired girl turned to speak, she slightly raised her hand. Anna was about to answer when she noticed a snowflake mark suddenly appearing on the girl's hand. The mark was incredibly familiar, making her recall even more deeply what happened four years ago—the event that completely changed her life… [[4618 旁白 neutral]]
    “Princess, you have news of Master Selen An?” [[4619 安娜 surprised]]
    Anna asked in a surprised voice. [[4620 旁白 neutral]]
    The girl nodded, then lifted her hand to show the mark on its back. [[4621 旁白 neutral]]
    “I sensed it. The mark left on him was triggered, so I could sense his approximate location.” [[4622 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
    As she said this, she took another deep breath, as if a heavy burden that had long weighed on her heart had been lifted. [[4623 旁白 neutral]]
    Finally, finally, she had news of him… [[4624 旁白 happy]]
    She couldn't describe her current feelings with words, as it was a release of complex emotions mixed with countless thoughts. But her greatest feeling at this moment was relief—thankfully, thankfully, he was still alive, still alive… [[4625 旁白 happy]]
    The great war four years ago changed the current dynamics between the Empire, the Demon Clan, and the elves. The Demon Clan's relentless pressure and strong oppression on the Empire were relieved. The Imperial Church seized the opportunity and offered the elves an alliance they couldn't refuse. With these two major powers allied, the Demon Clan had been completely subdued in recent years. [[4626 旁白 neutral]]
    Many in the Empire and the Church attributed this achievement to Serenia, calling her the most accomplished Saintess in recent years. Serenia didn't care about those honors or praises. Her heart was always concerned about that person, the young man named Selen An, and the girl named Loberisia. [[4627 旁白 neutral]]
    Intense longing wove a huge web that enveloped her, causing her to dream of these “two” figures every night. [[4628 旁白 sad]]
    She regretted countless times why she wasn't the one who stood in front of Loberisia that day, fearing whether Loberisia could truly survive facing a Great Demon's soul self-destruction alone. [[4629 旁白 sad]]
    Even though she left a murmur in her ear before leaving, Serenia was still worried. Now, these long-standing worries were finally relieved. [[4630 旁白 neutral]]
    He was still alive, and somewhere in the Empire. [[4631 旁白 neutral]]
    “Princess, please send me to secretly search for Master Selen An.” [[4632 安娜 neutral]]
    While Serenia was still calming her uneasy heart, Anna, who was beside her, had already knelt down, volunteering for the task. [[4633 旁白 neutral]]
    The golden-haired girl, with her head bowed, also had uncontrollable emotions in her eyes. [[4634 旁白 neutral]]
    She could never forget the scene from that day, forgetting the young master she considered the worst in the world standing in front of her, forgetting the impossibly beautiful Saintess holding her in her embrace… [[4635 旁白 neutral]]
    Her feelings towards that person were complex. If it weren't for Selen An, her father wouldn't have died an untimely death, and she and her mother wouldn't have fallen into such poverty. All misfortune began because of him. But what if the young master had never appeared in her life's path? [[4636 旁白 neutral]]
    Would she truly be able to achieve her childhood dream of becoming a glorious holy clergy member, or even the esteemed Princess's personal nun, as she was now? [[4637 旁白 neutral]]
    Because of that incident, Princess Serenia had shown special care for her, her mother, and her younger brother. Now, her mother had fully recovered and was given a decent job at the Church, and her younger brother received good care. Once he grew a little older, he would be directly arranged to study at the Church's affiliated Holy Temple Academy, a higher education institution that many children of minor nobles dreamed of entering. [[4638 旁白 neutral]]
    She had suffered misfortune because of him, but her life had also changed because of him. Now, her feelings towards him were no longer simple hatred or gratitude, but an ineffable complexity. [[4639 旁白 neutral]]
    Serenia looked at Anna, who was half-kneeling on the ground, sighed, and helped her up. [[4640 旁白 neutral]]
    “Anna, I understand how you feel, because my heart is no calmer than yours right now. I have too many things going on recently, and as my personal nun, I truly cannot let you leave.” [[4641 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
    “But this matter…!” [[4642 安娜 neutral]]
    “I already have a suitable person. You don't need to worry.” [[4643 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
    The silver-haired girl said reassuringly, and Anna lowered her head in disappointment. [[4644 旁白 sad]]
    “Knock, knock, knock…” [[4645 旁白 neutral]]
    Just then, a knock came from the door. [[4646 旁白 neutral]]
    A smile appeared on Serenia's face. With a gentle flick of her finger, the closed door opened, revealing a graceful figure standing outside, cool and respectful. [[4647 旁白 neutral]]
    “Sister, I'm here.” [[4648 贝莲娜 neutral]]
