Chapter 28: Reset 28 - Lay Down Your Sword and Be My Wife [[1616 旁白 neutral]]
"You're insane..." [[1617 玛拉 surprised]]
The blunt ceremonial sword went through Mara's body. It was a terrible wound, but she felt no pain. She didn't fight back because all her power was gone. [[1618 旁白 neutral]]
The Sword of Peace was not made for killing, but its purpose was to stop demons. [[1619 旁白 neutral]]
Blood came from the corner of Selen An's mouth. As a newborn demon, not yet strong, a wound through her abdomen was serious enough to kill her. [[1620 旁白 fearful]]
But compared to holding the holy sword, the wound in her abdomen felt like nothing. For a succubus to hold a holy sword brought immediate punishment. Her new skin felt like it was burning on red-hot iron. White smoke rose with the smell of burnt flesh. [[1621 旁白 fearful]]
The pain was unbearable, like being thrown into molten steel. Her skin and bones felt like they were turning to ash under the sword's judgment. [[1622 旁白 fearful]]
Even so, she didn't dare let go of the sword. She had paid a high price for this moment. Selen An knew a beginner couldn't beat an expert. To kill her enemy, she had to use tempting bait. [[1623 旁白 neutral]]
The bait was herself. Whether Mara wanted to kill or capture her, she needed to find a moment to lock them together, making sure neither could escape. Only then could she be sure to strike true. [[1624 旁白 neutral]]
She didn't even know what would happen to her for using the holy sword. A demon touching a holy sword was an insult to the divine. Anyone who broke the rules and insulted the sacred had to pay a terrible price. [[1625 旁白 neutral]]
She was already tasting that price—a pain worse than death. But even so, she had to do it... [[1626 旁白 fearful]]
Watching Mara's face dry up and lose its life, she used her last bit of strength to form a weak but triumphant smile. [[1627 旁白 happy]]
"Mara, I won this time." [[1628 塞伦安 happy]]
Only when the succubus before her was a dried corpse did Selen An try to let go of the sword. But she had held it too long. Her punished hands were nearly burned and stuck to the hilt. [[1629 旁白 fearful]]
She fell weakly into the snow, taking Mara's body with her. The blizzard was ending, and the last few snowflakes fell. The cool drops on her cheek felt refreshing. [[1630 旁白 sad]]
She was so weak she couldn't feel her hands. Her vision turned black, and her eyelids felt heavy as lead. [[1631 旁白 fearful]]
Am I going to die? she wondered. [[1632 塞伦安 fearful]]
[[1633 旁白 neutral]]
Mara was right. What she did was insane. A succubus killing another succubus with a holy sword... whether she succeeded or not, she was doomed to die from the sword's punishment. [[1634 旁白 fearful]]
But she had won her bet. She took Mara with her before she died. It was an extreme plan, but she had to do it... [[1635 旁白 neutral]]
Killing Mara meant she had broken free from the original story's fate. She had changed the future, rewriting destiny with her life and her enemy's blood. [[1636 旁白 happy]]
Heh, in the end, this body's luck wasn't so bad after all... [[1637 塞伦安 happy]]
I wonder if this little change will affect everyone else's fate... [[1638 塞伦安 neutral]]
She heard footsteps in the distance. She had lost too much blood and could only see a blurry shape. It looked like a young woman running toward her, and she could faintly hear someone calling her name. [[1639 旁白 neutral]]
It must be a hallucination... [[1640 塞伦安 sad]]
she thought mockingly as the darkness swallowed her consciousness and the sky grew dim. [[1641 旁白 sad]]
On another battlefield, the extreme cold had killed countless demons. The one who created this ice field was also at her limit. [[1642 旁白 neutral]]
The Saintess leaned on her sword, kneeling in the blood-stained snow. Her sacred dress was torn and damaged, and her silver hair was matted with blood and dirt. [[1643 旁白 sad]]
Her body, which once had almost endless magic, could not produce another drop. She had no idea how many demons she had killed. The number was probably too high to count. [[1644 旁白 neutral]]
But after sending away so many demons, she had no strength left to deal with the most important one. The ground trembled as he walked. His tower-like body approached, and his shadow completely covered the kneeling Serenia. [[1645 旁白 fearful]]
She raised her head to meet the hellish eyes of Demon General Kog'Soth. [[1646 旁白 neutral]]
"Impressive. You killed so many of my soldiers and even my mount, right under my nose. I admire your strength." [[1647 克格萨 neutral]]
The Demon General's voice was hoarse and deep. [[1648 旁白 neutral]]
He knew how terrifying this young woman was. She had single-handedly caused devastating damage to an entire cavalry of demons, all while protecting three burdens. [[1649 旁白 neutral]]
He had watched as the demon cavalry was about to destroy the old wooden hut. Serenia had crushed a space crystal to teleport away that useless woman. [[1650 旁白 neutral]]
She had used her most important life-saving item on a commoner who had nothing to do with her. This left her with only one option: to fight alone in a desperate situation. [[1651 旁白 neutral]]
"..." [[1652 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Serenia showed no reaction to the Demon General's praise. Even her ice-blue eyes were empty of emotion. [[1653 旁白 neutral]]
"A pity. If you had brought your own holy knights, you might have actually won this time." [[1654 克格萨 neutral]]
As the most direct link to the gods, a Saintess not only had divine power but also commanded her own Holy Knight Order. Each knight in this order was personally chosen and blessed by the Saintess herself. [[1655 旁白 neutral]]
It was, in effect, her private army. Their only purpose was to ensure her safety, and not even the Church could command them. [[1656 旁白 neutral]]
He had also heard rumors about the Ice Saintess's Holy Knight Order. In the years since she took her title, the most important position of First Knight had remained empty. This strange fact had attracted the attention of the demon world. [[1657 旁白 neutral]]
As for the reason, perhaps only the Ice Saintess herself knew. [[1658 旁白 neutral]]
Kog'Soth stared deeply at the cold, stubborn girl kneeling on the ground. He admired her, but he also did not hide his desire to possess her. [[1659 旁白 neutral]]
"Daughter of Glacies, your beauty and strength have earned my respect. Especially those stubborn eyes... they truly delight me. So..." [[1660 克格萨 neutral]]
"Lay down your sword and become my wife." [[1661 克格萨 angry]]
Demon General Kog'Soth crossed his arms and made his declaration like a king. [[1662 旁白 neutral]]
Serenia froze. She looked down, her exhausted body trembling. But she still used all her strength to stand up, leaning on her sword. Her blood-stained silver hair blew in the wind. She pulled her sword from the ground, pointed it at Kog'Soth, her ice-blue eyes filled with endless cold. [[1663 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
"In your dreams!" [[1664 瑟蕾妮娅 angry]]
The next second, four dark spears pierced her limbs, nailing her to the ground on her knees. [[1665 旁白 fearful]]
Red blood splattered, and her torn dress fluttered like a canary with broken wings, about to be chained and locked in a cage. [[1666 旁白 sad]]
"I am making a declaration, not asking for your consent." [[1667 克格萨 angry]]
"You will be my wife. This is a fact that cannot be changed. Give up your useless resistance. I will perform a baptism here and grant you the body of my kin..." [[1668 克格萨 angry]]
"Then, you will no longer be the Saintess of the human race, but my own Demon Queen." [[1669 克格萨 angry]]
