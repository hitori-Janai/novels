Chapter 88: Going Home [[4987 旁白 neutral]]
    "Mr. Andre, what is your intention regarding my proposal?" [[4988 墨莺 neutral]]
    The next day, Mo Ying waited for Andre, who was about to go for his morning run, at the door. She stopped him and explained her purpose. [[4989 旁白 neutral]]
    "Although I guessed that Isabella would tell you about this matter, I didn't expect that facing such a big trouble, you wouldn't choose to delay, but instead prepare to face the problem itself?" [[4990 旁白 surprised]]
    While the two were talking, Mo Ying had already set up a wind barrier that ordinary people couldn't see, so the sound of their conversation wouldn't leak out. [[4991 旁白 neutral]]
    "As a holy nun appointed by Her Royal Highness the Saintess, our duty is not only to be loyal to the Saintess, but also in the territory blessed by the God of Wind, every discordant place that might breed darkness is our target." [[4992 墨莺 neutral]]
    Mo Ying answered with a slight smile, but her tone became more businesslike. Andre wondered if it was his misconception, but her attitude towards him had subtly changed... [[4993 旁白 neutral]]
    To describe it in words, it was less intimate than before, but by no means scornful or rude. It simply became more distant. [[4994 旁白 neutral]]
    He didn't know why, but Andre unconsciously breathed a sigh of relief. Keeping a distance was good, staying away from him was good. He was just an ordinary priest, and the dignified Saintess shouldn't pay attention to him. This current state was correct... [[4995 旁白 happy]]
    Moreover, seeing that Her Royal Highness the Saintess was quite responsible, she was preparing to deal with the seal under the church just a few days after arriving. This meant that the burden on him, the priest, would be much lighter. [[4996 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, even a sealed Vampire Grand Duke was a Grand Duke, at least a Fifth Tier, possibly even a Sixth Tier. A slight oversight in operation could very likely lead to a disaster. [[4997 旁白 fearful]]
    Now that the Saintess was taking over this matter, he, the "local," only needed to play a supporting role on the side. His days instantly became relaxed and leisurely. [[4998 旁白 happy]]
    What? You said this is just a freeloader who wins by doing nothing? [[4999 旁白 neutral]]
    No, what's wrong with winning by doing nothing? [[5000 旁白 angry]]
    Since there's a leader carrying him, one more or one less of him doesn't matter. Lying down and enjoying it is the most correct choice right now. Besides, he usually doesn't even have this opportunity when he wants to win by doing nothing~ [[5001 旁白 happy]]
    Andre expressed: [[5002 旁白 neutral]]
    It's good to be a freeloader who wins by doing nothing. He loves being a freeloader, he likes being a freeloader, and he hopes that such games are assigned to him more often. Don't make him do everything himself; it's easy to lose muscle and become effeminate! [[5003 旁白 happy]]
    "I didn't expect Miss Mo Ying to have such awareness. I am ashamed. You are indeed a holy nun personally appointed by Her Royal Highness the Saintess." [[5004 安德烈 surprised]]
    "Then, Mr. Andre, are you willing to lead the way for us?" [[5005 墨莺 neutral]]
    "Of course, the seal buried deep beneath the town is a problem, and it will remain a hidden danger until it's removed. Before, I was insignificant and couldn't handle such a big matter. Now that a holy nun is involved, this is truly my honor, no, the honor of the entire town!" [[5006 安德烈 happy]]
    "May the wind engrave your path!" [[5007 安德烈 happy]]
    Since there was a chance to slack off, Andre naturally agreed with both hands and feet. So, his original plan to keep a distance from Her Royal Highness the Wind Saintess changed, and he became much more complimentary towards the current Wind Saintess. [[5008 旁白 neutral]]
    Such fierce praise surprised Mo Ying. She seemed to be re-evaluating Andre, staring at the man with her bright jade eyes for a while before nodding. [[5009 旁白 neutral]]
    "In that case, I will trouble Mr. Andre. Our people will be fully assembled tonight. Please make a trip to the Grand Cathedral in Roland City and retrieve from the old priest..." [[5010 墨莺 neutral]]
    "No need for such trouble." [[5011 安德烈 neutral]]
    The man interrupted Mo Ying, and under her puzzled gaze, he pulled out two keys from his pocket, one gold and one silver, both with smooth, worn surfaces. [[5012 旁白 neutral]]
    "This... I heard from Isabella that there are two keys in total, one with you, and the other with the old priest far away in Roland City. But why would you..." [[5013 墨莺 surprised]]
    "I misspoke. Actually, the old priest entrusted her key to me before she left. If your conditions permit, we can go deep into the cellar now to find out." [[5014 安德烈 neutral]]
    The man lightly hooked the two sets of keys with his fingers, gleaming with a dazzling metallic luster in the sunlight. [[5015 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is that so..." [[5016 墨莺 neutral]]
    Mo Ying lowered her head and murmured. [[5017 旁白 neutral]]
    "Although it's morning, and sunlight has some restraining effect on vampires, the environment of the cellar is mostly dark and damp, so there isn't much difference between morning and evening. We are not going to open the seal and deal with the monster inside; we are just performing a small relocation of the seal." [[5018 墨莺 neutral]]
    "Miss Mo Ying means that you have a way to directly move this seal?" [[5019 安德烈 surprised]]
    "Yes, that is also the intention of Her Royal Highness the Saintess. We will directly move the seal to the Wind God Grand Cathedral. There, we have enough resources and personnel to completely neutralize the seal." [[5020 墨莺 neutral]]
    "If it is the Saintess's intention, I will naturally obey. But listening to what you just said, besides you and Miss Isabella, are there others who haven't arrived yet?" [[5021 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre narrowed his eyes, catching the detail. [[5022 旁白 neutral]]
    "Yes, in addition to us two Saintesses, she also sent a holy nun from her side. Her Royal Highness the Saintess attaches great importance to the seal under Kempf Town." [[5023 墨莺 neutral]]
    A total of two holy nuns, plus one Saintess—this lineup was much more impressive than Serenia facing the demon cavalry alone back then. [[5024 旁白 neutral]]
    It should be a very reassuring piece of news, but Andre habitually asked cautiously. [[5025 旁白 neutral]]
    "Is it convenient to reveal the name of the holy nun who is about to arrive?" [[5026 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Ahem~ Of course, her name is Serafina. Like Sister Isabella, she is one of the two earliest followers of Her Royal Highness the Saintess, and also the sister most highly regarded by Her Royal Highness the Saintess~" [[5027 墨莺 happy]]
    "In that case, I have no objection. We will act when that holy nun arrives." [[5028 安德烈 neutral]]
    ... [[5029 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[5030 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hey, where's the teacher?" [[5031 陌生男1 surprised]]
    In a side hall of the Roland Grand Cathedral, a white-robed priest looked at the empty room, suddenly asking in confusion. [[5032 旁白 neutral]]
    "Sir Priest, are you looking for Madam Medea?" [[5033 陌生女1 neutral]]
    Behind him, a nun appeared at the opportune moment. [[5034 旁白 neutral]]
    "That's right, I'm looking for Senior Medea. I have an agreement with her to come here every Saturday to learn divine arts from her, but today..." [[5035 陌生男1 sad]]
    "Sir Priest, I'm very sorry, Madam Medea has already left." [[5036 陌生女1 sad]]
    "Left?" [[5037 陌生男1 surprised]]
    The young priest furrowed his brows. Medea was the senior he respected most in the church. Over the years, he had been able to become a formal priest so quickly, thanks to the help and guidance of this senior priest. [[5038 旁白 neutral]]
    However, Senior Medea was transferred to the Roland Grand Cathedral midway, and coupled with her advanced age, the church internally didn't pay much attention to this suddenly joined old priest. [[5039 旁白 neutral]]
    Logically speaking, if nothing unexpected happened, the teacher should have spent the rest of her life peacefully under the church's care. Due to being neglected, the church would never assign her any tasks. This sudden disappearance without any reason immediately gave him a bad feeling. [[5040 旁白 fearful]]
    The next second, the nun's voice reappeared. [[5041 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, by the way, Madam Medea asked me to tell you something before she left." [[5042 陌生女1 neutral]]
    "She said there isn't much more she can teach you, and in the coming days, Sir Priest, you need to go and study deeply. There's no need to worry, because she's going home..." [[5043 陌生女1 neutral]]
