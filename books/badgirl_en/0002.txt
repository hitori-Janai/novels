Chapter 2: Reset 2: A Humiliating Plot [[60 旁白 neutral]]
    Facing Mara, the governess-nun's thoughtful comfort. [[61 旁白 neutral]]
    Was he moved? [[62 旁白 neutral]]
    He dared not move. Selen An truly dared not move! [[63 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Please, the pain and the bone-deep itch just now were so real that it ruled out the possibility of it being a dream. If his guess was correct, he was now just a useless young master with no combat ability. Standing before him, this seemingly withered old nun... [[64 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Was actually a ruthless Succubus! [[65 旁白 fearful]]
    Don't think that the Succubi here are like those in the suggestive anime seen by the masses, only knowing how to extract essence and offer benefits. All demons on the Niflheim Continent, in the game's setting, were considered absolute devils! [[66 旁白 fearful]]
    They reveled in slaughter, enjoyed pleasure, craved flesh and blood, and were ruthlessly bloodthirsty. In short, if one truly angered a demon without the means to protect oneself, there would absolutely be no good outcome. [[67 旁白 fearful]]
    Selen An did not want to experience the horrific sight of being completely drained of his essence and then dismembered immediately after transmigrating. [[68 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Even if he wasn't completely consumed, it might trigger the corruption plot prematurely, which would be even more terrifying. The corruption of female characters was a great humiliation for the characters themselves, and now he, a man, was about to enjoy this "honor." [[69 塞伦安 fearful]]
    The thought that this body might eventually indulge in pleasure atop a giant demon in a depraved demon den made him shiver with disgust. [[70 塞伦安 fearful]]
    The first reaction of a person facing danger is always to flee, but before a Succubus, how could he, an ordinary person, escape? [[71 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Rely on the two guards outside the carriage? [[72 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Don't be ridiculous. First of all, as an old player of this game, he had no impression of those two voices at all. No impression meant that those two guys were almost useless NPCs. Relying on ordinary NPCs to counter-kill mid-game elite monsters? [[73 塞伦安 neutral]]
    He wouldn't even dream of doing that! [[74 塞伦安 surprised]]
    So what should he do? [[75 塞伦安 neutral]]
    To save his life, he could only endure! [[76 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Selen An remembered a saying he heard before he transmigrated: "Put on your socks before your shoes, be a grandson before you're a grandpa." [[77 旁白 neutral]]
    Endure for a bit; his life was paramount in the grand scheme of things! [[78 塞伦安 neutral]]
    “I’m fine… Mara…” [[79 塞伦安 neutral]]
    Selen An pretended to be weak, leaning against the carriage wall, allowing the old nun to stroke the bump on his forehead with ill intent. In reality, he was truly very weak. [[80 旁白 neutral]]
    By displaying the exact same weak and useless demeanor as the original owner, making Mara mistakenly believe he was still the indecisive, flustered, and useless young master, the old nun, who was still extremely oppressive even without revealing her true form, finally temporarily left the carriage. [[81 旁白 neutral]]
    As long as she felt that she still held the initiative, Mara should not notice anything unusual. [[82 旁白 neutral]]
    Silence temporarily returned to the carriage. He lay almost collapsed on the soft cushion, wiping the sweat from his forehead, while his mind sorted through his chaotic thoughts. [[83 旁白 neutral]]
    The original owner of this body had been secretly implanted with the Succubus Seed by this old nun a long time ago. This item, capable of transforming sentient races and twisting souls, could subtly corrupt a person before being fully activated. [[84 旁白 neutral]]
    Fortunately, he was a man. If this Succubus Seed had been implanted into a woman's body, she probably wouldn't have lasted so long, and her mind would have been twisted, her body and soul completely corrupted long ago. [[85 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, this was the world of an adult game, which was somewhat unfriendly to women. [[86 旁白 neutral]]
    But even if he was a man and had some resistance to the Succubus Seed, it wouldn't last long. As everyone knew, Succubi were only female, never male, and he, having been implanted with the Succubus Seed, would subtly and continuously transform into a female Succubus. [[87 旁白 neutral]]
    How to remove the Succubus Seed became the top priority, but there was something even more important right now: how to escape. [[88 旁白 neutral]]
    He had a ticking time bomb inside him, but at least it hadn't exploded yet. As long as he disrupted the plot to a certain extent, he could probably maintain his human form, and that was enough. [[89 旁白 neutral]]
    The so-called Succubus Seed was actually a kind of curse, and the Winterlein family, to which this body belonged, specialized in purification magic. The original owner's sudden escape with Mara would surely attract the family's attention, and the family would not allow such a direct descendant to wander outside; they would definitely send people to search for him. [[90 旁白 neutral]]
    As long as he had a chance to escape, if he ran back along the route, he would definitely encounter the family's people. [[91 旁白 neutral]]
    Once he returned to the family, the family's power would protect him and simultaneously purify the Succubus curse within him, resolving the crisis. [[92 旁白 neutral]]
    But the conversation kept circling back to the starting point: how could he escape under the nose of a ferocious and lustful Succubus? [[93 塞伦安 concerned]]
    The two useless NPCs outside the carriage had already been eliminated. Now, it seemed the only one he could rely on was the Ice Saintess, Serenia Glacies, who was relentlessly pursuing him, and who was also the original owner's childhood friend. [[94 旁白 neutral]]
    Unlike him, Serenia was one of the Saintesses most skilled in combat. Her combat power was incredibly high. At this moment, she was pursuing him alone, and killing a Succubus would be effortless for her. [[95 旁白 neutral]]
    But the problem was, in the adult game's plot, he, the villainous young master, had already become an incorrigible scumbag in the eyes of his childhood friend, the Saintess. Even the Ice God had issued a Divine Oracle, demanding his death as a human traitor who defiled the Water God's faith. [[96 旁白 fearful]]
    In short, his current situation was that he was unwelcome everywhere. The Saintess wanted to kill him, and the Demons wanted him to be corrupted. It seemed neither side was beneficial, but with Selen An's deep understanding of the game's plot and character designs, at this seemingly two-sided impasse, he could only start with Serenia. [[97 旁白 neutral]]
    This Ice Saintess, renowned throughout the continent, was labeled as an ice beauty, pure and untainted, a high-mountain flower, and various other terms. Beneath her seemingly cold and unapproachable exterior, however, lay a maiden's heart longing for affection and warmth. [[98 旁白 neutral]]
    To put it simply, she was the quintessential outwardly cold but inwardly warm type. Coupled with their childhood friend relationship, Selen An felt he could take a gamble. [[99 旁白 neutral]]
    If he won, his bicycle would turn into a motorcycle; he would return to the grand family completely unharmed, and in the future, he could accumulate good deeds and change his image as a profligate scion, enjoying all the privileges of nobility for the rest of his life. The only cost might be to work hard and produce more offspring to propagate this dwindling direct bloodline. [[100 旁白 neutral]]
    But was this a cost for a modern person? [[101 塞伦安 happy]]
    This was clearly enjoyment! [[102 塞伦安 happy]]
    The Saintess family would undoubtedly provide him with a noble and beautiful aristocratic lady as a marriage partner. Wouldn't this life be much better than his original world, where he spent his days relying on his five fingers? [[103 塞伦安 happy]]
    As for losing? [[104 旁白 neutral]]
    That would be another R-rated scene. Either immediate death, or being caught by demons and then death would become a luxury. [[105 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Selen An clearly remembered that in the original plot, the original owner of this body not only degenerated into a female Succubus before his childhood friend's eyes but also dragged the pure Serenia down with him, turning her into a tool for the Demons to toy with. [[106 旁白 fearful]]
    As a result, in later plot CGs, these two "sisters" who had both become Succubi led the Demon army to attack their former allies, and then, before the city gates, they were singled out by the demon generals and subjected to various unspeakable acts. [[107 旁白 fearful]]
    Because this incident dealt a heavy blow to the Saintess Alliance, it triggered a series of chain reactions, leading to the subsequent fall of four more Saintesses, and the entire world became the Demons' "playground." [[108 旁白 fearful]]
    No, no, he absolutely could not let it get to that point! [[109 塞伦安 fearful]]
    But what power did he, being so weak, have to rewrite the plot? [[110 塞伦安 fearful]]
    Just as Selen An was getting agitated, a golden light suddenly flashed before his eyes. Just as he thought he was seeing things due to his agitation, the light solidified before him, transforming into a golden virtual panel under his breathless gaze. [[111 旁白 surprised]]
    P.S.: This work does not contain many system elements. Readers can consider this system-like element as a setting; in any case, the main plot has little to do with system-flow novels. [[112 旁白 neutral]]
