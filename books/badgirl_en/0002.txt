Chapter 2: Reset 2 - A Humiliating Plot [[60 旁白 neutral]]
Faced with such kind comfort from Governess Mara. [[61 旁白 neutral]]
Was he moved? [[62 塞伦安 neutral]]
He wasn't moved, he was frozen. Selen An truly didn't dare to move! [[63 塞伦安 fearful]]
Come on, the pain and the bone-deep itch just now were so real, it couldn't have been a dream. If his guess was right, then he was just a powerless, weak young master, and this old governess who looked so withered... [[64 塞伦安 fearful]]
...was actually a succubus who could kill without blinking an eye! [[65 塞伦安 fearful]]
Don't think the succubi here are like the ones in lewd anime, who only know how to drain people and provide fan service. In the game's setting, all demons were considered absolute evil! [[66 塞伦安 neutral]]
They loved to kill, enjoyed pleasure, craved flesh and blood, and were merciless. In short, if you angered a demon without any way to protect yourself, you would definitely meet a terrible end. [[67 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An didn't want to be drained of his essence and then torn apart right after transmigrating. [[68 塞伦安 fearful]]
Even if he wasn't completely consumed, he might trigger the "Corruption" plotline early, which was even more terrifying. For a female character, corruption was a huge humiliation, and now he, a man, was about to receive this "special honor." [[69 塞伦安 fearful]]
The thought of this body one day sitting on some troll's lap in a depraved demon den, having "fun," sent a chill down his spine. [[70 塞伦安 fearful]]
A person's first reaction to danger is always to run, but how could a normal person like him escape from a succubus? [[71 塞伦安 fearful]]
Rely on the two guards outside the carriage? [[72 塞伦安 neutral]]
Don't be ridiculous. As a veteran player of this game, he didn't recognize their voices at all, which meant they were probably useless NPCs. Rely on regular NPCs to defeat a mid-game elite monster? [[73 塞伦安 neutral]]
He wouldn't even dare to dream of it! [[74 塞伦安 neutral]]
So what should he do? [[75 塞伦安 fearful]]
If he wanted to save his life, he had to lay low! [[76 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An remembered a saying from before he transmigrated: "First be a servant, then you can be a master." [[77 塞伦安 neutral]]
He had to endure for now. The bigger picture could wait; his life was what mattered most! [[78 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I'm alright... Mara..." [[79 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An pretended to be weak, leaning against the carriage wall and letting the old governess stroke the bump on his forehead with ill intentions. In reality, he really was very weak. [[80 旁白 neutral]]
By showing the same weak and useless expression as the original owner, making Mara think he was still that same indecisive, panicky good-for-nothing, the imposing old governess finally left the carriage for a while. [[81 旁白 neutral]]
As long as she felt she was still in control, Mara probably wouldn't notice anything unusual. [[82 塞伦安 neutral]]
The carriage fell silent again for a moment. He lay on the soft cushion, almost completely exhausted, wiping the sweat from his forehead while trying to sort out his chaotic thoughts. [[83 旁白 neutral]]
A long time ago, the old governess had secretly planted a Succubus Seed in this body's original owner. Before being fully activated, this item, which could change a creature's race and twist its soul, could slowly cause a person to undergo Corruption. [[84 旁白 neutral]]
Luckily, he was a man. If this Succubus Seed had been planted in a woman's body, she probably wouldn't have lasted this long and would have already had her mind twisted and her body and soul completely corrupted. [[85 塞伦安 neutral]]
After all, this was the world of an H-game, which was a bit too unfriendly towards women. [[86 塞伦安 neutral]]
But even though he was male and had some resistance to the Succubus Seed, he couldn't hold out for long. As everyone knew, the succubus race only had females, no males. Having been planted with a Succubus Seed, he would slowly but surely transform into a female succubus. [[87 塞伦安 fearful]]
How to remove the Succubus Seed was his top priority, but there was something even more urgent right now: how to escape. [[88 塞伦安 fearful]]
He had a ticking time bomb inside him, but at least it hadn't gone off yet. As long as he could disrupt the plot to some extent, he could probably remain human-like, and that was enough. [[89 塞伦安 neutral]]
The so-called Succubus Seed was basically a type of curse, and this body's Winterlein Family was skilled in purification magic. The original owner's sudden escape with Mara would definitely attract the family's attention. The family wouldn't let their only direct heir wander around outside and would surely send people to find him. [[90 塞伦安 neutral]]
As long as he had a chance to escape and ran back along the route they came, he would definitely run into people from his family. [[91 塞伦安 happy]]
Once he returned to his family, their power would protect him and also purify the succubus curse in his body. The crisis would be solved. [[92 塞伦安 happy]]
But the question came back to the starting point: how could he escape from under the nose of a ferocious, lustful succubus? [[93 塞伦安 fearful]]
The two useless NPCs outside the carriage had already been ruled out. For now, the only person he could possibly use was the Ice Saintess who was chasing him relentlessly, who was also this body's childhood friend, Serenia Glacies. [[94 塞伦安 neutral]]
Unlike him, Serenia was one of the most combat-proficient among all the Saintesses. Her combat power was off the charts. At this moment, chasing him all by herself, killing a succubus would be effortless for her. [[95 塞伦安 neutral]]
But the problem was, in the game's plot, this villainous young master had already become an irredeemable scumbag in the eyes of his childhood friend, the Saintess. Even the God of Ice had issued a divine oracle demanding his death as a human traitor who had defiled the faith of the Water God. [[96 塞伦安 fearful]]
In short, his current situation was terrible from all sides. The Saintess wanted to kill him, and the demons wanted him to fall into corruption. It seemed like there was no good option, but based on Selen An's deep understanding of the game's plot and characters, he had to approach Serenia in this seemingly hopeless situation. [[97 塞伦安 neutral]]
This famous Ice Saintess of the continent was known by many titles like "Ice Beauty," "pure and noble," and "untouchable flower." But beneath that cold, unapproachable exterior was a young girl's heart that longed for affection and warmth. [[98 塞伦安 neutral]]
To put it simply, she was a classic example of "cold on the outside, warm on the inside." Plus, they had a childhood friendship. Selen An felt it was worth taking a gamble. [[99 塞伦安 neutral]]
If he won the bet, he'd turn his situation around completely. He would return to his great family unharmed, and in the future, he could do good deeds to change his image as a spoiled villain. For the rest of his life, he could enjoy all the privileges of being a noble. The only price might be having to work hard to produce a few heirs to continue the dwindling direct bloodline. [[100 塞伦安 happy]]
But for a modern person, was that really a price to pay? [[101 塞伦安 happy]]
This was clearly a reward! [[102 塞伦安 happy]]
The marriage partners his Saintess family would offer him would surely be noble ladies of high status and great beauty. Such a life was much better than his old one where he had to rely on "Miss Five Fingers." [[103 塞伦安 happy]]
And if he lost? [[104 塞伦安 fearful]]
That would be another X-rated scene. Either he would die immediately, or he would be captured alive by the demons, making even death a luxury. [[105 塞伦安 fearful]]
Selen An clearly remembered that in the original plot, this body's previous owner not only degenerated into a female succubus in front of his childhood friend, but in the end, he also dragged the pure Serenia down with him, and they both became tools for the demons' amusement. [[106 塞伦安 fearful]]
This led to later CG scenes where these two "sisters," who had both become succubi, led the demon army to attack their former allies. Then, at the city gates, they were singled out by the demon generals and subjected to all sorts of unspeakable acts. [[107 塞伦安 fearful]]
Because this incident was a heavy blow to the Saintess Alliance, it caused a chain reaction that led to the subsequent fall of four other Saintesses, turning the entire world into the demons' "playground." [[108 塞伦安 fearful]]
No, no, it absolutely cannot get to that point! [[109 塞伦安 fearful]]
But what power did his weak self have to rewrite the plot? [[110 塞伦安 fearful]]
Just as Selen An was about to lose his cool from anxiety, a golden light flashed before his eyes. Just when he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him from the stress, the light froze in front of him. As he watched, holding his breath in shock, it turned into a golden virtual panel. [[111 塞伦安 surprised]]
PS: This work does not contain too many system elements. Readers can treat this system-like element as a part of the setting. In any case, the main plot has little to do with system-flow novels. [[112 旁白 neutral]]
