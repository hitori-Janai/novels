Chapter 104: The Old Woman [[6160 旁白 neutral]]
"I guess you must be the current Water Saintess, right?" [[6161 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"I am not at liberty to answer your question." [[6162 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia seemed to be refusing Kayetana's question, but most of her attention was on the golden panel that only she could see. [[6163 旁白 neutral]]
... [[6164 旁白 neutral]]
... [[6165 旁白 neutral]]
Treasure: [[6166 旁白 neutral]]
Sword of Peace (Unsealed) [Proof of the Water God's proxy, symbolizing peace, never sharpened. "A blade without an edge, for true peace requires no slaughter" —engraved on the hilt is the first Saintess's teardrop-shaped Eye of the Water God.] [[6167 旁白 neutral]]
Awakening One: [[6168 旁白 neutral]]
[Divine Retribution] (Effect cannot be described) [[6169 旁白 neutral]]
"For those who raise a blade against the god's mercy, the blades of all spirits shall be their shackles." [[6170 旁白 neutral]]
Awakening Two: [[6171 旁白 neutral]]
[Raging Tides] (Effect cannot be described) [[6172 旁白 neutral]]
"Water is gentle, but it also has its fury. May the overwhelming flood wash away the world's filth." [[6173 旁白 neutral]]
Awakening Three: (Conditions not met) [[6174 旁白 neutral]]
... [[6175 旁白 neutral]]
... [[6176 旁白 neutral]]
Without her realizing it, the holy sword's second awakening had been unlocked. Even Lobelia didn't know what the condition was, but the sealed skill slot had simply opened on its own. [[6177 旁白 surprised]]
Just like the first skill, the description was mysterious. It didn't explain the specifics, leaving you to guess the actual effect. [[6178 旁白 neutral]]
But looking at this skill, Lobelia felt a strange sense of understanding. Her intuition told her that once she used it for the first time, the brand of this body and identity would be imprinted even more deeply onto her soul. [[6179 旁白 fearful]]
Each skill was based on the properties of water. Unlocking an awakening meant she understood water more deeply. In a daze, a perfect, azure water silhouette appeared before her eyes, its back identical to Lobelia's. [[6180 旁白 neutral]]
The more she relied on the power of the Water Saintess, the closer she would inevitably get to that figure, until she completely became her. [[6181 旁白 fearful]]
In reality, Lobelia took a deep breath and dispersed the hazy water light around the holy sword, changing her posture from leaning on it to caressing it. [[6182 旁白 neutral]]
Sensing the subtle change in the girl's aura, Kayetana gave a wicked smile and lightly licked her lips. [[6183 旁白 neutral]]
"Hmm, it seems I guessed right. I've seen that holy sword before, a dull blade that symbolizes peace." [[6184 卡耶塔娜 happy]]
Before she could finish her sentence, Kayetana's figure flickered again. Bright starlight exploded where she had been standing, adding several new craters to the ground. [[6185 旁白 neutral]]
She reappeared a short distance away, the arrogant blood noble looking impatiently at Medea, who had attacked her. [[6186 旁白 neutral]]
"You're so annoying. Can't you see I'm talking to our distinguished guest?" [[6187 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
"Kayetana, have you mistaken something? I am your target. But since you escaped, you've ignored me time and again. In your eyes, is this descendant of a witch so weak that I can be ignored?" [[6188 梅黛亚 angry]]
The once-gentle, white-haired priestess's voice was now clearly filled with anger. This emotion wasn't faked to get Kayetana's attention; it erupted from the bottom of her heart. [[6189 旁白 angry]]
Medea just didn't understand. She was the descendant of the witch, one of the two who had sealed Kayetana. Logically, shouldn't a blood duchess sealed for a thousand years seek revenge on her old enemies the moment she was free? [[6190 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, her ancestor, the Red-Haired Witch, was dead, but wasn't she still alive? When an old rival is dead, isn't it normal demonic logic to transfer that hatred to their descendants? [[6191 旁白 neutral]]
From the moment Kayetana escaped, Medea had prepared to face the full wrath of the Tier 6 powerhouse who once ruled half of Windermere. But apart from the very first attack that missed Lobelia and came for her, everything had gone completely wrong. [[6192 旁白 frustrated]]
Ever since she discovered Lobelia could force a ceasefire, all of Kayetana's attention had been stolen away! [[6193 旁白 frustrated]]
It felt like you were a hunter training your hound. You put a piece of fresh meat in the designated spot, expecting the hound to rush over and enjoy its meal. Instead, the damn dog charged out, but in the direction of the latrine you just used... [[6194 旁白 frustrated]]
Well, in a way, she did get her "tasty meal," but the sense of absurdity created a huge gap in the heart of Medea, who was over fifty years old. She had tried to adjust her mindset, telling herself that battlefields are ever-changing and there would always be things she couldn't predict. A mistake was a mistake, and she would just draw the aggro back later. But then... [[6195 旁白 frustrated]]
She had launched two sneak attacks, both grand and powerful, summoning the power of the stars with maxed-out special effects and damage. She thought she could surely pull the aggro this time, but Kayetana acted as if she couldn't even see her, completely ignoring her! [[6196 旁白 angry]]
For a warrior who had put their life on the line, being ignored is the greatest insult! [[6197 旁白 angry]]
The self-control she had cultivated for decades was shattered by Kayetana today. [[6198 旁白 angry]]
"Oh? Didn't I already give you some attention?" [[6199 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
Looking at the furious witch, Kayetana raised an eyebrow in slight surprise, her tone dripping with arrogance. [[6200 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"I don't deny that your talent is no less than your ancestor's. But you are too old, a hag with one foot already in the grave. Without life force and vitality, in my eyes, you are hardly even qualified to have your blood sucked." [[6201 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
The light words fell into her ears, and Medea felt her fists harden. [[6202 旁白 angry]]
Ever since she became the priestess of this town, she had never been angry. But today, an undead old monster who had been sealed underground by her ancestor jumped out of the dirt and pointed at her nose, calling her an old woman! [[6203 旁白 angry]]
This is absolutely intolerable! [[6204 旁白 angry]]
Watching from a distance, Lobelia suddenly had a bad feeling. She wiped the fine beads of sweat from her forehead and called out worriedly. [[6205 旁白 fearful]]
"Grandma Medea..." [[6206 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
"Evelyn, stand back. Don't get hurt." [[6207 梅黛亚 angry]]
The kind priestess's voice was ice-cold. She gripped her holy silver scepter tightly, her clear, wine-red eyes seeming to ignite with some power. The power of countless stars began to gather around her body. Her long, white hair, marked by age, flew up as a fiery red began to emerge against the flow of time. [[6208 旁白 surprised]]
"Oh? Drawing on the power of the stars, using their secret arts to return your body to its peak for a short time. If so, this is getting more and more interesting." [[6209 卡耶塔娜 happy]]
Kayetana's eyes reflected the brilliantly exploding starlight, looking like she was just enjoying the show, even though she herself was at the center of the "show." [[6210 旁白 neutral]]
Lobelia's eyes widened in disbelief. In the starlight, the priestess with completely white hair was visibly growing younger! [[6211 旁白 surprised]]
Her loose, wrinkled skin became supple and firm again. Her withered figure regained its curves. Her pale white hair seemed to be dyed with the "blood" of a rose, vibrant and fiery. [[6212 旁白 surprised]]
"The Red-Haired Witch..." [[6213 洛蓓莉娅 surprised]]
She murmured the title of the witch she had heard from Kayetana earlier. At this moment, she felt the title was exceptionally fitting. [[6214 旁白 neutral]]
PS: Dears, please wait a moment. I'm busy with family matters today and have no drafts on hand, so the update will be late, but not a single word of the promised amount will be missing. Please understand. [[6215 旁白 neutral]]
