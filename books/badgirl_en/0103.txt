Chapter 103: Stalemate [[6056 旁白 neutral]]
A crimson comet fell from the sky to the mortal world. [[6057 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom!" [[6058 旁白 neutral]]
Debris and dust splashed. The gray mist raised by the impact blocked the view. Loberia quickly summoned her Holy Sword as a support to maintain balance. She was about to check on Grandma Medea beside her when a腥风 tore through the gray mist, and a cherry-colored figure broke through the air. [[6059 旁白 neutral]]
Due to the extreme speed, Loberia couldn't even see the true face of the figure, only catching the cherry-pink afterimage. [[6060 旁白 neutral]]
The attack was not aimed at her, but behind her... [[6061 旁白 neutral]]
Her mind quickly made a judgment, but her body's muscle memory had already responded. [[6062 旁白 neutral]]
"No War." [[6063 旁白 neutral]]
The Will of No War activated instantly. [[6064 旁白 neutral]]
Facing attacks within her control, Loberia never panicked. She wasn't afraid of enemies not attacking, only of them wasting her time. [[6065 旁白 neutral]]
If an enemy actively attacks, they will surely fall into the restrictions of the Will of No War. Most intelligent beings will instinctively panic when facing the strange situation of being unable to attack for the first time, and then the initiative will automatically fall into her hands. [[6066 旁白 neutral]]
So, feel free to attack her! [[6067 旁白 neutral]]
Silently, ripples of no war spread in the center of the girl's sky-blue teardrop eyes. The figure, which shot out like a bullet, drastically slowed down as if entering water with increased resistance. [[6068 旁白 neutral]]
"Clang!" [[6069 旁白 neutral]]
As sparks flew, the cherry-pink figure finally collided with Medea, who had stood up. Slender, sharp nails clashed with the ancient Holy Silver Scepter. Their first encounter, under Loberia's friendly restriction, was barely a draw. [[6070 旁白 neutral]]
"Ugh!" [[6071 洛蓓莉娅 sad]]
The blue-haired girl grunted, furrowing her brows as she clutched her chest. This was the first time she had felt this way. It was like trying to stop a high-speed bullet with a rubber pad; although the bullet was effectively slowed down, the rubber pad was greatly deformed and took on a large load at once. [[6072 旁白 fearful]]
Although this uncomfortable feeling didn't affect her much in the short term, if she were to endure the load multiple times consecutively, the restriction effect of the Will of No War might be forcibly "torn apart." [[6073 旁白 fearful]]
Thinking of this, cold sweat trickled down the girl's forehead for the first time, and her signature gentle smile became somewhat strained. [[6074 旁白 fearful]]
Oh no, a fifth-tier against a sixth-tier, even with a strong control mechanism, is it still a bit difficult? [[6075 旁白 fearful]]
At the same time, Medea, who had just finished her first exchange, immediately leaped back to create distance after blocking the attack. The attacking figure stood stunned, looking at her palm. [[6076 旁白 surprised]]
"Strange, why do I feel a strange power forcibly suppressed my killing intent just now?" [[6077 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
Unlike her slightly petite figure, her voice was deeper and more aggressive. [[6078 旁白 neutral]]
Loli voice, mature tone? [[6079 旁白 surprised]]
As this thought arose in Loberia's mind, her spirit seemed to be stimulated, and she suddenly jolted. She subconsciously retreated, striking a defensive pose. [[6080 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
"As expected, was it your trick?" [[6081 洛蓓莉娅 angry]]
Duke Cayetana, having fully turned around, gazed intently at the girl, who was as wary as a rabbit. Taking this opportunity, Loberia finally got her first complete look at the Blood Clan Grand Duke, who had been sealed for a thousand years— [[6082 旁白 neutral]]
It was truly unimaginable that a vampire duke, who had been sealed in slumber for a thousand years, would not only be petite but also appear to be a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl with a childlike face. Her cherry-colored long hair, except for two strands tied into ponytails with bat hair clips, flowed freely. Her exquisite, doll-like face had the typical blood-red vertical pupils and fangs of a vampire. [[6083 旁白 neutral]]
However, unlike her delicate and youthful appearance, her clothing constantly exuded a retro maturity and majesty. Her fair, petite body was clad in a Gothic dress with black and red as its main colors. Beneath her white sleeves were a pair of tender white hands, a slit cape, and a pair of long black boots covering her slender legs. [[6084 旁白 neutral]]
The clash of black and red in the color scheme, and the contrast of youthfulness and maturity in her appearance and temperament, made this famous Duke Cayetana radiate a contradictory beauty. Under her lovely face lay the majesty of a superior. Her eyes were upturned, and her expression was full of arrogance and laziness. [[6085 旁白 neutral]]
Being stared at directly by a sixth-tier vampire, Loberia felt unprecedented pressure. Unlike her confrontation with Kgsar, although there was only one tier difference between fifth and sixth tiers, this sense of oppression was very real. [[6086 旁白 fearful]]
As Loberia pondered in silence, the childlike vampire duke seemed to discover something interesting again. She tilted her head and let out a soft "Hmm?" [[6087 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
"Oh, this is interesting. Even though I suppress you with a difference in rank, you can ignore the rank suppression effect and even suppress and restrain me instead?" [[6088 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
Neither a werewolf nor a witch, except for these two races inherently incompatible with vampires who could, to some extent, ignore the bloodline oppression of vampires, the reaction of this unfamiliar fifth-tier girl clearly caught her attention. [[6089 旁白 neutral]]
"Hey, human, you're very interesting. Tell me your name." [[6090 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"What if I don't, Miss Cayetana?" [[6091 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Loberia concealed the true appearance of the Holy Sword in her hand with water light, meeting the Blood Clan Duke's aggressive gaze neither humbly nor arrogantly. [[6092 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh~ You can call out my surname, which means you know me. And you dare to speak to me like this even knowing me..." [[6093 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
The cherry-haired vampire girl curved her lips. With a wave of her hand, her pink hair behind her fluttered freely. [[6094 旁白 neutral]]
If it were her original personality, a lowly human would have their head detached from their body the next second for daring to speak to her in such a tone. But perhaps because she had just awakened from her seal, facing such a disrespectful human, she couldn't muster even a hint of killing intent. Her intrigued eyes were filled with desire. [[6095 旁白 neutral]]
Newly awakened, she naturally craved fresh blood. When facing this blue-haired girl for the first time, the possessiveness she felt at first sight was equal to her body's instinctive craving for blood. [[6096 旁白 neutral]]
"If it were before, you would have died a hundred times over for those words just now." [[6097 卡耶塔娜 angry]]
"So, I said it. Are you going to kill me?" [[6098 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Cayetana remembered that this unfamiliar girl had held a uniquely shaped sword before. Now, the sword's appearance was enveloped in a layer of hazy water light, like a misty fire poker, making it unclear. [[6099 旁白 neutral]]
The girl's hands were clasped together on the base of the sword hilt, her legs slightly apart, in a stance of propping the sword. [[6100 旁白 neutral]]
"Of course..." [[6101 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
She was about to habitually threaten, but she stopped as if something had inexplicably triggered a nerve. [[6102 旁白 surprised]]
"No, I won't kill you. You're very interesting. Even if you offend me, I will forgive you~" [[6103 卡耶塔娜 happy]]
With that, she looked around. The completely unfamiliar environment made her feel a bit emotional. [[6104 旁白 neutral]]
"My ancient castle is gone, and all my former followers have disappeared. Now that I have awakened, I must reclaim everything I once had, one by one. And now, I happen to be in need of a personal maid, and I think you're quite good~" [[6105 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
As soon as her voice fell, Loberia felt a blur before her eyes, and two completely different voices sounded in her left and right ears. [[6106 旁白 surprised]]
"Watch out!" [[6107 梅黛亚 fearful]]
"Then it's you!" [[6108 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
The cherry-colored figure instantly appeared before her. The distance between them was so close that Loberia could even clearly see the triumphant smile on Cayetana's face. [[6109 旁白 neutral]]
Perhaps in her eyes, she was already in her palm, unable to escape? [[6110 旁白 neutral]]
But why escape? [[6111 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
As the distance between them grew shorter, Cayetana's hand, reaching for Loberia's neck, slowed down more and more, as if the air grew thicker the closer she got to the girl. Finally, just an inch away, she completely stopped. [[6112 旁白 neutral]]
Cayetana's blood-red eyes narrowed slightly, but soon, a fierce glint flashed, and she forcefully tried to pierce the seemingly咫尺 distance with her hand. However, her fingertips not only failed to touch the girl's delicate skin, but a "crack" of bone fracture came from the air. [[6113 旁白 fearful]]
Under the brain's forceful command and the body's instinctive resistance, the finger bones bore the collision of these two forces, twisting and breaking, as if they had hit an impenetrable steel plate in the air. [[6114 旁白 fearful]]
Their sky-blue and crimson pupils met. Cayetana was surprised to find that through the other's eyes, she couldn't detect any fear or panic. This mysterious girl seemed to have no emotional波动 at all from being ambushed. Her sky-blue eyes were like the boundless sea, and the sea's tranquility could not be easily shaken by a few ripples. [[6115 旁白 neutral]]
Realizing she couldn't succeed this time, she quickly retreated, and the strong sense of stagnation disappeared. Landing, she shook her injured arm with twisted knuckles. Her severely injured fingers made a few crisp bone sounds and recovered in the blink of an eye. [[6116 旁白 neutral]]
"What an interesting ability. Your eyes remind me of someone." [[6117 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"Miss Cayetana, if you weren't so aggressive towards me, I imagine there would be less trouble." [[6118 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Witnessing a sixth-tier vampire launch a surprise attack on her with a blank expression, it was impossible not to be nervous. However, the miraculous power flowing through her body seemed to give her a forced calmness of mind, no matter how intense her emotions were, they would quickly subside like a mud ox entering the sea. [[6119 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm truly becoming more and more interested in you, unknown human girl. I've seen those unique teardrop eyes of yours on certain sacred artifacts in temples. I remember I even captured some holy personnel and interrogated them about the meaning of carving such eyes on vessels, and the answer I got was..." [[6120 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"That is the divine emblem symbolizing the gods." [[6121 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
Under the night sky, the pink-haired Blood Clan Grand Duke stood elegantly and unrestrainedly, her index finger gently resting on her chin. Her lazy demeanor even showed a hint of childlike innocence. [[6122 旁白 neutral]]
"Clang!" [[6123 旁白 neutral]]
Attacks from both front and back collided, unleashing a powerful wave of air. Cayetana caught the simultaneous attacks from in front and behind with both hands. The ground beneath her feet cracked due to the concentrated burst of power. [[6124 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, you're giving up your advantageous field and actively attacking me instead?" [[6125 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
Cayetana caught Loberia's slash with one hand. Their red and blue pupils met again at an extremely close distance, reflecting each other's colors. [[6126 旁白 neutral]]
As an old monster who had lived for at least a thousand years, Cayetana's combat experience was certainly extremely rich. With only a limited number of exchanges, she had already judged Loberia's basic abilities. [[6127 旁白 neutral]]
Even the most powerful ability has its limits. The effect of forced non-aggression must mean that she cannot actively attack herself. This could be judged from the fact that the distance between the two sides was very close in this exchange, and she did not feel the strong repulsion from before. [[6128 旁白 neutral]]
"Vampire Grand Duke, I am your opponent!" [[6129 梅黛亚 angry]]
Medea's Holy Silver Scepter, attacking from behind, was also caught with one hand. Taking advantage of Cayetana's full attention on Loberia, she activated the magic power within her body, drawing on the power of the stars for a second time. [[6130 旁白 neutral]]
[Star Secret Art: Starfall Judgment] [[6131 旁白 neutral]]
Under the ancient runes, a brilliant star cluster barrier dome, like a falling meteor, rapidly descended, dragging a long tail like a comet, directly crashing towards the cherry-red spot on the ground. [[6132 旁白 neutral]]
At the same time, Loberia also actively dispersed the water light enveloping the sword. The sword gleamed brightly, and the hand that Cayetana used to block the Holy Sword's slash immediately sizzled, emitting white smoke. [[6133 旁白 neutral]]
Cayetana winced in pain, and her body froze for a moment. [[6134 旁白 fearful]]
Medea seized the opportunity, continuously chanting to unleash secret arts. [[6135 旁白 neutral]]
[Star Secret Art: Starfall Imprisonment] [[6136 旁白 neutral]]
[Star Secret Art: Waning Star, New Moon] [[6137 旁白 neutral]]
The light of the stars turned into chains, trapping Cayetana's movements. Medea's figure transformed into flickering starlight, instantly disappearing, taking Loberia with her. [[6138 旁白 neutral]]
"Boom!" [[6139 旁白 neutral]]
Another earth-shattering roar, and when the light of the falling meteor extinguished, a huge new crater appeared on the formerly flat ground. [[6140 旁白 neutral]]
The two figures who had disappeared earlier reappeared at the edge of the crater. [[6141 旁白 neutral]]
"Not bad, this Star Secret Art truly has the charm of your ancestor." [[6142 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
The dense smoke from the crater dissipated. Before the situation at the deepest part could be seen clearly, Cayetana's childish yet authoritative voice already reached them. [[6143 旁白 neutral]]
"It's just a pity you're too old. Even at night, with the help of stellar power, you can barely touch the threshold of the fifth tier. In terms of raw strength, you truly can't compare to your ancestor, the red-haired witch of yesteryear." [[6144 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
Still that cherry-colored silhouette, she leaped out of the pit. Her current appearance was somewhat disheveled, her left sleeve empty and stained with blood. The previous attack had blasted away a small portion of her body, but such injuries were negligible for a high-tier vampire. [[6145 旁白 neutral]]
Indeed, from the moment she leaped out of the pit, those hideous wounds began to wriggle, lost flesh regenerated, and broken wounds healed at a visible speed. [[6146 旁白 neutral]]
In less than a dozen seconds, it was completely healed. [[6147 旁白 neutral]]
Loberia frowned. With such terrifying healing ability, and this was before she had even absorbed blood to fully recover her strength, how difficult must it have been for the Wolf King and the Witch to seal such monsters back then? [[6148 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
Time passed by minute by minute. Even though Loberia's mind was usually calm, at this moment, she couldn't help but feel a hint of anxiety. [[6149 洛蓓莉娅 fearful]]
The current situation was that they couldn't inflict effective heavy damage on Cayetana. Cayetana, without absorbing blood, also couldn't do anything to them. Even if she did absorb blood, Loberia still had the trump card of the [Will of No War]. This battle had inevitably been dragged into a protracted war. [[6150 旁白 neutral]]
Normally, Loberia wouldn't mind a long struggle with this Blood Clan Grand Duke, as her own attributes and skill set were more suited for protracted battles. But now, the Wind Saintess had been captured, and no matter what the master and servant's plan was, she had to rush to support as soon as possible. [[6151 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, where every second counted, Loberia made a certain decision. [[6152 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
She could only try the active offense she was least skilled at! [[6153 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
On the other side, Cayetana looked at her completely healed body, with only a lingering wound on her right palm, and her eyes filled with interest. [[6154 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"Little sister, that attack just now really hurt~" [[6155 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"A sword-type weapon that can leave hard-to-heal wounds on a high-tier vampire, if I'm not mistaken, that should be a First-Grade Holy Sword, right?" [[6156 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"A beautiful girl holding a Holy Sword and capable of forcibly stopping a battle~" [[6157 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"I guess you must be the contemporary Water Saintess, right?" [[6158 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
