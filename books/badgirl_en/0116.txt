Chapter 116: The First Progenitor [[6811 旁白 neutral]]
"Sigrid, just answer him like that." [[6812 卡珊德拉 neutral]]
Cassandra suddenly spoke up, offering a suggestion. [[6813 旁白 neutral]]
The Blood Clan girl frowned slightly upon hearing the name, clearly having some bad premonitions, but still did as told. [[6814 旁白 neutral]]
"Sigrid." [[6815 血族少女 neutral]]
The silver-haired girl's voice was crisp like shattered ice, carrying an imperceptible aloofness within her elegance. [[6816 旁白 neutral]]
As soon as these words were spoken, the gentlemanly smile on Vlad's face instantly froze and shattered, finally sinking into complete gloom. [[6817 旁白 surprised]]
"Young lady, are you perhaps making fun of me?" [[6818 弗拉德 angry]]
"Do you truly know what the name Sigrid represents?" [[6819 弗拉德 angry]]
If a normal person's alert threshold is 100%, then Vlad's was now at 200%, specifically for this unfamiliar Blood Clan girl who seemed both familiar and unfamiliar. [[6820 旁白 fearful]]
To the Blood Clan, her very existence and appearance were strange. Born from the clash of two great forbidden curses, this unknown Blood Clan member not only possessed a top-tier appearance, even among her own kind, but her aura also made it impossible for Vlad, a sixth-tier Blood Clan Grand Duke, to discern her true nature. [[6821 旁白 surprised]]
A new Blood Clan member, born from the clash of a fifth-tier Sage and a sixth-tier Blood Clan Duke, not only possessed the magical fluctuations of a fifth-tier peak, but her aura also carried the nobility of Cayetana and the gentle warmth of the mysterious Water Sage. [[6822 旁白 neutral]]
Was she a new form extended after Cayetana possessed her, or was he counter-killed by the mysterious Water Sage and, after being devoured, a new species was born? [[6823 旁白 surprised]]
"..." [[6824 血族少女 neutral]]
The Blood Clan girl remained silent. [[6825 旁白 neutral]]
"Hahahaha..." [[6826 弗拉德 angry]]
Vlad covered his face, immediately laughing out of anger at this unexpected and absurd reaction. [[6827 旁白 angry]]
He had originally thought the other party was trying to intimidate him, but he didn't expect this newly born Blood Clan member didn't even know what the name Sigrid represented, yet dared to speak nonsense here. [[6828 旁白 angry]]
"Young lady, your beauty is indeed captivating, but your foolishness also makes me unable to stop laughing!" [[6829 弗拉德 angry]]
Vlad, who had stopped laughing, his expression completely turned grim. [[6830 旁白 angry]]
"Sigrid is the true name of the great First Progenitor. Do you know what a grave crime you have committed?" [[6831 弗拉德 angry]]
The Blood Clan girl had initially looked at Vlad's continuous changes in expression within a short time with some solemnity, but after hearing the "explanation," the slight solemnity between her brows instantly relaxed. [[6832 旁白 surprised]]
That reaction felt as if her inner thought of, "What did I think it was? So it's just this?" was written on her face, and Vlad was instantly enraged. [[6833 旁白 angry]]
"So that's how it is. Then there's no problem." [[6834 血族少女 neutral]]
She said. [[6835 旁白 neutral]]
"Ignorant child, how dare you usurp the name of the First Progenitor! I, in the name of the descendant of the great God Cain, sentence you to execution now!" [[6836 弗拉德 angry]]
In an instant, only afterimages remained. As a flash of crimson appeared in his vision, Vlad had already moved swiftly in front of the girl, his slender blood-drinking sword drawing a graceful arc in mid-air, its trajectory precisely passing by the girl's fair neck. [[6837 旁白 fearful]]
Everything happened in an instant, with almost no time to react. [[6838 旁白 neutral]]
Medea, who had already been wary of Vlad, raised her blade to block, but the difference in power levels ultimately made her body half a beat slower. Her self-defense was barely enough, and defending others based on her reaction was somewhat beyond her capabilities. [[6839 旁白 sad]]
"Clang!" [[6840 旁白 neutral]]
The sound of metal clashing exploded in their ears, and two figures each retreated a few steps. Vlad stabilized himself faster, and the distance he retreated was clearly shorter, but there wasn't much joy on his face; his already grim eyes became even more gloomy. [[6841 旁白 fearful]]
Although he had already witnessed it before, the actual combat encounter still made him tremble with fear. [[6842 旁白 fearful]]
Even the Steel Bones of the Wolf King, which even sixth-tier Blood Clan members greatly feared, were wielded like an extension of the arm by this unknown, newly born Blood Clan member. [[6843 旁白 surprised]]
"Damn it, what kind of monster did Cayetana fuse?" [[6844 弗拉德 angry]]
Vlad, as one of the strongest undead monsters, cursed for the first time. The scene before him felt as utterly absurd as a licentious succubus believing in the temperate Ice God. [[6845 旁白 surprised]]
But something even more absurd was yet to come... [[6846 旁白 surprised]]
The retreating Blood Clan girl suddenly plunged the classical rapier drawn from the coffin into the altar ground, quickly stabilizing herself with it. [[6847 旁白 neutral]]
The girl stood up from her half-kneeling position, smoothly drew out the rapier, and looked at a smooth gully about ten meters long in front of her. [[6848 旁白 neutral]]
"Indeed, even if you obtained my blood, unable to break through to the sixth tier, you are still inferior to Vlad in a pure power confrontation." [[6849 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
In her mind, Cayetana's voice timely rang out. [[6850 旁白 neutral]]
"However, this aspect is not without a way to compensate..." [[6851 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
She changed her tone, and the final ending carried a hint of teasing and anticipation. [[6852 旁白 neutral]]
"It's time, Sigrid, for your so-called peace, use blood sacrifice on him!" [[6853 卡耶塔娜 neutral]]
"Mmm." [[6854 血族少女 neutral]]
The girl nodded without hesitation, her rapier held upright before her chest, her mind focused, and her skirt fluttering without wind. [[6855 旁白 neutral]]
Even though no one had ever taught her, some abilities were innate, carved into her bones, never to be forgotten. [[6856 旁白 neutral]]
"O Sword~" [[6857 血族少女 neutral]]
The clear, cold chanting broke the silence, and Vlad's body unconsciously stiffened, his blood-red pupils contracting. [[6858 旁白 fearful]]
"Wait! This familiar movement, this same chanting wind-up, she wouldn't be..." [[6859 弗拉德 fearful]]
An incredibly absurd thought exploded in his mind. [[6860 旁白 surprised]]
"Please drink my blood!" [[6861 血族少女 neutral]]
Amidst the girl's blessing, a spot of crimson ignited like a candle flame on the classical rapier's guard, and several blood thorns, like living things, wrapped around the back of the girl's hand gripping the hilt. [[6862 旁白 neutral]]
The thorns pierced her fair skin, greedily drinking the noble Blood Clan's blood, and the rapier's slender blade was coated in crimson. [[6863 旁白 neutral]]
"Clang!" [[6864 旁白 neutral]]
Another brief clash of metal occurred, but this time the struggle was different. Two figures still flew back from the crimson explosion, but this time, the speed and distance of their retreat were almost identical. [[6865 旁白 neutral]]
Vlad, who had previously been able to stand and elegantly stabilize himself, this time knelt on the ground. The white glove on his sword-wielding hand had long been shattered, revealing bones amidst the bloody mess. [[6866 旁白 sad]]
His flesh writhed, and the injury on the back of his hand quickly healed as good as new, but the shock this exchange brought to Vlad was far more profound than the actual injury. [[6867 旁白 surprised]]
"Hey hey hey... Who can tell me what on earth is going on?" [[6868 弗拉德 surprised]]
Vlad, who had long amused himself by playing with trapped prey, felt a deep sense of powerlessness for the first time. He felt his accumulated worldview and experience over these long years crumbling— [[6869 旁白 sad]]
A Blood Clan member who can wield the Wolf King Steel Bones' weapon without being affected, and even successfully perform a blood sacrifice with this "poison"? [[6870 弗拉德 surprised]]
"Cayetana, what the hell did you concoct?!" [[6871 弗拉德 angry]]
"Is this still a Blood Clan member?!" [[6872 弗拉德 surprised]]
