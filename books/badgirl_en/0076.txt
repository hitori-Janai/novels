Chapter 76: What is Sacrifice? [[4289 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Matthew, you..." [[4290 塞纳 neutral]]
"Kind Sister, in your opinion, is sacrifice a praiseworthy act?" [[4291 马修 neutral]]
The messy bard stroked the old harp in his hand and suddenly asked. Sena was stunned by the question and couldn't speak when she met his emerald-green eyes. [[4292 旁白 neutral]]
"Heh..." [[4293 马修 neutral]]
The bard chuckled softly, walked past, his eyes still fixed on the constantly flickering, yet strangely silent entrance at the end. [[4294 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Matthew, although I don't know why you suddenly asked this, in my opinion, those who dare to sacrifice themselves for the sake of more people, and have the courage to take this step, are undoubtedly heroes." [[4295 塞纳 neutral]]
"Heroes?" [[4296 马修 neutral]]
Matthew chewed on these two words, but he couldn't help but chuckle. [[4297 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Matthew, what's so funny about this? Those who selflessly dedicate themselves are heroes. Even the God of Wind will carry their souls on the wind to the sacred Hall of Heroes." [[4298 塞纳 neutral]]
Sena clasped her hands together, her tone sincere and earnest. [[4299 旁白 neutral]]
"Of course, Sister, I don't mean to contradict you. Sacrifice is naturally a noble quality, but a blindly solitary sacrifice only leads to a numb gaze back before the body breaks down..." [[4300 马修 sad]]
"Mr. Matthew, I'm sorry, I, I don't quite understand what you mean..." [[4301 塞纳 neutral]]
Although it was just a messy bard's lament, for some reason, once Sena imagined that scene according to Matthew's words, an uncontrollable sadness arose in her heart. [[4302 旁白 sad]]
"The saddest thing in the world is to let the benevolent Mother Goddess of the world sacrifice herself alone in a bottomless, icy abyss, even a thousand, ten thousand times..." [[4303 马修 sad]]
"For me, the sacrifice of heroes is both glory and an epic worthy of praise. But behind these inspiring stories, on the path drenched with blood and tears, there is an unerasable sorrow." [[4304 马修 sad]]
"..." [[4305 塞纳 neutral]]
Sena looked at this bard, usually messy, but now extraordinary in appearance and temperament, and was speechless for a moment. [[4306 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, her heart had only one thought— [[4307 旁白 neutral]]
Mr. Matthew must be a man with many stories. [[4308 塞纳 neutral]]
"Sorry, I said some strange things. You don't have to mind." [[4309 马修 neutral]]
Matthew turned back with an apologetic smile, his fingers accidentally plucking the strings of the old harp. The sound of the strings rippled, like a gentle breeze blowing across the lake of the heart, causing ripples. [[4310 旁白 neutral]]
"No, Mr. Matthew, your words are very profound..." [[4311 塞纳 neutral]]
Sena crossed her hands over her chest and shook her head desperately. [[4312 旁白 neutral]]
"Your words have made me realize that sacrifice is indeed a noble quality, but we cannot forget that the essence of sacrifice is still a farewell, the moment when the torch that once illuminated the past extinguishes, just because of the praise of epics." [[4313 塞纳 neutral]]
"Exactly! That's why I don't like so many hero legends in picture books. Looking at the children's excited faces as they listen to hero stories, sigh, I just feel so regretful. Children are truly children; they can even eat a knife with such excitement..." [[4314 马修 neutral]]
Matthew sighed regretfully and spread his hands. [[4315 旁白 neutral]]
"But when I usually see Mr. Matthew, whether in the tavern or elsewhere in town, you are almost always telling stories of heroes from various eras. This doesn't match what you're saying. Why is that?" [[4316 塞纳 neutral]]
Sena seemed completely captivated by this topic, almost forgetting that her purpose in stopping Matthew was to make this restless, messy, enticing bard go home obediently tonight. [[4317 旁白 neutral]]
"It's simple. Because I am a bard, and out of respect for heroes, the only thing I can do is sing their stories, just so one more person can remember their names. After all, sacrifice is sad, but forgetting sacrifice is an even greater tragedy of an era..." [[4318 马修 sad]]
"Remembering sacrifice is the only thing we can do for the heroes of the past." [[4319 马修 neutral]]
"No, Mr. Matthew, you are wrong." [[4320 塞纳 angry]]
This time, Sena, who was usually good at keeping silent, refuted him forcefully. The girl clenched her hands, and a persistent light shone in her eyes. [[4321 旁白 neutral]]
"Remembering is not the only thing. Past sacrifices cannot be undone, but we still hold the present and the future in our hands. We must never let the next hero walk down this most helpless path of sacrifice!" [[4322 塞纳 angry]]
"The sacrifice of a hero can indeed become an epic, but it is also a scar of an era. Only living heroes are a victory for all of us." [[4323 塞纳 happy]]
The girl's voice was strong and resonant, like the first ray of dawn that would surely pierce through the dim light. Sensing the restless aura around Sena, Matthew's eyes flashed with momentary surprise, then he chuckled and nodded. [[4324 旁白 neutral]]
"You are teachable indeed. That is true. With the help of companions, aren't the biographies of living heroes more exciting than those of dead heroes?" [[4325 马修 happy]]
"Sacrifice is always sacrifice. Do not praise sacrifice; remember sacrifice. If you must praise, then praise the virtues of heroes." [[4326 马修 neutral]]
The bard's words were profound, carrying the air of a life mentor. [[4327 旁白 neutral]]
"So, Mr. Matthew, it's been delayed for so long, you should go back now. Ensuring the safety of every town resident is my duty as a Sister!" [[4328 塞纳 neutral]]
The atmosphere that had been so carefully created was suddenly broken. Matthew awkwardly touched his nose, but his poetic emerald-green eyes brightened slightly at this moment. [[4329 旁白 neutral]]
He reached out, raising his hand towards the night sky. [[4330 旁白 neutral]]
"Look, the wind is coming!" [[4331 马修 surprised]]
Following the direction of his finger, Sena saw an emerald-green streak of light streaking across the silent night sky. [[4332 旁白 surprised]]
"That is...!" [[4333 塞纳 surprised]]
Although she was just a young Sister from the church, Sena could still clearly feel the powerful magic contained within the emerald-green streak of light. [[4334 旁白 neutral]]
"Mm~ that's right, the free wind will never be absent." [[4335 马修 happy]]
"The soaring Wings of Wind will never be late this time." [[4336 马修 happy]]
The bard's sigh came from beside her. [[4337 旁白 neutral]]
When Sena came back to her senses, she found that Matthew, who had been lingering and refusing to leave, had already gone far, leaving only a blurry figure almost hidden in the darkness. [[4338 旁白 neutral]]
"Mr. Matthew!" [[4339 塞纳 neutral]]
"Alright, I'll go home obediently. I must record this magnificent scene. After all, witnessing an epic unfold with my own eyes is a big deal. I can't wait to compose music for it~" [[4340 马修 happy]]
The bard waved, his voice drifting. [[4341 旁白 neutral]]
... [[4342 旁白 neutral]]
... [[4343 旁白 neutral]]
"Crack!" [[4344 旁白 neutral]]
The dark, hideous head was twisted off directly. Filthy, disgusting blood spurted out like a gush. The priest, turning back, then sent his gun-sword into the mouth of a vampire attempting a sneak attack. The enemy's wails were like the most stirring funeral dirge, adding a touch of cruelty to this bloody battlefield. [[4345 旁白 neutral]]
Andre didn't know how many enemies he had killed by now. [[4346 旁白 neutral]]
Bodies were piled up like hills around him, but most of them were ghouls. Cunning vampires wouldn't foolishly rush forward to die in vain. Except for a few unlucky ones blinded by rage, the others timidly and cautiously chose safer areas to wait for an opportunity. [[4347 旁白 neutral]]
Honestly, he had actually reached his limit long ago. Although using the Precepts bestowed upon his body granted him a significant boost in strength and speed, his body was like an overloaded machine, constantly at risk of breaking down if used for too long. [[4348 旁白 sad]]
Now, every movement he made was accompanied by excruciating pain. If it weren't for the training of the past four years, which had tempered his will like never before, he would probably have fainted from the pain by now, even if he didn't give up. [[4349 旁白 sad]]
Even so, he had reached his limit. If this continued, even if he didn't give up, the divine blood in his body would activate its self-protection mechanism and force an awakening. [[4350 旁白 fearful]]
After crushing another ghoul's head, the priest's sharp sword was plunged into the ground, and his chest heaved, emitting hoarse gasps like an old bellows. [[4351 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, he wouldn't be able to continue... [[4352 安德烈 fearful]]
The scene before his eyes began to blur. [[4353 安德烈 fearful]]
The restless vampires around him immediately became excited, and one of them seized this opportunity to attack from behind. [[4354 旁白 neutral]]
The massive consumption of energy had dulled Andre's originally sharp senses. He couldn't react to this sneak attack from behind. Just as his back was about to be pierced by the vampire's sharp claws, a pale, soul-freezing ice suddenly appeared out of nowhere, blocking Andre's back. [[4355 旁白 surprised]]
At the same time, a hidden snowflake mark on the back of his hand glowed. [[4356 旁白 neutral]]
"Ahhhhh!" [[4357 陌生男1 fearful]]
The attacking vampire let out a shriek like a pig being slaughtered. His hand instantly froze the moment it touched the ice. Due to overexertion and unable to withdraw his strength in time, the residual force shattered his own arm. The remaining cold poison at the severed limb made him wish for death. [[4358 旁白 fearful]]
The surrounding vampires, realizing something was wrong, were just about to surround him when a beam of emerald-green light plummeted down, and the terrifying force of the wind repelled all dozens of black figures. [[4359 旁白 surprised]]
In the dust, a graceful figure stood with an elegant posture. [[4360 旁白 neutral]]
That was...! [[4361 安德烈 surprised]]
