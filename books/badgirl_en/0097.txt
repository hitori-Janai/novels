Chapter 97: Backstab [[5441 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling the gentle breeze caress his skin like water, the opposing sides were reflected in Andre's pupils. [[5442 旁白 neutral]]
He had just concluded that it was a 70/30 split, but that was only in theory. In reality, even a sure victory could be overturned. Who could truly say what destiny held? [[5443 旁白 neutral]]
He twirled the two gun-swords in his hands, watching the potential battlefield intently. If any anomaly occurred, he would be the first to step forward and stop it. [[5444 旁白 neutral]]
Isabella was also standing by, ready. Logically, the preparations were sufficient, but Andre always felt an inexplicable emptiness in his heart, as if he had suddenly forgotten something important... [[5445 旁白 neutral]]
However, at such a crucial moment, he couldn't afford to be distracted. While theory didn't equal reality, true failures were rare. Besides, one of the two coffins had already been sent out, so even if something unexpected happened now, the threat of a Grand Duke vampire with only a soul or only a body would greatly decrease. [[5446 旁白 neutral]]
And this was just the worst outcome... [[5447 旁白 neutral]]
So, three against one, the advantage is mine! [[5448 旁白 happy]]
Wait... where have I heard that before? [[5449 旁白 surprised]]
Such a bold statement suddenly flashed through his mind, and he had a bad feeling that something unpleasant was about to happen. [[5450 旁白 fearful]]
"Oh, Your Highness the Saintess, there's no need for our relationship to be so tense." [[5451 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
"Hmph, humans and demons have been at odds since ancient times. Even in the free Windermere territory, your uninvited presence will certainly not be welcome!" [[5452 塞莱斯特 angry]]
Celeste's aura steadily rose, white feathers scattered, and within the swirling air currents, the faint roar of a dragon could even be heard. [[5453 旁白 neutral]]
"It's Her Highness's [Wind Dragon's Roar]!" [[5454 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
Isabella lowered her voice, almost excitedly whispering into Andre's ear. [[5455 旁白 happy]]
Andre had heard of this name; it was almost the most famous general large-scale destructive magic among all elemental magic. In the war four years ago, Serenia had also used a similar skill, but she used divine magic with even greater power and range. [[5456 旁白 neutral]]
Against a veteran fourth-tier opponent, the power of [Wind Dragon's Roar] was enough to tear every inch of its flesh into shreds. No matter how strong a vampire's self-healing ability was, when its bones and flesh were all pulverized, even the most tenacious life force would be game over. [[5457 旁白 neutral]]
"Ah, no matter what, we'll be family eventually. I thought I'd have to call you Duchess next time we met, and I didn't want to make things so ugly. But since you, my lady, aren't willing to let me finish, then..." [[5458 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
A playful smile tugged at the corners of the Rose Earl's mouth, and he raised a hand to snap his fingers crisply. [[5459 旁白 neutral]]
"Snap~!" [[5460 旁白 neutral]]
"What are you waiting for?" [[5461 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
"Playing tricks!" [[5462 塞莱斯特 angry]]
The frantic wind currents formed the head of a giant dragon. Azure divine light flowed around the maiden's body, and a wind net, forming a cage, sealed off all of the Rose Earl's escape routes. The fourth-tier Rose Earl had no chance of escaping from the fifth-tier Saintess. His only fate was to directly withstand a blow from the Wind Dragon's Roar. [[5463 旁白 neutral]]
All outcomes seemed fated until a string of flowing shadows silently appeared behind the maiden. The familiar aura didn't make her overly suspicious, but the sudden stinging pain blooming from her neck caused her jade white feather pupils to sharply contract. [[5464 旁白 fearful]]
An ambush! When? Why didn't I sense it? [[5465 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
These thoughts flashed through Celeste's mind, but her movements didn't hesitate for a moment because of them. Demonic power once again gathered in her arm, and with a thrust of her waist, she was about to strike a hand blade at the attacker behind her, following the momentum. [[5466 旁白 neutral]]
But when she turned her head and barely caught a glimpse of half of the attacker's face, the hand blade, wrapped in sharp demonic power, suddenly stopped in mid-air. Her body, at that moment, inevitably stiffened. [[5467 旁白 surprised]]
"Seraphina... how is that possible?" [[5468 塞莱斯特 surprised]]
The half-familiar face in her vision belonged to the person closest to her, but those crimson vertical pupils made her mind explode in an instant, turning completely blank. [[5469 旁白 fearful]]
"Your Highness! Seraphina, what are you doing?!" [[5470 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
Isabella's anxious and puzzled voice also came from behind her. [[5471 旁白 neutral]]
"Wh-y?" [[5472 塞莱斯特 sad]]
Celeste could clearly feel her blood continuously flowing from the wound at the arch, but none of that mattered. What mattered was her body, which had completely stiffened and lost control due to a moment of daze during her recent counterattack. [[5473 旁白 sad]]
She struggled to move her lips, her beautiful jade eyes filled with deep sorrow and confusion. [[5474 旁白 sad]]
Seraphina, who had launched the surprise attack from behind her and revealed her vampire form, hugged her even tighter, a hint of ruthlessness flashing in her crimson vertical pupils. [[5475 旁白 neutral]]
I'm sorry, Miss, please forgive my selfishness... [[5476 塞拉菲娜 sad]]
She directed her fangs toward the wound on the maiden's shoulder and neck, releasing a deep black substance. Celeste, held in her arms, suddenly convulsed. Thorn-like spell patterns appeared on her pale skin, and the divine white feather in the center of her jade pupils abruptly vanished. [[5477 旁白 fearful]]
"Clang!" [[5478 旁白 neutral]]
The sword rang clear, and in an instant, a cold gleam circulated. The white-robed priest, lifted by the storm, leaped high into the air, the golden chain pattern on his skin remarkably prominent. His dual gun-swords crossed, slashing out a snowy white blade light in the air. [[5479 旁白 neutral]]
As the blade tip was about to pierce the woman's back, Selen An, flying through the air, felt his heart suddenly throb at a fleeting moment, and the colors of his vision instantly turned gray. [[5480 旁白 fearful]]
Not good! [[5481 塞伦安 fearful]]
The terrifying base stats provided by [Strength-Speed Double A] made his blade swift as lightning. But even at such speed, the moment his heart palpitated, Andre knew it was too late... [[5482 旁白 sad]]
"Ugh, ahhh—!" [[5483 塞莱斯特 sad]]
The maiden in Seraphina's arms suddenly convulsed and looked up, letting out a heart-wrenching scream. Accompanying her voice was the wild wind power in the space, which had suddenly lost all control! [[5484 旁白 fearful]]
Damn it! [[5485 塞伦安 angry]]
He cursed inwardly. While unable to dodge in mid-air, he seized the last momentary gap to turn his head and shout at Isabella behind him. [[5486 旁白 neutral]]
"Quick, get out of the way!" [[5487 塞伦安 fearful]]
After speaking, the man felt as if his entire body had been struck by a giant's heavy hammer. His figure shot backward like a cannonball, embedding itself deep into the stone wall. [[5488 旁白 neutral]]
"Andre!" [[5489 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
Leaning on her gun, Isabella, whose face was still pale, anxiously called out. But from the smoking crater in the wall, besides a few drops of blood trickling down the stone, there was no sound in response. [[5490 旁白 sad]]
As the thorn-like spell patterns almost covered the maiden's entire body, Celeste, who had been holding on, finally went limp and completely collapsed into Seraphina's arms. [[5491 旁白 sad]]
The divine domain suddenly collapsed. Without the wind's restraint, the Rose Earl elegantly stepped over the death line of the crack that had just appeared in front of him and approached the two women. He looked down at the green-haired maiden who had fainted in the nun's arms. After clearly seeing the thorn-like spell patterns on her cheeks, the smile on the Rose Earl's face became even more unrestrained. [[5492 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh~ what a charming sight~ With such a beautiful bride, the Duke will surely be pleased~" [[5493 蔷薇伯爵 happy]]
... [[5494 旁白 neutral]]
"Why?" [[5495 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
Isabella raised her dirt-stained face, her golden-brown eyes brimming with tears, a mix of sorrow and anger. She bit her lower lip tightly, raised her gun, and asked tragically. [[5496 旁白 sad]]
"Why did you betray Miss? Why did you betray us?" [[5497 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
Seraphina, as if cloaked in shadows, held the maiden in her arms in a princess carry. She turned and met Isabella's gaze with crimson vertical pupils that Isabella found utterly unfamiliar. [[5498 旁白 neutral]]
"Isabella, I'll give you a chance. Come join us." [[5499 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
