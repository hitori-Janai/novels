Chapter 7, Reset 7: When Strength Falls Short, Acting Fills the Gap [[351 旁白 neutral]]
As the blade rested on his neck, he felt for the first time that death was so close. [[352 旁白 fearful]]
"For the sake of the Winterlein name, I will allow you to leave some last words." [[353 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Her ethereal yet sharp words echoed in his ears. The young woman's cold voice seemed to have no warmth, and just hearing it sent a chill through his soul. [[354 旁白 neutral]]
The young man's mind went blank as he struggled to move his eyes. He could clearly feel a sharp, icy sword against his neck. [[355 旁白 fearful]]
If the sword moved even a little, it would easily cut his main artery, and he would die right here. [[356 旁白 fearful]]
Damn! [[357 塞伦安 angry]]
The reinforcements he had waited for so anxiously turned out to be a beautiful psycho who wanted to chop off his head without a word. [[358 旁白 angry]]
Dealing with her feels even more dangerous than dealing with Mara, the succubus, doesn't it?! [[359 旁白 fearful]]
"Wait, Serenia, can you just listen to my explanation first? I was tricked! That traitor Mara set me up!" [[360 塞伦安 fearful]]
Right now, Selen An had no desire to admire his 2D waifu, even though she was so close. [[361 旁白 neutral]]
Come on, is a beautiful woman more important than his own life? [[362 旁白 neutral]]
What he needed to do now was to shake Serenia's determination to carry out the divine oracle. Then, using his knowledge of the plot, he had to guide her step by step to avoid the worst possible outcome for both of them. [[363 旁白 neutral]]
But this was very difficult, even the first step. After all, this was another world, not his modern, materialistic society. Believing in gods was common here, and Serenia was no ordinary believer. [[364 旁白 neutral]]
The duty of a Saintess was to convey and execute divine oracles. Entrusted with such a heavy responsibility, there was no doubt about Serenia's devotion to her faith and her god. [[365 旁白 neutral]]
Getting her to defy a divine oracle was almost impossible, but his identity offered a small chance for an exception. [[366 旁白 neutral]]
After all, according to the plot, although Selen An was a jerk, he was one of only two people close to the Saintess Serenia. [[367 旁白 neutral]]
Although that closeness had long since faded with their childhood, left behind in the past. [[368 旁白 sad]]
But nothing mattered more than his own life. He was already at a gambling table he couldn't leave, and no matter how small the chance of winning, he had to bet! [[369 旁白 fearful]]
If he won, he might still have a chance to be a noble stud. If he lost, it was either off with his head, or he would be forced into endless piston-pumping in a dark demon den... [[370 旁白 fearful]]
The young man's desperate attempt to explain himself made the girl's sword pause for a moment. [[371 旁白 neutral]]
Noticing this slight change, Selen An felt a surge of joy. [[372 旁白 happy]]
It seemed the original owner still held a significant place in Serenia's heart. At least his words could affect her. There was a chance! [[373 旁白 happy]]
The girl with ice-white hair frowned slightly. Her gaze toward the young man was a mixture of disgust and pity. When he called out her name, a faint sadness appeared in her beautiful, ice-blue eyes. [[374 旁白 sad]]
But this sadness quickly faded, and the grip on her ice sword became firmer. [[375 旁白 neutral]]
"Selen An, you know that begging me now is useless. The divine oracle has been issued, and there is no room for you to be saved." [[376 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Even the gods cannot tolerate the evil deeds you have committed, and this time you have made a terrible mistake..." [[377 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"No one can save you. I know you fear death, so I will try to make it as gentle as possible." [[378 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"If you still consider yourself a member of the Winterlein family, please stop your cowardly begging. Don't... bring any more shame to the family name." [[379 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
The girl's words were like ice spears, piercing the young man's heart, making his breath grow weak and his blood run cold. [[380 旁白 fearful]]
A gentle death... [[381 塞伦安 fearful]]
I'm just saying, I want to live. Is it possible not to die? [[382 塞伦安 fearful]]
Of course, he couldn't say that out loud. He still needed to rely on his childhood friend to get him out of this mess. The most urgent thing now was... [[383 旁白 neutral]]
Gritting his teeth, the young man ignored the sharp blade at his neck, reached out his grubby hand, and tightly gripped the wrist of the girl's free hand. [[384 旁白 surprised]]
A look of shock filled the girl's ice-blue eyes. Since awakening her bloodline and becoming the Saintess, her pure body had never been touched by a man. [[385 旁白 surprised]]
"You!..." [[386 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
Because of her bloodline, her body was always colder than a normal person's. Most people who got close to her couldn't stand the bone-chilling cold, so they kept their distance. [[387 旁白 neutral]]
Growing up, the only peers she could be close to were her own younger sister and the man in front of her. [[388 旁白 neutral]]
One was because they shared the same bloodline. The other was also because of bloodline; as a direct descendant of the Winterlein family, he was her only male friend outside of her family during childhood. [[389 旁白 neutral]]
And now, her wrist was held tightly in his palm. Perhaps from the recent exertion, the young man's body was very warm, and the contact between his palm and her delicate skin even felt a little hot. [[390 旁白 neutral]]
She instinctively wanted to struggle, but she was afraid of hurting his weak, ordinary body, so she didn't dare use force. Just like that, her hand was pulled over and pressed against Selen An's lower abdomen, over his clothes. [[391 旁白 neutral]]
When Serenia saw where her hand was, a rare, faint blush appeared on her face. She was both shocked and angry. Just as she was about to pull her hand back forcefully, she heard his sincere-sounding voice. [[392 旁白 surprised]]
"You can feel it, can't you? The unclean thing inside my body." [[393 塞伦安 neutral]]
Selen An's tone suddenly became calm, so calm that he didn't seem like the debauched and ignorant person Serenia remembered. [[394 旁白 surprised]]
The girl was startled. She carefully felt the young man's lower abdomen through his clothes, and a look of shock flashed in her eyes. [[395 旁白 surprised]]
"A Succubus Seed! Those demons actually planted something like this inside you!" [[396 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
Clearly, her regular "dealings" with the Demon Clan allowed her to recognize the time bomb inside Selen An. [[397 旁白 neutral]]
"Serenia, I don't deny anything you said before. As you can see, I am indeed a jerk." [[398 塞伦安 sad]]
First step in getting into character: to slowly gain the other person's trust, you must show sincerity. What sincerity means is different for everyone. But for a classic spoiled villain like Selen An, what could be more sincere than a weak, arrogant, and fake young master admitting his own faults? [[399 旁白 neutral]]
The young man wore a bitter, self-mocking smile. He looked steadily at the girl, his eyes free of greed, pleading, or stubbornness. His sky-blue eyes were as calm as still water, pure and peaceful. [[400 旁白 sad]]
"I won't run anymore. What I've been through on this journey has made me understand that some things are impossible to escape..." [[401 塞伦安 sad]]
"I have committed countless sins, and many people have suffered or lost their families because of me. If those people or the gods want to kill me, I deserve it. But before I accept my judgment, I have just one small request..." [[402 塞伦安 sad]]
"Serenia, as the last descendant of the direct Winterlein line, maybe my past actions don't deserve this name. But when I die, I want to at least die as a human..." [[403 塞伦安 sad]]
"In these last moments of my life, can you grant me this one small request?" [[404 塞伦安 sad]]
Second step, after showing sincerity, persuade with emotion and reason. For a girl like Serenia, who seems stubborn and rigid on the outside but is actually warm-hearted, you have to play the emotion card and be reasonable. [[405 旁白 neutral]]
Emotionally, Selen An had a natural advantage. After all, the "childhood friend" label wasn't for nothing. Childhood feelings are the purest and most unforgettable, and playing this card was sure to have an effect. [[406 旁白 neutral]]
The hardest part was reasoning. If it came to grand principles, a typical spoiled villain like Selen An deserved to be sentenced to death by a thousand cuts. [[407 旁白 neutral]]
But that was the original owner! Not him! [[408 旁白 angry]]
He just happened to die suddenly while playing a game and crossed into this body. It would be a huge injustice to be executed as a villain! [[409 旁白 fearful]]
But the reality was that the word "transmigration" probably didn't even exist on the Nephalem continent. If he said he had transmigrated and wasn't Selen An, people would just think he was crazy. [[410 旁白 neutral]]
But as the saying goes, there are always more solutions than problems. It was unrealistic to try to completely clear his name through reasoning, so he had to push things in a direction that favored him. [[411 旁白 neutral]]
Since it was unreasonable for him not to be killed, he had to delay and buy as much time as possible within reasonable limits. [[412 旁白 neutral]]
How could he delay things reasonably? [[413 旁白 neutral]]
He had to use his status, just like the emperor in a TV show who said, "An emperor has an emperor's way to die; how can a sword be used on him?" [[414 旁白 neutral]]
He was now a top noble and a descendant of a Saintess. In this world where a Saintess was equal to a king, his status wasn't much different from an emperor's. Since an emperor couldn't be killed with a sword, it was reasonable for him to want to die as a human, right? [[415 旁白 neutral]]
