Chapter 119: Fate Cannot Be Defied [[6985 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, the air seemed to freeze, and even the movement of the wind appeared to stop. [[6986 旁白 neutral]]
Any symbols related to the future and prophecy would inevitably remind people of various legends about doomsday predictions and prophet divinations. [[6987 旁白 neutral]]
From a certain perspective, people both desire prophecies and instinctively fear them. [[6988 旁白 neutral]]
The future is unknown and has endless possibilities, but the appearance of a future seems to nail down the countless choices before one's life to a single path. Whether this path leads to good or bad, you cannot choose; you can only quietly await the judgment called prophecy. [[6989 旁白 neutral]]
At least so far, in stories about prophecies, apart from those so-called founding monarchs and heroes, most protagonists do not have good endings. [[6990 旁白 neutral]]
For this reason, prophecies have become a curse in the eyes of many ordinary people. It seems that once their future is foretold, they will fall into an endless abyss. Because of this feeling, the witch race, who possess prophetic abilities, are naturally rejected and even expelled by ordinary people. [[6991 旁白 neutral]]
Witches, once a great race of prophets, became cursed sorceresses in people's mouths. This is part of the reason for the gradual weakening and decline of the witch race. [[6992 旁白 sad]]
Although the lineage of the Wind Saintess has always been known for its open-mindedness and freedom, no one can guarantee that they can truly accept a prophecy from the legendary "cursed" race without any reservations. [[6993 旁白 neutral]]
"Continue." [[6994 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
The long silence in the office was broken. The girl slowly spoke, her soft voice showing no emotional changes. [[6995 旁白 neutral]]
Seeing the girl's insistence, Seraphina no longer hid anything and slowly began to speak. [[6996 旁白 neutral]]
"In that dream, I saw your figure, Miss, and also dozens of other sisters." [[6997 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
As a Holy Nun personally appointed by the Wind Saintess, the "sisters" Seraphina spoke of as equals were naturally the other Holy Nuns. [[6998 旁白 neutral]]
The selection of Holy Nuns was already extremely strict. Even including those left by the previous Wind Saintess, Celeste only had about a dozen Holy Nuns under her command. [[6999 旁白 neutral]]
The Saintess and dozens of Holy Nuns appearing together almost activated the entire core of the Wind Saintess lineage. What kind of event would require such a large force? [[7000 旁白 surprised]]
"I saw countless blood-red eyes surrounding us in the vast darkness. Under the pale moonlight, accompanied by the clashing sounds of hooves, the blood-red gazes gathered like a creeping black tide..." [[7001 塞拉菲娜 fearful]]
As Seraphina recounted, the room, which usually had good airflow, now felt somewhat stuffy. Breathing became unconsciously rapid and difficult, and her chest felt as if a stone had been placed on it. [[7002 旁白 fearful]]
The prophecy continued... [[7003 旁白 neutral]]
"In the dream, we were surrounded by countless demons. It was as if we were in a very remote wilderness, uninhabited. We kept breaking through on horseback. Along the way, the sisters stayed behind to cover our retreat, but in the end..." [[7004 塞拉菲娜 fearful]]
Her voice dropped so low on the last word that it was almost inaudible, but Celeste actively took over. [[7005 旁白 neutral]]
"It failed, didn't it?" [[7006 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 sad]]
"Yes." [[7007 塞拉菲娜 sad]]
Seraphina didn't dare to look up and observe the girl's expression because her voice was calm, but facing a prophecy that could be called a curse, she felt that no one could maintain absolute calmness. [[7008 旁白 neutral]]
"The result of the failed breakthrough is either that I and my sisters die in battle together, or we are captured." [[7009 塞拉菲娜 sad]]
"..." [[7010 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Seraphina did not speak. In this situation, silence meant agreement. [[7011 旁白 neutral]]
"It seems my fate isn't exactly good." [[7012 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 sad]]
Standing up from the chair, the green-haired girl walked to the window, placing her delicate hand on the windowsill. Her emerald eyes gazed out at the ancient city radiating from the Wind God Cathedral. [[7013 旁白 neutral]]
"Seraphina, do you think the future in a prophecy can be changed?" [[7014 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
After a long time, she turned around again, looking calmly at the dark-haired girl standing silently behind her. [[7015 旁白 neutral]]
"I don't know, Miss." [[7016 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"According to you, a witch has three chances for prophecy in her lifetime. Before this prophecy, have you had any previous prophetic experiences?" [[7017 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
"Yes." [[7018 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"What did you foresee in your first prophecy?" [[7019 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 neutral]]
"I foresaw that one day in the future, on a bright and sunny morning, I would meet a green-haired girl as beautiful as a fairy. I originally didn't believe such beauty existed in this world and thought it was just a dream, but later, reality proved to me that the prophecy was not false, because..." [[7020 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
"On that day, I met you, Miss." [[7021 塞拉菲娜 happy]]
Only the sound of breathing remained in the air. For Seraphina, it was definitely a beautiful memory, but for Celeste, this story further proved the accuracy of prophecies. [[7022 旁白 neutral]]
The Saintess's whereabouts were kept absolutely secret. Besides a few close confidantes, even high-ranking members of the Wind Church might not be able to confirm her real-time location. What's more, at that time, Seraphina was just an unnoticed orphan in an orphanage. [[7023 旁白 neutral]]
Moreover, she was the Wind Saintess, who would never be deceived. [[7024 旁白 neutral]]
At once, the five characters "Fate Cannot Be Defied" seemed to be carved into her heart. [[7025 旁白 sad]]
"Sometimes, I truly wish I wasn't the Wind Saintess. That way... I could still use this parable as a small joke of yours to deceive and numb myself." [[7026 瑟蕾妮娅•格莱西斯 sad]]
The wind blew in through the window, messing up the hair ties Seraphina had braided for the girl and disturbing the girl's calm state of mind. [[7027 旁白 neutral]]
"Miss, this is how fate is. Countless stories tell us that no matter how hard one struggles to break free from the shackles of destiny, in the end, one only circles within the boundaries set by fate, becoming a puppet for fate to manipulate at will when exhausted." [[7028 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Behind her was Seraphina's whisper. The originally clear sky suddenly darkened, shadows proliferated in the room, the sun fell from the sky, and a blood moon rose from below the horizon, completely dominating the sky. [[7029 旁白 fearful]]
Wind blew again, but it brought no coolness or dryness. Instead, it was damp and bloody, shrouded in shadows within the room. Sticky, wet sounds emerged, as if someone's shoe sole had stepped into blood-soaked ground. [[7030 旁白 fearful]]
Suddenly, she felt an embrace from behind, but this embrace was not warm. Instead, it carried a biting coldness, constantly drawing warmth from her body. Her fingertips gradually turned icy. Celeste, realizing the abnormality, seemed to have completely fallen into an unknown dilemma within the dream. Her emerald eyes slowly dimmed, as if despairing at the end of life. [[7031 旁白 fearful]]
"Miss, this is your fate..." [[7032 玛拉 neutral]]
A chin rested on her shoulder, golden hair tickling her fair neck, yet bringing a bone-chilling wind. [[7033 旁白 fearful]]
"Fate reveals that you will surely fall into the hands of demons. Even if you try every means to avoid and escape, fate will still tightly entangle you..." [[7034 玛拉 neutral]]
"Besides, you can't escape... The thorn curse on you can only be lifted by the power of the Bloodline. The path ahead is already clear. Since your life, whether you choose to resist or escape, will inevitably fall into the hands of demons, why bother to struggle against fate?" [[7035 玛拉 neutral]]
"Since fate is so unfair to you, why should you dedicate your short life to this already unjust world?" [[7036 玛拉 neutral]]
The person embracing her from behind, accompanied by the demonic whispers, gradually melted into sticky, dark red liquid, which seemed to completely envelop the girl. [[7037 旁白 fearful]]
Her lusterless emerald eyes were about to be completely swallowed by the scarlet fluid, but at this moment, a short, sharp object piercing a body interrupted this process. [[7038 旁白 surprised]]
All the wriggling fluid suddenly stiffened as if electrocuted, and behind it, an emerald holy sword, wreathed in wind, shone brightly. [[7039 旁白 surprised]]
