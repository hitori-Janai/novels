Chapter 51: How to Make High-Grade Holy Water [[2936 旁白 neutral]]
The bathroom was filled with thick water vapor. The soft light from the magic stone in the corner outlined the blurry curves of the girl in the mist. [[2937 旁白 neutral]]
Even though in her Water Saintess form, her holy body naturally had a purifying effect, bathing wasn't only for when one's body was dirty. Once she became a girl, this body naturally had a longing to soak in warm water. [[2938 旁白 neutral]]
In the small bathtub, the girl's long hair spread out, and her tiny body was completely submerged in the warm water. She reached out, popping the bubbles floating on the water's surface, her sky-blue eyes observing every detail through the hazy mist. [[2939 旁白 neutral]]
"I really want to stay here forever and never come out." [[2940 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The girl murmured softly, but she knew it wasn't realistic. Besides providing a moment of bathing enjoyment, this tub of bathwater was also being collected and sealed. After all, this whole tub of water... was high-grade holy water strictly controlled by The Church! [[2941 旁白 neutral]]
Thinking of this, her cheeks couldn't help but blush. [[2942 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, she couldn't afford the luxury of bathing in high-grade holy water. With her current identity, neither Father Andre nor Sister Evelyn had the right to request such a large amount of high-grade holy water all at once. [[2943 旁白 neutral]]
High-grade holy water was an extremely rare and precious item, both in the game and in reality. Unlike the production of ordinary holy water, which only required adding an appropriate amount of sun flowers, stardust powder, and other materials to pre-prepared pure water, then having a clergyman recite specific blessing spells for purification, filtering, and storage, its creation was much more complex. [[2944 旁白 neutral]]
The method for making high-grade holy water had always been a mystery. The Church, which held this secret, had never revealed it for thousands of years. Without any surprises, he, as an ordinary priest, would never know this secret in his lifetime, but... [[2945 旁白 neutral]]
But who knew she had another identity besides being a priest? [[2946 旁白 surprised]]
It was a coincidence. When the old man was still alive, one Sunday, she had just come out of the bathroom after bathing and had just changed into clean clothes. She saw the old man wildly collecting... bah! [[2947 旁白 surprised]]
He was holding a storage container, continuously collecting the bathwater left after her bath. [[2948 旁白 neutral]]
At first, she thought she had discovered some unknown special habits of the old man. After changing back to Selen An, she was about to go and catch him in the act, but the old man subdued her with a backhand and gave her a "love education." [[2949 旁白 neutral]]
Afterward, he learned from the old man that one of the methods for making high-grade holy water was to collect pure water that had been in intimate contact with a Saintess's bare skin for a certain period of time. [[2950 旁白 neutral]]
And the bathwater from a Saintess's bath just happened to meet these conditions. [[2951 旁白 neutral]]
Therefore, most of the high-grade holy water, which was hard to come by for many great nobles and even the royal family in the empire, was almost all bathwater left over from Saintesses' baths! [[2952 旁白 surprised]]
No wonder The Church had always kept the method of making high-grade holy water strictly secret. The extremely rare and precious high-grade holy water turned out to be the bathwater of Saintesses! This news, once spread, would definitely cause a sensation! [[2953 旁白 fearful]]
Leaving aside the reactions of those great nobles and the royal family who regarded high-grade holy water as a treasure, even among the common people, it would have a considerable impact. Once they knew that a Saintess was a walking gold mine, some ill-intentioned merchants or troublesome people might take risks and commit crimes against the wind. [[2954 旁白 fearful]]
Although Saintesses are usually protected by a personally appointed Holy Knight order, and furthermore, the Saintesses themselves are among the strongest on the Nefarem Continent, what if something unexpected happens? [[2955 旁白 fearful]]
If adult Saintesses couldn't be dealt with, what if those people turned their attention to underage Saintess heirs who hadn't yet awakened their bloodline? [[2956 旁白 fearful]]
Don't be lucky enough to think that those people would be deterred by the power of the Saintess families or The Church. After all, a certain great sage in the previous life once said in his writings: [[2957 旁白 neutral]]
"With proper profit, capital becomes very bold. With 10% profit, it will be used everywhere; with 20%, it becomes lively; with 50%, it causes active adventure; with 100%, it makes people disregard all laws; with 300%, it makes people not fear crime, and even not fear the danger of hanging." [[2958 旁白 neutral]]
Kidnapping Saintess heirs and exploiting them as an inexhaustible high-grade holy water production machine—how could the profit from such a business be only 300%? [[2959 旁白 neutral]]
Human greed is infinite, and Loberia understood this well. [[2960 旁白 neutral]]
So, looking at this pool of high-grade holy water, Loberia still had to collect it. After the old priest returned from reporting his work in Roland City, she would hand over a portion of it to him to handle. [[2961 旁白 neutral]]
Anyway, for her, high-grade holy water was completely inexhaustible. Kempfa was located in a remote area, and she rarely encountered major disasters on weekdays. Ordinary holy water could fulfill almost all needs in her daily work. [[2962 旁白 neutral]]
If it weren't for Andre recently trying to make high-grade talismans, frequently failing and consuming a lot of high-grade holy water, her own stock wouldn't need to be replenished at all. [[2963 旁白 neutral]]
Sure enough, was her magic talent still too poor in her normal form? [[2964 旁白 neutral]]
After bathing, she changed into a clean nun's habit. Looking at her reflection in the water mirror, against the solemn black and white nun's habit, the girl in the mirror was perfectly like the holy nun blessed by the gods in all believers' imaginations. [[2965 旁白 neutral]]
If Sister Isabella showed the fullness and cunning of a bad woman, then Sister Yifulin, when she put on this "uniform," gave the feeling of a pure angel who could purify the soul. [[2966 旁白 neutral]]
And this wasn't even her complete form! [[2967 旁白 surprised]]
Yes, you heard right. In Windermere Territory, nuns just wearing a nun's robe and a nun's veil didn't fully meet the standard. According to local regulations, nuns in churches that worship the God of Wind must wear white long stockings or white pantyhose on their lower bodies. [[2968 旁白 neutral]]
This was not the will of the God of Wind, but the command of the Wind Saintess. [[2969 旁白 neutral]]
One can only say that the original was indeed an 18+ eroge; various settings in the worldview also contained erotic elements! [[2970 旁白 neutral]]
And that Wind Saintess, whom she had never met, was simply a complete white-stockings fetishist! [[2971 旁白 surprised]]
Although in her Water Saintess form, Loberia's original outfit also included white stockings, even white stockings with side ties that were more complex than ordinary designs... [[2972 旁白 neutral]]
But none of this was important. Anyway, she, the Water Saintess, wasn't the only Saintess with an extremely erotic costume design. The original Saintess robes of other Saintesses weren't necessarily much more conservative than hers. Almost all Saintess character designs constantly swung between holiness and eroticism. [[2973 旁白 neutral]]
One can only say, is this the power of 18+? [[2974 旁白 neutral]]
"Forget it, don't waste time overthinking." [[2975 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Loberia pulled out the armchair and sat down at the desk. Taking advantage of the quiet night, with six or seven hours until dawn, she prepared some things for tomorrow's work in advance, for example... [[2976 旁白 neutral]]
Uncle John's right foot, which was disabled a few years ago due to an accidental fall from a height, should be able to recover completely this time with a slight increase in healing power. [[2977 旁白 neutral]]
Healing disabled limbs was effortless for Loberia, but to avoid causing too much sensation and attracting attention from The Church, she always carefully controlled the healing efficiency for some severe injuries on the town residents, ensuring that there would be no exaggerated phenomenon of complete healing in an instant. [[2978 旁白 neutral]]
After all, showing too outrageous a talent would inevitably attract some unnecessary trouble. [[2979 旁白 neutral]]
To avoid exposing her identity, Loberia was overly cautious. [[2980 旁白 neutral]]
And John's eldest son, Aunt William, Grandpa Charles... [[2981 旁白 neutral]]
Under the night sky, the light in the priest's room remained on. The blue-haired girl sat quietly at the desk, making meticulous preparations again and again for the acquaintances she would meet tomorrow, until the sky slightly brightened... [[2982 旁白 neutral]]
