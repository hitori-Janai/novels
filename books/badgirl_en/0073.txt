Chapter 73 Super Strength [[4131 旁白 neutral]]
Andre held a handful of magic talismans. [[4132 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, he was trying his best to regulate his breathing, aiming to get his body into the best possible state. [[4133 旁白 neutral]]
Thanks to the almost endless supply of high-grade holy water from his other identity, even he, a foolish priest with little magic talent, had managed to create and accumulate many magic talismans by investing a great deal of time and resources. [[4134 旁白 neutral]]
In the Nephalem Continent, as long as a person's physical body and soul strength are sufficient, theoretically, an infinite number of buff layers can be stacked; this reality perfectly replicates the game. [[4135 旁白 neutral]]
So, if he were to stack the effects of this entire handful of magic talismans on himself, how terrifying a "superman" would he become in the end? [[4136 旁白 neutral]]
Andre had never tried it, but he had seen similar scenarios in his previous life. However, a mortal body could not compare to an undead body after all; overly powerful blessings could even tear flesh. [[4137 旁白 fearful]]
But there was no time to worry about such things anymore; the fire suppression tactic had already failed. The Holy White Flame couldn't hold back the ghoul attack for much longer, and a small, bat-skirted vampire was still circling in the sky. [[4138 旁白 fearful]]
At such a time, even a slight misstep in judgment would lead him and the town behind him into eternal damnation. [[4139 旁白 fearful]]
Since he had already made his choice, he would certainly face it with resolve. [[4140 旁白 neutral]]
"Come on." [[4141 安德烈 neutral]]
The man's voice was a bit hoarse. He slowly opened his palm, filled with magic talismans. All the magic power in his body was released, and a bright blue light rose from his skin, lifting each silver talisman into the air like flowing water. [[4142 旁白 neutral]]
The different magic runes inscribed on each talisman lit up one by one. As the fragmented silver light peeled away, the white-robed priest's body became covered with countless layers of colorful magic particles. [[4143 旁白 neutral]]
[Silence] Talisman, activate! [[4144 旁白 neutral]]
[Wind Control] Talisman, activate! [[4145 旁白 neutral]]
[Protection] Talisman, activate! [[4146 旁白 neutral]]
[Luck] Talisman, activate! [[4147 旁白 neutral]]
[Life] Talisman, activate! [[4148 旁白 neutral]]
[Invigorate] Talisman, activate! [[4149 旁白 neutral]]
... [[4150 旁白 neutral]]
... [[4151 旁白 neutral]]
With each additional layer of magic talisman blessing on his body, the tearing pain he felt on his skin intensified. The power of the talismans came at a cost, but by bearing that full cost, the pain would surely elevate him into an all-powerful superman! [[4152 旁白 neutral]]
Twelve layers of blessed light tore open lava-like red cracks on Andre's skin. Capillaries burst continuously, then rapidly regenerated under the effect of the [Life] Talisman. [[4153 旁白 fearful]]
The moment the first ghoul burst through the fire wall, he stomped the ground and shot forward. His fist, enveloped in colorful light, pierced directly through the monster's chest! [[4154 旁白 neutral]]
Rotten flesh and broken bones exploded in a circle. Andre seized the moment, grabbed a spine, and swung it in a wide arc. His arm, imbued with the [Evil Breaking] Talisman, moved like a flail, smashing five ghouls in half at the waist. Their intestines hung burning on the holy flame, and foul-smelling, scorched grease dripped down like fiery rain. [[4155 旁白 neutral]]
Under the watchful eyes of the vampire bats in the sky, the ghouls charged forward one after another. However, these attacks by groups of three to five had no effect on Andre. His figure was like a vibrant, radiating sun; every punch and kick created a series of crackling air explosions. [[4156 旁白 neutral]]
Two years of study, two years of training—all the combat techniques taught by the old man flashed through Andre's mind like a slideshow at this moment. His body endured tearing pain, yet he moved as light as a gust of wind. [[4157 旁白 neutral]]
Without relying on the penetration of firearms or the sharpness of blades, solely with his fists and feet, every ghoul that came close was beaten to death by his lightning-fast, lethal moves. [[4158 旁白 neutral]]
At this moment, he had transformed from a benevolent priest into a high-speed killing machine. As he moved, he inevitably stirred up a storm of blood. [[4159 旁白 neutral]]
However, the numerical disadvantage slowly became apparent over time. The bat swarm in the sky seemed to realize that this priest was no ordinary foe; they began to control the ghouls to circle around and attack from all directions, forming a complete encirclement. [[4160 旁白 neutral]]
No matter how strong a person is, they only have two eyes. The blind spot behind them is a fatal weakness. Dealing with attacks from the front while guarding against sneak attacks from behind was almost impossible. [[4161 旁白 fearful]]
Soon, a ghoul seized an opportunity, its sharp claws tearing through the priest's white overcoat. Blood sprayed with the shredded fabric. Perhaps seeing the prey's blood, the ghouls, who had been somewhat hesitant, became even more frenzied after smelling the gore. [[4162 旁白 fearful]]
Andre's wounds were rapidly increasing. Although the [Life] Talisman aided healing, the body's recovery speed clearly couldn't keep up with the rate at which new injuries appeared. [[4163 旁白 fearful]]
If this continued, he would eventually be exhausted to death! [[4164 旁白 fearful]]
As more and more ghouls successfully landed blows, these instinct-driven monsters rushed forward in a massive swarm, almost submerging Andre's figure. [[4165 旁白 fearful]]
The colorful light bursting from his body was obscured by ghoul after ghoul. Soon, this human-shaped sun, blooming in the night, would be extinguished in the darkness, snuffed out by the monsters' sharp claws. [[4166 旁白 fearful]]
The bats circling in the sky let out excited cries. They seemed to be mocking the ignorance and recklessness of the priest on the ground, believing that anyone who dared to oppose the Blood Clan would end up with no bones left. [[4167 旁白 happy]]
"Clang!" [[4168 旁白 neutral]]
The next moment, with a clear clang of a blade, a bone-chilling cold swept through everyone's hearts. Pale sword light slashed out, incomparably powerful, swiftly tearing through the ghouls' encirclement. [[4169 旁白 surprised]]
Shredded flesh and severed limbs flew everywhere, blood and brains splattered. His emerald eyes filled with killing intent, and the bone-chilling sound of the blade striking created sparks of slaughter. [[4170 旁白 neutral]]
Andre leaped out from the swarm of corpses; wherever he moved, bodies continuously fell. His white overcoat was completely torn, revealing his heavily scarred and blood-soaked upper body. [[4171 旁白 neutral]]
The monsters tried to bury him in an impenetrable darkness, but they didn't know that in front of the Gunblade Priest, who was an agent of divine punishment, their existence was nothing more than a mass of decaying, moving rotten flesh! [[4172 旁白 angry]]
"Whoosh!" [[4173 旁白 neutral]]
A beam of silver light shot out, and a splash of blood erupted within the bat swarm that had been calmly observing the battle in the sky. The flying silver light was the gunblade Andre had thrown, its sharp blade piercing through one of the bats. [[4174 旁白 neutral]]
The bat swarm scattered with cries of terror and anger. [[4175 旁白 fearful]]
From the very beginning, they had been superior overseers, only needing to control their cheap "hounds" to continuously besiege and exhaust their humble prey. [[4176 旁白 neutral]]
But the priest on the ground was clearly not a prey they could easily control. With his gunblade, he shattered their sense of superiority, vowing to declare war on the arrogant Blood Clan! [[4177 旁白 neutral]]
An exasperated Blood Clan member appeared in human form, their scarlet eyes filled with cruelty and rage. [[4178 旁白 angry]]
"You foolish human livestock, how dare you declare war on the noble Blood Clan!" [[4179 陌生男1 angry]]
Andre seized the opportunity to throw another bottle of Holy White Flame, temporarily blocking the ghouls' attack once more. [[4180 旁白 neutral]]
He thrust the gunblade into the ground beside his feet, wiped the blood from his face with his hand, and revealed a mocking smile. [[4181 旁白 neutral]]
"You're nothing but a bunch of cowardly rotten flesh and bones, yet you shamelessly call yourselves the Blood Clan. You rats, who only dare to hide in dark ditches, still dream of being the fisherman who reaps the final profit?" [[4182 安德烈 angry]]
Andre's words undoubtedly added fuel to the vampires' already raging anger. In addition to the five who had previously descended, another four vampires came down from the sky, revealing their human forms and glaring angrily. [[4183 旁白 neutral]]
There were nine enemies in total, and Andre was alone. [[4184 旁白 neutral]]
He spat out the blood in his mouth, and a hint of fatigue appeared in his emerald eyes. [[4185 旁白 neutral]]
In such a high-intensity battle, if he hadn't possessed abnormal endurance and recovery attributes far beyond ordinary people, he would have likely been overwhelmed by the previous tide of corpses. [[4186 旁白 neutral]]
However, compared to the inconsistent quality of ghouls, vampires could be considered elite monsters. Dealing with nine elite monsters at once, even Ultraman would struggle without changing forms. [[4187 旁白 neutral]]
So... [[4188 旁白 neutral]]
The restriction preventing the bats from using sound-based abilities was lifted. Golden divine ripples once again appeared in the man's eyes. This time, the target of his power was not the enemy, but himself! [[4189 旁白 neutral]]
As the illusory golden chain patterns attached to his skin, he became bound as if nailed to a cross. His magical aura rapidly faded, while at the same time, two other attributes completely unrelated to the priestly profession rapidly increased. [[4190 旁白 neutral]]
If one were to open his status panel at this moment, they would be astonished to discover that the man's strength and speed attributes had quietly transformed to A-rank. [[4191 旁白 surprised]]
