Chapter 107: The Enraged Water [[6330 旁白 neutral]]
    On the dark night sky, at the edge of the altar, Vlad stared with interest at the battlefield below, which was covered by a starlight barrier. [[6331 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hmm~ such fiery red hair. I can even feel the surging vitality on him from such a distance!" [[6332 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "That witch's blood must be delicious, at least it is now." [[6333 弗拉德 neutral]]
    He was like the only God in this world, commenting casually on the life-and-death battlefield of others like a gourmet. [[6334 旁白 neutral]]
    Avril stood quietly by his side, like a loyal maid, always waiting for her master's command and orders. [[6335 旁白 neutral]]
    "Wait, why isn't that Sage moving anymore?" [[6336 弗拉德 surprised]]
    He was watching the good show when he suddenly noticed something was wrong with the azure figure on the battlefield standing still. He stroked his chin, and a joyful light shimmered in his scarlet eyes. [[6337 旁白 surprised]]
    "Ah, a fight between two people is so boring. A battle between three people is more interesting. Let me see what trouble you've gotten into~" [[6338 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Vlad's words were not meant to kindly solve problems for others. He was simply bored overlooking this prelude to life and death, outside of it all, and just wanted to find some fun. [[6339 旁白 neutral]]
    A powerful thought was cast into his blood-red pupils. Just as Vlad was about to ignore the distance and forcefully pour a part of his spirit into that azure figure, the previously motionless girl suddenly made a gesture of cutting her palm and abruptly looked up. [[6340 旁白 neutral]]
    In an instant, as if the Goddess of Fate had intentionally plucked the threads of destiny, the gazes of one person and one ghost collided from a super long distance. Vlad only felt his mind sink, and his soul seemed to be immersed in a special viscous deep sea at that moment. [[6341 旁白 fearful]]
    "Ugh!" [[6342 弗拉德 fearful]]
    His body trembled uncontrollably, and he groaned. His blood-red vertical pupils were covered by circles of water ripples in a short time. The misty water seemed to permeate his soul, pulling his consciousness into a world constructed of water and light... [[6343 旁白 fearful]]
    "Here is... an illusion?" [[6344 弗拉德 surprised]]
    His consciousness was pulled into an illusion constructed of pure water. Vlad looked around, his voice filled with strong disbelief. [[6345 旁白 surprised]]
    "I actually fell for an illusion?" [[6346 弗拉德 surprised]]
    "And an illusion from a Fifth-tier Mage?!" [[6347 弗拉德 angry]]
    He, a dignified Sixth-tier Blood Clan Grand Duke, even in the Demon Realm, was among the top existences. One day, one day he was actually tricked by a Fifth-tier? [[6348 弗拉德 angry]]
    No, that's not right, it's a coincidence. [[6349 弗拉德 neutral]]
    The moment he cast out his spirit, he happened to make eye contact with that azure-haired girl. His spirit leaving his body would naturally be weaker than normal, and the powerful illusion launched by that Fifth-tier Sage at this opportune moment could pull his consciousness into the illusion world. [[6350 旁白 neutral]]
    Of course, this is theoretically possible, but it's difficult to achieve in actual combat. But he is facing this situation now; otherwise, it cannot be explained at all. [[6351 旁白 neutral]]
    Otherwise, if it were said that a Fifth-tier pulled a Sixth-tier into an illusion world, who would believe it? [[6352 旁白 neutral]]
    The more an illusion can completely control a person's consciousness, the longer it takes to prepare and accumulate power, and the more restrictions there are. Most illusions used on the battlefield are instant illusions, and the effects are mostly dizziness and disorientation within five seconds. Such an instant, super-large illusion is unheard of even for him, a Sixth-tier. [[6353 旁白 neutral]]
    Vlad simply didn't believe that a Fifth-tier Sage alone could develop such an illusion magic. [[6354 旁白 neutral]]
    But disbelief aside, this momentary hit made him pay more attention to that mysterious blue-haired Sage. [[6355 旁白 neutral]]
    There are very few people who can make her "flip over," and this one is a special case among special cases. If necessary, she must be eliminated or taken for his own. [[6356 旁白 neutral]]
    Outside, for the girl, pulling a Blood Clan Grand Duke into an illusion world through eye contact was only a matter of an instant. Ripples shone in her azure water-drop eyes, and powerful mental power directly sent the blood-colored soul that wanted to fish in troubled waters into the Divine Water Illusion. [[6357 旁白 neutral]]
    As for what happens next, she doesn't care... [[6358 旁白 neutral]]
    The sword in her hand had changed. After drinking her own blood, the broad, blunt blade seemed to have been polished countless times in an instant, and the water swirling around the sword was no longer peaceful, but surged like a mighty river about to rage. [[6359 旁白 neutral]]
    The benevolent Mother of Peace was a thing of the past. What was now present was the Ruler of the Oceans, the Supreme Lord of All Waters, the Water Saintess attacking in a world-ending form! [[6360 旁白 neutral]]
    On the other side, from the initial apprehension and vigilance, to understanding the enemy's fighting habits, and now to steady suppression, Medea's close-combat suppression ability was very good. But a witch is a witch after all; her main job is to hide behind the team and act as a magic cannon, and she is no match for a Blood Clan Duke, who is like a magic assassin, in close combat. [[6361 旁白 neutral]]
    The destructive power of weapons made from the steel bones of the Wolf King indeed made the Blood Clan wary without exception, but as long as one could completely dodge the weapon's attacks, even the highest stats would be useless. [[6362 旁白 neutral]]
    This was the situation at hand. As the battle continued, the blood crystal prism blades swirling around Cayetana increased exponentially. The dense attacks and sneak attacks from various blind spots were impossible to guard against. After less than ten minutes of fierce fighting, Medea was wounded in many places. If it weren't for the Starlight Secret Art enhancing her physical condition to its peak, she, old and frail, would have already been defeated... [[6363 旁白 fearful]]
    But the situation wasn't looking much better now. As expected, the enemies the ancestors fought were so strong that they didn't seem to be from the same plane. Without the descendant of the Wolf King, even with the Wolf King steel bone weapon, it was still difficult to fully utilize its power. [[6364 旁白 fearful]]
    If this continued, she would... [[6365 旁白 fearful]]
    As this thought flashed through her mind, she felt a strong shockwave pass through her body. Before her brain could react, her body was lifted by a force, and her vision rapidly blurred. Then she found herself, at some unknown point, lying on the back of an elk completely constructed of water elements. Everything around them was blurring and rapidly being left behind... [[6366 旁白 surprised]]
    What, what happened? [[6367 梅黛亚 surprised]]
    The Fifth-tier Medea was still a bit confused, while the Sixth-tier Cayetana, standing in place, had her expression completely frozen. [[6368 旁白 surprised]]
    She looked up at the suddenly bright daylight. It wasn't water light; it directly enveloped the barrier constructed by starlight, a raging tide covering the sky and earth! [[6369 旁白 surprised]]
    "Hey, a starting forbidden spell? Is this seriously a Fifth-tier?" [[6370 卡耶塔娜 surprised]]
    Looking at the sky-obscuring Forbidden Spell Matrix, countless magic circles overlapped, covered, and rotated. Unlike Overlord-tier and below magic, which simply used basic applications of magic spells and laws, this huge one... was a supreme magic level created by using laws as a foundation, connecting the world and heaven. This was a milestone in magic history, and also the most brilliant achievement that magicians, honored as Sages, could create—a Forbidden Spell. [[6371 旁白 neutral]]
    And on top of that world-ending tide, the sword-wielding girl plunged her sword downwards without reservation. [[6372 旁白 neutral]]
    [Forbidden Spell • Water Element • Tear Crown Elegy of the Divine Water Princess] [[6373 旁白 neutral]]
    ps: For those who are reading my Magical Girl book, don't worry too much recently. It might be because someone reported it, and the title, synopsis, and cover were detected as "inappropriate" by the system. I'm working hard to resolve it these days, don't worry, I haven't run away... [[6374 旁白 neutral]]
