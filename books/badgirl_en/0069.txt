Chapter 69: Princess [[3909 旁白 neutral]]
    "The, the Demon King?" [[3910 旁白 surprised]]
    The maid's mouth was half-open in shock. [[3911 旁白 surprised]]
    "Hmm, is there a problem?" [[3912 莎缇拉 neutral]]
    Satella crossed her arms, her face showing no unusual expression. [[3913 旁白 neutral]]
    "But, Lady Satella, even if it's a dead seed, it was born from your body after all. Is it really okay to just give it away like this?" [[3914 旁白 fearful]]
    "She insisted." [[3915 莎缇拉 neutral]]
    "She asked, and you gave it to her?" [[3916 旁白 surprised]]
    The maid still couldn't quite understand her Queen's thought process. [[3917 旁白 neutral]]
    Even if it was a dead seed, as long as it was planted in someone else's body, it could still turn them into a succubus. It just wouldn't inherit the Queen's powerful bloodline. [[3918 旁白 neutral]]
    No matter what, it was conceived within her. Giving this seed away was like giving away half of her child. The Queen had always cherished her two daughters, and even gave up her favorite male consort. Why would she suddenly be so ruthless about this? [[3919 旁白 sad]]
    "Don't play dumb with us here. Others might not know, but you do, right? Our Demon King was our best friend before she took the throne. We were practically inseparable. But ever since she became Queen..." [[3920 旁白 sad]]
    At this point, the charming Queen couldn't help but narrow her eyes. [[3921 旁白 sad]]
    "She's like a different person, so cold and distant that I feel like a stranger..." [[3922 旁白 sad]]
    Perhaps that position holds an immense temptation for every demon, or perhaps power can completely change a demon. The Demon King before and after her ascension was like two different people. Her authority also grew day by day, making even Satella, her best friend, dare not be presumptuous in front of her. [[3923 旁白 fearful]]
    It was as if the Demon King had completely forgotten their past friendship. [[3924 旁白 sad]]
    This is why Satella, as one of the most powerful sixth-tier arch-demons in the Demon Realm, rarely participated in major decisions. [[3925 旁白 neutral]]
    As the person closest to the Demon King, after the Demon King's ascension, she was also the most feared existence. After all, she knew too many of the Demon King's secrets. If she didn't act smart and obediently surrender, perhaps the entire succubus tribe would have to find a new leader. [[3926 旁白 fearful]]
    Since this matter involved the Demon King, the maid also obediently shut her mouth and dared not ask any more questions. [[3927 旁白 neutral]]
    The room fell into a strange silence. After a long while, the Succubus Queen sighed and brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. [[3928 旁白 neutral]]
    "I don't know the whereabouts of that Succubus Seed afterwards, but since I can sense it now, it means the seed has been reactivated. More importantly..." [[3929 莎缇拉 happy]]
    Her voice revealed undisguised excitement. [[3930 旁白 happy]]
    "The person who was planted with the seed successfully inherited my bloodline from that dead seed!" [[3931 莎缇拉 happy]]
    "Past matters I don't want to manage, nor can I. She is, after all, the King of the entire Demon Realm. We must obey her orders. However, since the seed has successfully sprouted and successfully continued my bloodline, this is my family affair, and I must take care of it~" [[3932 莎缇拉 happy]]
    With these words, Satella no longer concealed her aura. The terrifying aura of a sixth-tier arch-demon quietly released, and the succubus maid beside her immediately showed an extremely serious expression. [[3933 旁白 fearful]]
    She had served the Queen for many years, and the Queen revealing this stance meant that even with the Demon King's interference, she would not back down an inch on this matter. [[3934 旁白 neutral]]
    As the Queen of Lust, she never abandoned her duties as a mother. [[3935 旁白 neutral]]
    "Lady Satella, please feel free to command! Regarding the little princess, your subordinate will do her utmost!" [[3936 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hmm, I trust you with this matter. After all, you have served me for a hundred years and personally raised my two daughters. You are very familiar with the aura of royal blood." [[3937 莎缇拉 neutral]]
    "So this time, I want you to go to human territory, find the little princess's whereabouts there, and bring her back. Later, I will mark a general area on the map, and you can search based on that." [[3938 莎缇拉 neutral]]
    At this point, Satella couldn't help but caress her lower abdomen, a motherly excited smile appearing on her face. [[3939 旁白 happy]]
    As the last and only Succubus Seed conceived after her ascension to the sixth-tier, the child born from that seed held extraordinary significance to her. [[3940 旁白 neutral]]
    As long as Mila finds her in the Empire and brings her back, she will personally educate her to become a qualified succubus princess. [[3941 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[3942 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[3943 旁白 neutral]]
    "So, it seems the danger hasn't passed yet?" [[3944 旁白 fearful]]
    Isabella's expression remained uneasy after hearing the information Andrew obtained from the interrogation. [[3945 旁白 fearful]]
    "These guys are really that daring?" [[3946 旁白 surprised]]
    "Nothing the demons do surprises me, but from the current situation, the town's safety still isn't guaranteed." [[3947 旁白 neutral]]
    Andrew, who had mostly recovered in about a day, sat in a high-backed chair, playing with a demon-hunting bullet in his hand. [[3948 旁白 neutral]]
    "A small squad of vampires, plus a considerable number of ghouls. This combat power is enough for a siege, and they're doing this in the heart of the Empire? Are they crazy?" [[3949 旁白 angry]]
    Isabella slammed her fist on the table, and her ample white fruits couldn't help but jiggle from the force. [[3950 旁白 neutral]]
    "Five days. Three full days have passed from when those three vampires disguised as a caravan entered the town until last night. Today is the fourth day, and if nothing unexpected happens, tomorrow..." [[3951 旁白 fearful]]
    "Damn it, time is so tight! They're not giving us any chance or time to call for reinforcements!" [[3952 旁白 angry]]
    "No matter what their goal is, our duty is only to protect this town. For that, any price is worth it." [[3953 旁白 neutral]]
    Andrew placed the silver demon-hunting bullet upright on the table, his voice calm. [[3954 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella looked at him in surprise, her slender brows unconsciously furrowing. [[3955 旁白 surprised]]
    "Hey! You don't mean..." [[3956 旁白 surprised]]
    "We can't defend the entire town by ourselves. Reinforcements must be called. As for time, I'll buy it." [[3957 旁白 neutral]]
    The man's voice remained faint, with little emotional fluctuation. [[3958 旁白 neutral]]
    "You're crazy? Just three vampires and a small group of ghouls already injured you! No matter how good your physique is, you're still just a mortal! Mortals can't kill those monsters alone!" [[3959 旁白 angry]]
    Isabella practically leaped out of her chair in a frenzy. [[3960 旁白 angry]]
    "That's not necessarily true, Isabella..." [[3961 旁白 neutral]]
    The man raised his eyes and smiled lightly. The smile seemed casual, but the determination in his eyes was undeniable. [[3962 旁白 neutral]]
    "Everyone has their secrets. How do you know I'm a mortal and not a monster?" [[3963 旁白 neutral]]
    "I admit your strength is good, and your character is impeccable, but this is no time for jokes. A large number of demons absolutely cannot be handled by a single person! I..." [[3964 旁白 angry]]
    "Isabella." [[3965 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andrew interrupted the gray-haired nun's vehement speech. He raised his hand, and the snow-white, sharp gun-sword slid out from his sleeve again. The mirror-smooth blade reflected half of the priest's stern face. [[3966 旁白 neutral]]
    "Even after two years of being together, you still don't want to trust me." [[3967 安德烈 sad]]
    "No, I'm not..." [[3968 伊莎贝拉 sad]]
    "Actually, your identity is also quite unusual, am I right, Isabella?" [[3969 安德烈 neutral]]
    "..." [[3970 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
    "So please trust your companion, Isabella. Perhaps the me you know isn't the complete me." [[3971 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Go get reinforcements; I'll kill the enemies." [[3972 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Clang!" [[3973 旁白 neutral]]
    The strangely shaped, long gun-sword was forcefully plunged into the wooden tabletop. Andrew stood up from the high-backed chair. [[3974 旁白 neutral]]
    "It's settled then." [[3975 安德烈 neutral]]
    He turned and walked towards the outside of the church. [[3976 旁白 neutral]]
    "Where are you going?" [[3977 伊莎贝拉 surprised]]
    Isabella, who had come back to her senses, asked. [[3978 旁白 neutral]]
    "To Mike's tavern for a drink." [[3979 安德烈 happy]]
    "Priests are not allowed to drink!" [[3980 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
    "That's different. We believe in the God of Wind. The God of Wind allows his followers to have a good drunk before a fierce battle." [[3981 安德烈 happy]]
    "Even if the God of Wind doesn't care, it will still deduct good deeds and add sins!" [[3982 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
    "It's fine, I'm already deep in debt, so a little more won't hurt." [[3983 安德烈 neutral]]
    The priest waved his hand and walked into the sunlight with an unyielding posture, disappearing in front of the church door. [[3984 旁白 neutral]]
    PS: Damn it, Bai E is so handsome, why didn't you say so earlier? What am I, a non-chief who pulled 2+1 Xiadie and 1+1 Feng Jin, supposed to do... I'm numb... [[3985 旁白 sad]]
