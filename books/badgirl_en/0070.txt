Chapter 70: Generosity [[3987 旁白 neutral]]
    "Yo, Father Andre, why are you here today?" [[3988 陌生男1 neutral]]
    Matthew, sitting on an empty wine barrel by the tavern door, was the first to notice Andre's arrival. With his greeting, the few scattered people inside the tavern instantly turned their gazes towards them. [[3989 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre glanced at the bard Matthew, whose clothes were still old and messy, and couldn't help but laugh. [[3990 旁白 neutral]]
    "Almost every time I see you, you're sitting on an empty wine barrel. Is it that you've been sitting for so long your butt has stuck to the barrel lid and sprouted roots?" [[3991 安德烈 happy]]
    His words immediately made the people in the tavern burst into laughter. Matthew knew the priest was joking with him, and being thick-skinned, he didn't even blush at being exposed. Instead, he proudly patted the empty wine barrel under his backside. [[3992 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hey, what can I say? The chairs in the tavern must be left for the guests. An insignificant bard like me can just sit on an empty wine barrel. Besides, after sitting for a long time, I even think an empty wine barrel is more comfortable than a chair~" [[3993 陌生男1 happy]]
    These words again drew continuous laughter from the customers. As the tavern owner, Uncle Mike had already gone out to greet him. [[3994 旁白 neutral]]
    "Father, it's rare to see you. It's been a very long time since you last visited my tavern." [[3995 迈克 surprised]]
    "What, Mike, have I not patronized your tavern for so long that you no longer welcome me as a guest?" [[3996 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Of course not! It is my honor to host you." [[3997 迈克 happy]]
    Uncle Mike quickly waved his hand, his eyes filled with admiration and respect. [[3998 旁白 neutral]]
    In the entire town, he admired only three people: the old priest of the church, Sister Evelyn, and Father Andre, who was right in front of him. [[3999 旁白 neutral]]
    Father Andre was not only knowledgeable but also very approachable, often helping town residents solve various problems. In this regard, he was much better than his adoptive father, Old Father Ango. [[4000 旁白 neutral]]
    It's not that the old priest was a bad person, but his temper was rather peculiar. Most town residents respected his seniority, so their feelings towards him were more fear than admiration. [[4001 旁白 neutral]]
    But the gentle Father Andre solved this perfectly. When interacting with him, there was no sense of distance that ordinary people felt when talking to clergy, which was truly precious. [[4002 旁白 neutral]]
    After all, even in a church built under the protection of the Wind God, the gap between clergy and common people was still hard to bridge. Priests who could truly befriend the common people were very few. [[4003 旁白 neutral]]
    As Mike pushed a beautifully packaged bottle of wine towards Andre and personally pulled out the cork with a crisp "pop," a rich and mellow aroma instantly filled the air. [[4004 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hey, Mike, that's not fair! Last time I came to your tavern, I saw this bottle of wine already. You put it in the most prominent spot on the bar. I wanted to buy it then, but you insisted it wasn't for sale. So now you see Father here and you eagerly bring it out?" [[4005 陌生男1 angry]]
    A customer joked, stirring up trouble. [[4006 旁白 neutral]]
    "Go on, go on! Don't you look in the mirror? This wine cost me a fortune to get from Roland City. Usually, only nobles are worthy of drinking it. In our small town, only Father Andre deserves this bottle of wine!" [[4007 迈克 happy]]
    Mike raised his head as if uncorking the bottle for Father Andre was a great honor. [[4008 旁白 neutral]]
    Everyone burst into laughter again. Although Mike's words were direct, no one felt offended or unhappy in their hearts. After all, Father Andre was a universally respected person in the entire town; the residents truly admired him. [[4009 旁白 happy]]
    Moreover, such a fine bottle of wine was by no means something ordinary people could afford. For Father Andre, it was just right. [[4010 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre looked at the beautifully packaged red wine in his hand, scanned the surroundings, and then asked Mike. [[4011 旁白 neutral]]
    "How much is this bottle of wine? If it's expensive, I can't afford it." [[4012 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Oh, Father, you're being too polite! You usually preside over confession rituals for us, interpret the Wind God's teachings, and even provide help in our daily lives. For all of this, you've never asked for even a single copper coin in return." [[4013 迈克 happy]]
    "Now that you've come to my tavern, how can I ask you for money for the wine?" [[4014 迈克 neutral]]
    Mike still held the cork in his hand, his words extremely sincere. [[4015 旁白 neutral]]
    As soon as he spoke, it immediately resonated with everyone inside and outside the tavern. People praised the Father's virtues. [[4016 旁白 happy]]
    "Yes, Father Andre should drink this wine!" [[4017 陌生男1 happy]]
    "Mike, I'll pay for this wine! Consider it my gratitude for Father Andre's selfless help over the years!" [[4018 陌生男1 happy]]
    "Count me in too! I'll contribute a share of the wine money!" [[4019 陌生男1 happy]]
    "Me too, me too!" [[4020 陌生男1 happy]]
    The atmosphere in the tavern instantly became lively. But Mike wasn't going to indulge these drunkards. He finally had a chance to show off in front of Father Andre today; how could he let these guys steal his thunder? [[4021 旁白 neutral]]
    "Go on, go on... all of you, wash your faces and look in the mirror! Usually, each of you bargains for half a day over the cheapest glass of wine. Today, seeing Father here, you all straighten your backs and pretend to be rich?" [[4022 迈克 angry]]
    "Who doesn't know you only have a few broken copper coins in your pockets? If you really paid for this wine, who knows how many drunkards would be loitering outside my door tomorrow, drooling with desire." [[4023 迈克 angry]]
    Mike forcefully pushed through the crowd and walked towards the bar. [[4024 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre, however, opportunely reached out and patted his shoulder. [[4025 旁白 neutral]]
    "I feel everyone's enthusiasm and gratitude. We can set aside the money for now. But it would be too boring for me to drink this bottle of wine alone. Besides, it's already against the rules for a priest to drink, and heavy drinking would be too much." [[4026 安德烈 neutral]]
    "So, how about this? Let's share this bottle of wine together. Although it's good wine, it's only truly good wine when everyone tastes it together~" [[4027 安德烈 happy]]
    Andre raised the uncorked bottle of red wine in his hand and suggested. [[4028 旁白 neutral]]
    Everyone looked at each other, and then burst into enthusiastic agreement. Who in the tavern wouldn't want to taste good wine, especially such high-quality wine that only nobles were usually privileged to drink? [[4029 旁白 happy]]
    Andre raised the red wine bottle and walked through the aisle, tilting the bottle mouth again and again towards the raised glasses of the crowd. The deep red wine, combined with its mellow aroma, instantly ignited the emotions of the entire venue. [[4030 旁白 happy]]
    Matthew sat on the wine barrel, a full glass of red wine in his hand. He looked at the enthusiastic, red-faced crowd, then lowered his head and took a sip of red wine. [[4031 旁白 neutral]]
    "Not bad at all~" [[4032 马修 happy]]
    Then he looked up at the white-robed priest, surrounded and admired by the crowd, a meaningful smile flashing in his bright eyes. [[4033 旁白 neutral]]
    "This kindness, it's truly generous~" [[4034 马修 neutral]]
    "So, generous Father, can you truly guide the lost wind in the right direction, like flowing, tolerant water, just like..." [[4035 马修 neutral]]
    "Him, back then?" [[4036 马修 neutral]]
    This was a bard's murmur, unnoticed amidst the lively atmosphere of the tavern. [[4037 旁白 neutral]]
