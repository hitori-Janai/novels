Chapter 77: The Holy Nun [[4362 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre leaned against the ice wall that appeared out of nowhere. His bloody right hand, gripping the gun-sword, trembled slightly. Each breath he took was accompanied by a burning pain like fire, and the gradually dimming golden chains on his body indicated that the strength of this body was about to run out... [[4363 旁白 fearful]]
    At that very moment, even he himself thought that this was his limit as a priest. He originally thought things had progressed to the scene he least wanted to see, but he didn't expect... there was still a master. [[4364 旁白 surprised]]
    Amidst the smoke and dust, the wind flowed until that graceful figure emerged from behind the hazy curtain. Only then did Andre clearly see the familiar figure that was not entirely unexpected—Isabella. [[4365 旁白 neutral]]
    "Quite a mess, Father." [[4366 玛拉 neutral]]
    She stood in the pit created by the wind swirl during her fall, tossing her flowing gray hair. Her golden-brown eyes held cunning and teasing. [[4367 玛拉 neutral]]
    "Cough, cough, is this what you meant by 'returning tonight'?" [[4368 旁白 angry]]
    The man coughed up two mouthfuls of dirty blood, looking at the gray-haired nun wrapped in wind, slightly out of breath. [[4369 旁白 neutral]]
    Her appearance hadn't changed much. Although she was still wearing a nun's habit, there were slight differences in the details. The hem of her habit's skirt and sleeves had cyan wind god patterns that ordinary nun's habits did not. [[4370 旁白 neutral]]
    And the most striking thing was undoubtedly the pair of wings behind Isabella, made of pure wind elements. Isabella was able to descend from the sky relying on these wings. [[4371 旁白 neutral]]
    Is it Wind Wing, a high-level magic in wind element magic? [[4372 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre secretly guessed in his heart. [[4373 旁白 neutral]]
    At the priest's reminder, Isabella looked up again at the slightly tilted full moon in the sky, and an apologetic curve appeared at the corner of her mouth. [[4374 玛拉 neutral]]
    "Sorry, I encountered a small accident on the way, but..." [[4375 玛拉 neutral]]
    "Isn't it still not dawn? Before dawn, it's all considered on-time support." [[4376 玛拉 neutral]]
    "..." [[4377 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre leaned against the ice wall, not even having the strength to roll his eyes. [[4378 旁白 sad]]
    So, three or four in the morning also counts as "tonight"? [[4379 旁白 angry]]
    A little later, it would be dawn! [[4380 旁白 angry]]
    If he had to hold out alone until then, even the vampires would be forced to retreat. What would be the point of support then? [[4381 旁白 sad]]
    Well, in a way, Isabella didn't break her promise, though he hadn't really been counting on her anyway. [[4382 旁白 neutral]]
    "Hey, you two, are you treating us like air?!" [[4383 陌生男1 angry]]
    The blood race members who had been blown away by Isabella's cyclone earlier crawled back, covered in dust and dirt. They watched the man and woman chatting casually, even joking, as if nothing had happened. Suddenly, a feeling of being ignored surged into their brains, turning into anger. [[4384 旁白 angry]]
    They had used countless hounds and several companions, and the powerful, ghost-like priest was almost defeated. But then, a nun using wind magic suddenly descended from the sky. They were about to capture their prey, but suddenly felt it snatched away, which made the blood race clench their teeth. [[4385 旁白 angry]]
    "Damn female slave, when I catch you later, I'll make you taste what it's like to be sucked dry while fully conscious!" [[4386 陌生男1 angry]]
    This was the usual pre-battle tough talk from the blood race, but what they got in return was Isabella's scornful glance. That look enraged the blood race, and it made them inexplicably think of a dissatisfied wife facing an incompetent husband. [[4387 旁白 angry]]
    Most of the team were male vampires. Faced with this situation, how could they tolerate it? [[4388 旁白 angry]]
    "Charge together!" [[4389 陌生男1 angry]]
    Dozens of dark figures simultaneously rushed towards Isabella, but to the gray-haired nun, these moves, which usually caused Andre great trouble, were full of flaws. [[4390 旁白 neutral]]
    Her aqua-blue wind element wings behind her twisted in a spiral motion with her body, and the gentle wind at this moment became extremely violent, the howling deafening. [[4391 旁白 neutral]]
    [Wind Magic: Rapid Whirlwind Disk] [[4392 旁白 neutral]]
    The dark figures in mid-air couldn't brake in time and, without exception, crashed into the spiraling wind wall. Thus, the previous scene was replayed: the advancing vampires once again fell into the pit with a splat, like mosquitoes swatted by a fly swatter. [[4393 旁白 neutral]]
    Taking advantage of this opportunity, Isabella controlled the wind to lift her body and came to Andre's side. She first reached out and grabbed his bloody arm. Upon skin contact, a gentle wind rose again, and a soft cyan light attached itself to the wound, immediately reducing the pain. Only the comfortable sensation of cool wind blowing remained at the wound. [[4394 旁白 neutral]]
    Andre felt as if his body, which had been like a parched field about to crack, had received a life-saving sweet dew. His lost stamina was slowly recovering with time. [[4395 旁白 happy]]
    "Is it Azure Mist Revival from wind magic?" [[4396 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre casually asked, looking at his healing wound. [[4397 安德烈 neutral]]
    "Heh, it seems Father is not only proficient in combat, but also very knowledgeable about magic~" [[4398 玛拉 neutral]]
    Isabella, who was casting healing magic, took a moment to habitually tease him. [[4399 玛拉 neutral]]
    "Among healing magic, water, light, and wind are the most compatible elements. And I remember that the wind magic, Azure Mist Revival, is a rare magic recorded in the Cathedral of the Wind God. Ordinary nuns don't have the chance to learn it..." [[4400 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre avoided her joke with a straight face, his gaze subtly fixed on the extra cyan-blue divine patterns on Isabella's nun's habit. [[4401 安德烈 neutral]]
    "It seems my previous guess was not wrong. Miss Isabella, your identity is indeed quite extraordinary. But I can't understand why one of the dignified Twelve Holy Nuns would be willing to hide her identity and stay in a small place like Kempfer?" [[4402 安德烈 neutral]]
    Unlike other Saintesses who bestowed titles upon Holy Knights, the lineage of the Wind Saintess seemed to have a typical "lesbian complex." Without exception, all the knights they enfeoffed were knightesses. Moreover, this peculiar preference seemed to have a tendency to be passed down through the bloodline to the next generation. Every generation of Wind Saintesses was like this, and over time, it became a tradition. [[4403 旁白 neutral]]
    The real change occurred when a certain generation of Wind Saintesses took office. She completely abolished the Holy Knight system in the territories under her jurisdiction and bestowed a new title upon her personal guards: Holy Nun. [[4404 旁白 neutral]]
    Therefore, in essence, the Holy Nuns beside the Wind Saintess are equivalent to the Holy Knights enfeoffed by other Saintesses, except that Holy Nuns are, without exception, all female. [[4405 旁白 neutral]]
    Under the healing of [Azure Mist Revival], Andre's superficial wounds were almost completely healed, and he spoke with more vigor. [[4406 旁白 neutral]]
    Magic recorded in the Cathedral of the Wind God must have its unique aspects, and Andre proved this with his personal experience. [[4407 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, Father, please don't use such a questioning tone~ After all, I'm not the only one hiding my identity~" [[4408 玛拉 neutral]]
    The gray-haired girl raised her slender eyebrows and pursed her cherry lips towards the back of the man's hand. [[4409 玛拉 neutral]]
    "Am I right, Chief Holy Knight of the Ice Saintess?" [[4410 玛拉 neutral]]
    "I don't understand what you're saying." [[4411 安德烈 neutral]]
    Andre frowned. The pattern on the back of his hand seemed to have been left by Serenia during the great war four years ago. At first, he only thought this mark was for temporary protection and surveillance, and as that battle ended, the mark indeed disappeared. [[4412 旁白 neutral]]
    Until just now, when his body as a priest was about to suffer unavoidable severe damage, the mark that had disappeared for four years suddenly reappeared, and a strange power surged within him. The ice wall that appeared out of nowhere also came from this. [[4413 旁白 neutral]]
    Listening to Isabella, this mark seems to be... [[4414 旁白 neutral]]
    "Ah, yes, yes, yes... Even now, Andre, you're still unwilling to admit it, so I, a humble woman, will just continue to play along with your act~" [[4415 玛拉 neutral]]
    Isabella, having finished the treatment, spread her hands, looking entirely unconvinced. [[4416 玛拉 neutral]]
    Please, the Chief Holy Knight is the Saintess's most important personal guard and confidant. It can be said that the Chief Holy Knight is one of the few people most closely related to successive Saintesses. Historically, there have even been real cases of Saintesses falling in love with their Chief Holy Knights. [[4417 旁白 neutral]]
    How could there be someone in this world who is the Chief Holy Knight but doesn't know they are the Chief Holy Knight? [[4418 旁白 sad]]
    She even thought of abducting this lecherous but reliable man for her mistress before. Now it seems she was overthinking; a talent like this would have already been booked by other Saintesses in advance! [[4419 旁白 sad]]
