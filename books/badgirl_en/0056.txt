Chapter 56: The Saintess and the Merfolk [[3183 旁白 neutral]]
"Mother..." [[3184 温蒂尼 sad]]
Undine looked at the golden-haired figure still kneeling under the shade of the Holy Tree, her voice tinged with a hint of sorrow. [[3185 旁白 sad]]
Ever since the Holy Tree flew from the Elf Forest to take root in the Craigmore Plains for no reason, her mother had led their people all the way here. She thought this whole affair would end, but it turned into a long, drawn-out battle. [[3186 旁白 neutral]]
They had found the Holy Tree, but it was unwilling to return. [[3187 旁白 neutral]]
Scholars searched through ancient texts until their hair turned white, and sages tried every method they could think of, but they still couldn't find a way to make the Holy Tree go home. As the supreme leader of the elves, Queen Lydia followed the ancient custom and knelt before the Holy Tree, refusing to rise. [[3188 旁白 neutral]]
She knelt for four years. During those four years, aside from her most basic needs, the Elf Queen dedicated all her time to this matter. With unwavering faith, she pleaded for the Holy Tree to return to its former home. [[3189 旁白 neutral]]
The queen led by example, and every elf saw her sacrifice. They were moved by her dedication, but the Holy Tree remained unmoved. [[3190 旁白 neutral]]
Four years wasn't a long time for the long-lived elves, but continuing on without any goal was not a solution. [[3191 旁白 neutral]]
After all, the Human Empire to the east was willing to sign a peace treaty with the elves, while the Demon Realm to the west saw the sudden appearance of the elves as an obstacle. Although the demons hadn't made any major moves in recent years due to the elves' strength, the longer this dragged on, the more their limited patience would wear thin... [[3192 旁白 fearful]]
Undine understood all this. As the princess of the elves, she saw things more clearly than most. But seeing the problem without a solution only made her more anxious. [[3193 旁白 neutral]]
Today seemed just like any other day in the past four years. Her mother was still kneeling before the Holy Tree, the tree was still motionless, and everyone could only wait helplessly as time passed... [[3194 旁白 sad]]
But to Undine's surprise, her mother, who never allowed anyone near her while she prayed, had her personal maid summon her today. [[3195 旁白 surprised]]
Undine had a feeling that her mother had called for her to assign an important task. [[3196 旁白 neutral]]
"Mother..." [[3197 温蒂尼 neutral]]
Hearing the familiar and gentle voice of the young girl, the Elf Queen, who had been kneeling for so long, slowly straightened up and turned her head. The moment mother and daughter met eyes, Undine almost burst into tears. [[3198 旁白 sad]]
In her memory, her mother was stunningly beautiful and graceful, the most beautiful woman in the world in her eyes. After four years of hardship, although her mother's appearance hadn't changed much, the weariness in her eyes was impossible to hide. [[3199 旁白 sad]]
"Undine, my daughter, do not be sad. This is my duty as queen." [[3200 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
Lydia reached out and gently caressed the girl's face. Even though she looked exhausted, the gentle warmth in her emerald eyes, which could melt winter snow, could not be hidden. [[3201 旁白 neutral]]
"I called you here today to give you a mission." [[3202 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"If there is anything I can do, Mother, please just ask. No matter how difficult, I will overcome it and not fail my mission!" [[3203 温蒂尼 neutral]]
Lydia looked at the determined elf girl before her, running her fingers through her soft golden hair with even more gentleness in her eyes. This was her daughter, a morning star as brilliant as the sun. If not for this accident, she should have been enjoying a better life in the Elf Forest, not suffering with her in this foreign land. [[3204 旁白 sad]]
"Good. With your words, I can rest assured." [[3205 莉蒂亚 happy]]
"Don't worry about me. I'm not asking you to do anything dangerous, but this is a task that only you can do..." [[3206 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
Undine immediately focused all her attention, listening carefully to her mother's every word. [[3207 旁白 neutral]]
"I need you to find the current Water Saintess." [[3208 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"Why?" [[3209 温蒂尼 surprised]]
The young girl looked into her mother's incredibly serious eyes, her face full of confusion. [[3210 旁白 neutral]]
"Because it concerns whether the Holy Tree can return home, and it also concerns the very survival of our elven race." [[3211 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"Don't object just yet. Listen to me..." [[3212 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
The Elf Queen closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if recalling a distant memory. After a long moment, she slowly opened her eyes. [[3213 旁白 neutral]]
"This is a very old story. My asking you to find the Water Saintess is not a desperate guess. It is because, from the perspective of power and heritage, the line of the Water Saintess has a significant connection with our elven race." [[3214 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
Undine held her breath, her eyes wide. She could feel her heart pounding. Every word entered her ears clearly, and as they came together, they wove a secret story from the past. [[3215 旁白 surprised]]
"Your court tutors and the books in the Great Tree Library should have told you that the elves are the kin of the Great Mother Goddess, a race created from her authority over life. That is why our race has a long lifespan and ageless beauty that countless other races envy..." [[3216 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"Besides us, do you know if the Great Mother Goddess has any other kin?" [[3217 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"Mother, are you talking about... the Merfolk?" [[3218 温蒂尼 neutral]]
Undine answered her mother's question without a moment's hesitation. [[3219 旁白 neutral]]
The Elf Queen nodded in satisfaction, but the emotion in her eyes grew more complex. [[3220 旁白 neutral]]
"Like our race, the Merfolk who live in the sea were born from the Mother Goddess's authority over peace. In temperament, the Merfolk are very similar to us; they dislike conflict. When I was young, I personally witnessed two aquatic clans fighting in the ocean. Broken scales mixed with blood, and the air was filled with the stench of death..." [[3221 莉蒂亚 sad]]
"This incredibly brutal war came to a sudden halt because of the appearance of a Merfolk. She appeared in the middle of the battlefield, singing a sacred song of peace. With the power of her voice alone, she stopped the slaughter." [[3222 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"But what does this have to do with the Water Saintess?" [[3223 温蒂尼 neutral]]
Undine was still confused. [[3224 旁白 neutral]]
"Undine, my daughter, let me ask you. On the Nephalem Continent today, since you were born, have you ever heard any information about the Merfolk, aside from what you've read in books?" [[3225 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
The girl shook her head like a rattle drum in response to her mother's question. [[3226 旁白 neutral]]
"After the Mother Goddess fell into slumber, the Merfolk were no longer active in the world, to the point of disappearing. The reasons for this are complex and would take too long to explain. But if we want to find a life with Merfolk blood on this continent today, the only possibility is the Winterlein family." [[3227 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"The reason is simple. The first-generation Water Saintess, appointed by the Human Church, was not human but the queen of the Merfolk. Legend says that the queen fell in love with a human and later had three daughters with him. This bloodline eventually became the current Water Saintess family." [[3228 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"The Holy Tree is a miracle created by the goddess's supreme power. The only ones who can move this power, besides us who inherited the goddess's blood, are the Merfolk, who are also the goddess's kin, and the Water Saintess, who has Merfolk blood." [[3229 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"The presence of the Water Saintess has been detected on this battlefield, yet The Church knows nothing about it. Undine, your only mission is to find her and bring her back..." [[3230 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
"Right now, she is the only one who can solve the elves' predicament." [[3231 莉蒂亚 neutral]]
The Elf Queen held her daughter's hand tightly, her tone so solemn it was as if she were placing the entire weight of her race on Undine's shoulders. [[3232 旁白 neutral]]
