Chapter 120: A Ruse? [[7041 旁白 neutral]]
    The dark room was instantly illuminated by emerald light. The brilliant radiance pierced through the dark mud, leaving it nowhere to hide. The crimson viscous liquid recoiled instantly as if it had met its nemesis, revealing the girl's fair skin once more. [[7042 旁白 neutral]]
    But that was all. The holy sword's light pushed back the defiled mud. However, the blood-streaked mud did not vanish into white smoke with a hiss the moment it encountered the holy light, unlike ordinary decaying breath. [[7043 旁白 neutral]]
    The crimson mud gathered into a mass, surging upwards to form the shape of a girl. The golden-haired, red-eyed vampire girl stood distantly opposite Celeste, her hands behind her back, a smile on her face. [[7044 旁白 neutral]]
    Their appearances were almost identical. If it weren't for the vampire's sharp ears and pale skin constantly reminding her, she might have truly been momentarily confused, mistaking this lifeless vampire in front of her for Seraphina. [[7045 旁白 neutral]]
    "It seems the first attempt failed. As expected, if the target of the first embrace is a Saintess, it's not so easy~" [[7046 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    Although the timbre was familiar, the tone was not as calm as Seraphina's usual manner, with a hint of playfulness in the trailing sound. [[7047 旁白 neutral]]
    "Avril" crossed her arms and chuckled softly, her gaze unconsciously drifting downwards, lingering subtly on the emerald holy sword guarding the girl. [[7048 旁白 neutral]]
    "Extracting others' memories to attack their weakest points at crucial moments. Although among demons, succubi are most skilled in illusions, you vampires are no less adept at manipulating human hearts." [[7049 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Celeste reached out and caught the emerald holy sword hovering beside her, her expression indifferent. [[7050 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh~ that's so mean~" [[7051 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "What do you mean by manipulating human hearts? I merely materialized your innermost thoughts in a different way. O wise Wind Saintess, do you dare say you've never had similar thoughts?" [[7052 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    The corners of "Avril's" mouth curved into a wicked smile, and her soft voice seemed to be imbued with enchanting demonic sounds. [[7053 旁白 neutral]]
    Celeste frowned. [[7054 旁白 neutral]]
    "Heh, even if you didn't speak, your expression already tells me you wavered, which means you indeed harbor such thoughts in your heart." [[7055 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "Avril" seemed to have caught a weakness, and the smile on her face grew more unrestrained. [[7056 旁白 neutral]]
    "Once a dark thought arises in the mind, it can never return to purity. Intelligent beings are complex, and dark thoughts are often a person's deepest desires and instincts..." [[7057 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "Instincts and desires can be suppressed, but you can never eradicate them. As long as they exist for even a day, you will need to expend countless efforts to pacify them." [[7058 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "But..." [[7059 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Inside the dark room, the environment changed once more. This time, it was no longer the squirming blood mud on the ground, but a silent, blood-red mist spreading through the air. The mist blurred light and vision, entering the nasal cavity with each breath. [[7060 旁白 neutral]]
    Hallucinations and phantom sounds followed one after another— [[7061 旁白 neutral]]
    "People will always have moments of exhaustion. At that time, instincts and desires will overcome reason. You will return to your truest self, and thus make the choices you are destined to make." [[7062 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    The voice attacked from behind once more. The blood-red mist conjured two fair hands that embraced Celeste from behind. The girl drew her sword and slashed; the swift wind tore apart the mist illusions but could never inflict real damage on the source of the voice. [[7063 旁白 neutral]]
    The enchanting voice echoed in her ears again and again. The human figures conjured by the mist changed in countless ways, sometimes transforming into Isabella, sometimes into Seraphina, and sometimes becoming the girl's mother who had passed away too young... [[7064 旁白 neutral]]
    All were unforgettable faces, familiar voices, yet they stimulated and peeled back the darkest thoughts buried deep within the girl's heart again and again. [[7065 旁白 neutral]]
    The wind repeatedly dispersed the conjured mist, but it could never dispel the demonic sounds and shadows in her heart, as if things were truly as "she" said, that these were Celeste's innermost thoughts. [[7066 旁白 neutral]]
    Finally, after countless swings, the girl's movements became heavier and slower. Until at last, exhausted, she half-knelt on the ground, the holy sword half-embedded in the earth, her hand gripping the hilt trembling slightly. [[7067 旁白 fearful]]
    Sweat streamed down her cheeks like rain. Her silk dress was completely soaked with bodily fluids. An eerie wind blew, closing the window. The formerly cozy and airy room instantly became a small, dark cage. [[7068 旁白 fearful]]
    The transparent window glass seemed to be covered by mist, only barely allowing her to discern the blood moon hanging high in the sky. [[7069 旁白 fearful]]
    "Give up, this is your fate." [[7070 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    The blood-red mist used the same trick again, transforming into Avril's appearance and embracing the half-kneeling girl after regenerating, attempting to torment the trapped beast until exhaustion, using this "gentle embrace" to make the other party completely give up resistance. [[7071 旁白 neutral]]
    But it still failed. [[7072 旁白 neutral]]
    As the illusory "Avril's" red lips approached the girl's fair neck, opening to reveal white fangs, just about to bite, the wind of the azure mist once again tore apart this scheme. [[7073 旁白 neutral]]
    The girl, holding her sword, struggled to stand up from where she was. Pure white feathers swirled around her, cleaving open a divine domain. [[7074 旁白 neutral]]
    [Domain: Clear Wisdom Empty Domain of a Thousand Feathers] [[7075 旁白 neutral]]
    The red mist, which had been thwarted countless times, re-condensed in a corner far from the domain. But this time, the mist did not transform into any familiar figure from Celeste's memories, but instead revealed his truest appearance—Duke Vlad. [[7076 旁白 neutral]]
    His silver short hair was eerie. His face was handsome. He wore a blood-red coat, and his slender, blood-red eyes were always full of playful amusement. [[7077 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh~ that's truly remarkable. After rejecting my invitations so many times, you still have the strength to open a domain in the spiritual world." [[7078 弗拉德 neutral]]
    As he spoke, he applauded admiringly like a gentleman. [[7079 旁白 neutral]]
    "No matter how you change and twist it, these are my memories. Using my abilities within my memories, there's no problem with that, right?" [[7080 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    Celeste casually wiped away the fine beads of sweat from her forehead. Though her emerald eyes were still bright, an undeniable shadow of weariness had crept into them. [[7081 旁白 neutral]]
    "Of course, no problem, my future bride~" [[7082 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "It must be very tiring to keep your domain open, right? You've used willpower, the holy sword, and your domain of authority. Your trump cards are all used up~ What will you use to refuse me next time?" [[7083 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Vlad was not annoyed by Celeste's repeated rejections in the slightest. In his eyes, this was merely a bride throwing a small tantrum before marriage. Rather, it was only girls who would "put up a desperate fight" like this that would further increase his interest in this wedding. [[7084 旁白 neutral]]
    "As long as the domain doesn't perish, there will always be a chance." [[7085 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    The exhausted Saintess facing the Grand Duke who was certain of victory. This courage, like an egg hitting a rock, made Vlad's eerie eyes glint with even more amusement. [[7086 旁白 neutral]]
    "Human Saintesses are truly innocently cute. A chance? Where would a chance come from?" [[7087 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "You can't possibly break the first embrace ritual with your own strength alone, can you?" [[7088 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "To tell you the truth, your current body is no different from a vampire's. Nearly half of all the blood in your body comes from me, and the other half is deeply imprinted with vampire genes..." [[7089 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "With your body and blood no longer truly your own, your soul is essentially trapped in a specific sealed room. For your consciousness to leave this room and awaken, you must acknowledge your vampire identity, and once you acknowledge it..." [[7090 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Vlad deliberately did not continue speaking, but instead smiled at the girl with a meaningful gaze. [[7091 旁白 neutral]]
    "With my strength alone, it is indeed difficult to achieve." [[7092 塞莱斯特 neutral]]
    After a prolonged struggle, Vlad undoubtedly held the absolute advantage. The reason Celeste could still buy time was by relying on a portion of the authority granted by her divine bloodline. The authority of wisdom made it easier for her to detect loopholes and weaknesses, while the authority of freedom could ensure the purity of her soul. [[7093 旁白 neutral]]
    But she was not a deity after all. Even partial authority, if used for a long time, would be a great burden on her soul. [[7094 旁白 neutral]]
    This was a struggle of a trapped beast. She herself was a "rare and exotic beast" that Vlad absolutely had to obtain in his eyes. [[7095 旁白 neutral]]
    "Even someone as clever as you will ultimately not escape my grasp~" [[7096 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Perhaps out of an inner twisted pleasure, Vlad's voice once again turned into a girl's charming one, and as his form twisted, he transformed into Avril's appearance. [[7097 旁白 neutral]]
    It was thought that facing this twisted pleasure, Celeste would still resist with silence as before, but unexpectedly... [[7098 旁白 neutral]]
    "Annoying!" [[7099 塞莱斯特 angry]]
    The girl's furious roar broke Vlad's rhythm. The furious wind, guided by her sword, directly shattered "Avril's" form, and the mist throughout the room was stirred by this sudden tempest. [[7100 旁白 neutral]]
    Celeste looked at the mist that was struggling to coalesce in the corner, and said with icy eyes. [[7101 旁白 neutral]]
    "Actually, I've wanted to say this for a long time. My earlier frown wasn't because your words struck a chord with me; it was simply my disgust at you wearing Seraphina's face and saying such repulsive things. There's no need to pretend to be anyone in front of me..." [[7102 塞莱斯特 angry]]
    "Because in my eyes, no matter how you change, you are ultimately just a pile of decaying flesh, like a walking corpse!" [[7103 塞莱斯特 angry]]
    In the corner, Vlad, whose recovery speed had visibly slowed, finally lost the smug smile he had earlier. It was unknown whether his previous words had struck a dark chord in Celeste's heart, but Celeste's recent words clearly hit a raw nerve with him. [[7104 旁白 neutral]]
    "Decaying flesh?" [[7105 弗拉德 angry]]
    He meticulously chewed on these four words with his gloomy eyes, as if they were something he utterly abhorred. [[7106 旁白 neutral]]
    "Isn't that right? Freed from the shackles of time, unable to embrace even death, a shattered soul self-imprisoned within a seemingly splendid yet internally rotten corpse, numbly dragging decaying legs step by step, degenerating into an undead monster." [[7107 塞莱斯特 angry]]
    The girl's voice was clear and resonant, like sharp swords piercing through Vlad's seemingly splendid facade. His expression became even more sinister, and his outward composure could no longer be maintained. [[7108 旁白 neutral]]
    "Alright, alright... remember what you're saying now. Soon, I will make you personally experience becoming the very thing you abhorred the most!" [[7109 弗拉德 angry]]
    The blood-colored aura suddenly expanded and collided with the domain of a thousand white feathers. The ritual had evidently reached its final critical moment. [[7110 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[7111 旁白 neutral]]
    ... [[7112 旁白 neutral]]
    On one side of the altar, two intertwined red blood lights were so fast that only afterimages could be seen. The collisions between the rapier and the longsword, each strike would erupt with unimaginable impact. [[7113 旁白 neutral]]
    Close-quarters combat between vampires. Due to their immortality and extremely high recovery characteristics, the need for dodging and defense was greatly reduced. With no schemes or mental battles, all that remained was pure, instinctive slaughter. [[7114 旁白 neutral]]
    Losing limbs became common. But this was of no consequence to vampires. [[7115 旁白 neutral]]
    Sigrid delivered a fierce kick that directly broke Vlad's waist, who couldn't dodge in time. The sound of his spine cracking and muscles tearing was clearly audible, but only a fleeting pain flashed across Vlad's face, and the broken bones and rotten flesh quickly reconnected, recovering in the blink of an eye. [[7116 旁白 neutral]]
    Tempered by countless years, Vlad's swordsmanship had also reached its pinnacle. He had more than once used the longsword in his hand to chop off Sigrid's arms, but alas, the opponent's self-healing ability was even more outrageous than his; before he could press his advantage, the girl's severed arms would either reattach or new flesh and bone would regenerate directly. [[7117 旁白 neutral]]
    If this continued, given the life force and immortal characteristics of both, it would be difficult to determine a victor even if they fought here for seven days and seven nights. [[7118 旁白 neutral]]
    It wasn't that Vlad hadn't considered creating distance and using large-scale, high-intensity blood magic to indiscriminately bomb the group. But firstly, the ritual was still ongoing, and indiscriminate bombing would certainly interrupt it due to external factors. Secondly, this new vampire in front of him was truly abominable! [[7119 旁白 neutral]]
    Vlad had already cursed several times in his heart. It wasn't that he didn't use magic, nor that he didn't want to be a proper spellcaster and instead wanted to be a melee sword knight, but reality simply didn't allow it! [[7120 旁白 neutral]]
    As is well known, high-intensity, large-area magic requires incantation, and the duration of incantation is affected by the caster's own strength and proficiency. For a Rank Six powerhouse like Vlad, magic below mid-tier could be cast without incantation, high-tier magic could be cast instantly, while super-tier magic required some preparation time. Facing a Rank Five vampire and gaining little advantage in close combat, casting magic would at least need to be high-tier to inflict effective damage, but... [[7121 旁白 neutral]]
    The woman in front of him anticipated his every move. Vampires' most proficient magic was nothing more than blood magic and shadow magic, and the brief wind-ups and incantations before these spells were cast were precisely seized and interrupted by the girl. It was as if she was familiar with all release methods and details related to blood magic and shadow magic, giving him no opportunity for a magic duel at all. [[7122 旁白 neutral]]
    Without a doubt, the battle had reached a stalemate. It was difficult for two immortal monsters to determine a victor in a short time. Even if they fought until the morning sun appeared, sunlight's effect on high-tier vampires was almost negligible. [[7123 旁白 neutral]]
    But it didn't matter; the ritual would soon be over. He could feel the Wind Saintess's resistance growing weaker and weaker. He just needed to wait patiently for another 40 seconds; 40 seconds later would be his time to laugh heartily! [[7124 旁白 neutral]]
    As for that witch? [[7125 旁白 neutral]]
    Avril was handling the witch; nothing would go wrong... [[7126 旁白 neutral]]
    Wait! [[7127 弗拉德 surprised]]
    Vlad's expression suddenly turned to confusion. In his perception, why was their battle increasingly shifting towards the direction of the cross? [[7128 旁白 neutral]]
    No, what if the aftermath of the battle accidentally destroyed the ritual? That would be a huge loss! [[7129 弗拉德 fearful]]
    Thinking of this, Vlad immediately split a portion of his mind, and using his abilities as a high-ranking vampire and master, issued a command to Avril. [[7130 旁白 neutral]]
    "Avril, stop getting closer to the inverted cross. I command you to immediately take that witch and leave the ritual's central area!" [[7131 弗拉德 angry]]
    The moment his words fell, Sigrid seized Vlad's momentary distraction. The rapier in her hand struck fiercely, accurately piercing Vlad's throat, and instantly, blood splattered. [[7132 旁白 neutral]]
    Suffocation and excruciating pain instantly contorted Vlad's facial expression. But none of that mattered, as long as... [[7133 旁白 neutral]]
    Eh? Eh? Eh? [[7134 弗拉德 surprised]]
    His peripheral vision suddenly caught sight of something. The golden-haired figure, whom he had trained to be completely submissive to him, inexplicably had a cross-shaped spear in her hand at some point. Her body leaned slightly back, adopting a throwing posture, and the direction the spearhead pointed was precisely the Wind Saintess on the inverted cross! [[7135 旁白 surprised]]
    What the--?! [[7136 弗拉德 surprised]]
    PS: To explain again, the magical girl book hasn't been abandoned. It's just that due to Shenhe's questions, it's highly likely that over 30 chapters need to be revised. Moreover, even after revision, it's not guaranteed to pass. There are also limits on the number of times one can apply for review after daily revisions, so it will take a relatively long time. It's not abandoned, not abandoned. I'm also swamped over here... [[7137 旁白 neutral]]
