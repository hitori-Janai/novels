Chapter 96: A Thirty-Seventy Split [[5387 旁白 neutral]]
The erosion of blood was stopped, and a wind, replacing the damp darkness, filled the entire area. [[5388 旁白 neutral]]
After the Saintess of Wind unleashed her domain, wit triumphed over raw power. Watching the blood "slip" at his feet, Andre's lips curled into a slight smile. [[5389 旁白 neutral]]
He knew it. Anyone who could become a Saintess had to have a few tricks up her sleeve. [[5390 安德烈 neutral]]
The MVP of the team was making her move. The whole party became immune to negative effects and received a pile of buffs. The priest in white and the gray-haired nun seized the moment, their cross-spear and gunblade striking the metal coffin in unison. [[5391 旁白 neutral]]
"Thud!" [[5392 旁白 neutral]]
With a dull thud, the spatial matrix inscribed on the ground, long since prepared, activated instantly. A silvery light mixed with blood enveloped the object's surface, distorting the light for a moment, and the "iron box" that everyone had worked on for so long suddenly vanished. [[5393 旁白 neutral]]
As if sensing a part of itself had disappeared, the blood that had overflowed from the pool began to retreat in a bizarre manner. The phenomenon of "spilled water returning," defying all logic, unfolded perfectly before everyone's eyes. [[5394 旁白 neutral]]
As the last drop of blood returned to the pool, the dry ground looked as if it had never been flooded. The immense drain on her spirit and magic left Isabella with no energy to spare. She gripped her spear and collapsed to the ground, her ragged breaths echoing through the space. [[5395 旁白 neutral]]
Andre, holding his sword, shifted slightly to stand protectively in front of Isabella. As long as Celeste's domain remained active, this exhaustion and fatigue would be quickly replenished. [[5396 旁白 neutral]]
"It's done. The first coffin has been successfully transferred." [[5397 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
Only when the voice of Seraphina, who was controlling the spatial matrix, was heard did everyone breathe a small sigh of relief. [[5398 旁白 neutral]]
With some color returning to her face, Isabella used her spear to struggle to her feet. She glanced at the priest standing before her. His tall, strong body was like a thick wall, shielding her from all danger. A ripple stirred in the depths of the girl's golden-brown eyes. [[5399 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you, Andre." [[5400 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
"Got your strength back?" [[5401 安德烈 angry]]
The man glanced back at her and said irritably. [[5402 旁白 neutral]]
"It's too early for thanks. Don't let your guard down." [[5403 安德烈 neutral]]
"Mm." [[5404 伊莎贝拉 neutral]]
Isabella tightened her grip on the cross-spear and nodded. [[5405 旁白 neutral]]
Although she agreed obediently, her tense spirit couldn't help but relax a little. Her golden-brown eyes looked up at the holy and divine figure floating in mid-air, shining with admiration. [[5406 旁白 neutral]]
In her heart, as long as Her Highness made a move, any problem would be solved. [[5407 旁白 neutral]]
The Saintess who symbolized freedom would never be shackled by hardship or fate. [[5408 旁白 neutral]]
The blue and white saintess robe danced wildly in the wind. Saintess Celeste's white-feathered, emerald eyes locked onto the last coffin in the pool. Since she had chosen to use her full strength, she decided to press the advantage and finish quickly, before any more time passed and other accidents occurred. [[5409 旁白 neutral]]
The white-feathered divine wind surrounded the coffin in the pool with unstoppable force. The spiraling wind churned the water, intending to lift the coffin against gravity. Under the influence of the wind field, the metal coffin began to rise slowly. Just as half of it had emerged from the water, the once-calm pool erupted with a crimson glow once more. [[5410 旁白 neutral]]
A sudden burst of blood mist scattered the wind field Celeste had gathered. The strange blood rushed out from the pool again. This time, its target was not the immune party members; it flowed across the ground, writhing and twisting as it gathered into a human form. [[5411 旁白 neutral]]
"My beautiful Saintess, such an impatient approach doesn't quite suit a noble lady, you know~" [[5412 卡斯迪安•罗森克鲁兹 neutral]]
From the twisted blood, a blue-haired vampire in distinctly Gothic attire stepped out. His pale skin was particularly striking in the dim environment, and his crimson eyes held a hint of cunning and playfulness. [[5413 旁白 neutral]]
Of course. He knew it wouldn't be that simple. [[5414 安德烈 neutral]]
Upon seeing the sudden appearance of the blue-haired vampire, Andre showed no surprise at all. If a critical mission like this didn't have a few twists and turns, he would suspect he was in an illusion. [[5415 旁白 neutral]]
The course of fate is unpredictable, but its arrangements are sometimes traceable. For example, at a key moment with a key character, how could it let you pass so easily? [[5416 旁白 neutral]]
"Your Highness, be careful!" [[5417 伊莎贝拉 fearful]]
In her agitation, Isabella gripped her cross-spear and was about to charge forward, but the man blocked her path with his arm. [[5418 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't attack rashly at a time like this, or you'll just give the enemy an opening." [[5419 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre's voice was devoid of emotion. His calm and steady tone instantly cooled Isabella's impulsive mood. [[5420 旁白 neutral]]
"Stay on high alert. It's just a Tier 4 vampire. Your Saintess can handle it." [[5421 安德烈 neutral]]
The man's turquoise eyes reflected the seemingly elegant vampire, but he scoffed inwardly. It was just an exquisite shell meant to deceive people. In reality, the stench of rotten roses from him was nauseating even from several meters away. [[5422 旁白 neutral]]
"As expected, you creatures will never behave if you're given even the slightest chance." [[5423 赛莱斯特 angry]]
The girl's voice, carried by the divine wind, was ethereal and her posture heroic. Her emerald, white-feathered pupils narrowed slightly. [[5424 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't attempt a useless counterattack, and don't try to bluff. I know Grand Duke Vlad is the one behind you, but you and I both know that a Tier 6 powerhouse cannot cross the Empire's border barrier undetected. With you alone..." [[5425 赛莱斯特 angry]]
"You won't succeed in your scheme!" [[5426 赛莱斯特 angry]]
The emerald wind had already sealed off all of the blue-haired vampire's escape routes. With a single command from Celeste, the wind spirits in the air would turn into tiny, sharp blades and slice the smirking vampire into mincemeat. [[5427 旁白 neutral]]
"Oh, don't be so hasty, beautiful Saintess! You know, we nobles are always reluctant to harm beautiful things. Perhaps because we've just met, you don't have a deep enough understanding of me. I can give a brief self-introduction..." [[5428 卡斯迪安•罗森克鲁兹 neutral]]
"My name is Castien Rosencrantz. I am a noble vampire Count, but you may also call me the Rose Count. I have come this time with the utmost sincerity and..." [[5429 卡斯迪安•罗森克鲁兹 neutral]]
The Rose Count spread his arms, performing with exaggerated and dramatic expressions. As his body took a single step forward, a sharp wind slash carved a trench of moderate depth right in front of his shoe. [[5430 旁白 neutral]]
"Step back!" [[5431 赛莱斯特 angry]]
The green-haired girl held up two fingers like a sword, and a green magic, both gentle and wild, swirled around them. [[5432 旁白 neutral]]
"One more step, and the 'scar' on the ground will be your fate." [[5433 赛莱斯特 angry]]
The seemingly delicate girl showed incredible maturity and toughness at this moment, not letting her guard down even against a weaker enemy. [[5434 旁白 neutral]]
Feeling the undisguised sacred aura at the center of the domain, Andre's mind began to turn, making a comparison. [[5435 旁白 neutral]]
Due to the gods' blessing, a Saintess was at least Tier 5. He had heard about this suddenly appearing Rose Count from Sasha; he was a veteran Tier 4, stuck on the edge of a breakthrough to Tier 5. [[5436 旁白 neutral]]
A Tier 5 against a Tier 4. Although the Rose Count had the vampire's racial talent, making his immortal attribute difficult to deal with in a fight, he was facing a Saintess who was a tier higher and naturally possessed divine power. [[5437 旁白 neutral]]
Before Tier 6, divinity countered everything. If he were to make a chart comparing them, their chances of winning would be a thirty-seventy split... [[5438 旁白 neutral]]
Celeste could cut this annoying vampire into seven pieces in three minutes. [[5439 旁白 neutral]]
