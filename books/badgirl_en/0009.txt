Chapter 9: Reset 9 - Echoes of the Past [[478 旁白 neutral]]
It hurts... memories... it feels like they're evaporating! [[479 塞伦安 fearful]]
"Hey, little crybaby, what are you doing curled up in the corner by yourself?" [[480 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Don't... don't come over..." [[481 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
"Why are you hiding from me? It's not like I'm going to eat you." [[482 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I... I..." [[483 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
"Wow, your hands are so cold! They feel nice. You're like a human ice cube. Holding your hand is even cooler than my family's icehouse~" [[484 塞伦安 happy]]
"Let go! Or you'll... wait, you... you're okay?" [[485 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Why would something happen to me? I am blessed by the gods. Your body is a bit cold, but I'm just holding your hand. Nothing to be surprised about." [[486 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Hey, little crybaby, we meet again~" [[487 塞伦安 happy]]
"You, you are... you're that guy who held my hand last time!" [[488 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Hey, what do you mean 'that guy'? You're so impolite. You're a young lady from the Glacies family, how can you have no noble manners?" [[489 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I-I'm sorry, I, I..." [[490 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Alright, alright, don't look like you're about to cry. Here, this little flower is for you. Stop crying, or when your family sees, they'll think I'm bullying you~" [[491 塞伦安 neutral]]
"No, I can't touch flowers, I..." [[492 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
"Take it when I tell you to!" [[493 塞伦安 angry]]
"Huh?! The flower isn't affected? It didn't freeze?" [[494 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Hmph~ Impressive, right?" [[495 塞伦安 happy]]
"It's so beautiful... What's this flower's name?" [[496 瑟蕾妮娅 happy]]
"Ice Beauty. I picked it from the garden in your outer courtyard. But you're strange. It's a flower from your own home, yet you look at it like you've never seen it before." [[497 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I-I'm sorry... I rarely get to leave my room, and I've never left the inner courtyard..." [[498 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Is that so... It's alright. Next time, if there's anything you want to eat or play with, just tell me, and I'll bring it to you." [[499 塞伦安 happy]]
"R-Really?!" [[500 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Of course~ What kind of person am I? I always keep my word. Would I lie to a little crybaby like you?" [[501 塞伦安 happy]]
"Then can you... spend more time with me?" [[502 瑟蕾妮娅 hopeful]]
"Huh?" [[503 塞伦安 surprised]]
"Little crybaby, I'm here to play with you again~" [[504 塞伦安 happy]]
"Selen An, I-I've told you many times, I have a name. It's not 'little crybaby'." [[505 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Nicknames are easier to remember than names, right, little crybaby~" [[506 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Wuu..." [[507 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Hey, alright, alright. I'll use your name, just don't cry, okay? Ahem... Bena, your loyal knight Selen An has come to fulfill his promise, as we agreed." [[508 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Thank you..." [[509 瑟蕾妮娅 happy]]
"What did you say? I didn't hear you clearly." [[510 塞伦安 neutral]]
"N-Nothing. Let's go play in the backyard." [[511 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
"Why are you crying? Did someone bully you?" [[512 塞伦安 neutral]]
"N-No, Selen An, why are you here?" [[513 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Why can't I be here? I'm an honored guest at your house~ Honestly, as soon as this honored guest walked in, I saw someone curled up in a corner crying~" [[514 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I-I'm sorry..." [[515 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Don't always apologize to me. You haven't done anything wrong." [[516 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I, I..." [[517 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"It's because of your bloodline, isn't it? Those people fear the uncontrollable power in your blood, so they've imprisoned you in this tiny room. Am I right, Serenia?" [[518 塞伦安 neutral]]
"You, you know who I am?!" [[519 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"Yes, I know. 'Bena' is just a fake name. Your real identity is the eldest daughter of the Glacies family, Serenia. I've also heard people say you're not the descendant of a Saintess, but the Ice Calamity Witch." [[520 塞伦安 neutral]]
"N-No, that's not true... I, I... Don't leave..." [[521 瑟蕾妮娅 fearful]]
"Sigh, don't cry again. I can't stand seeing girls cry." [[522 塞伦安 sad]]
"Okay, I'm not here to say goodbye to you. I won't leave you, I swear. As for those rumors outside, I don't pay any attention to them at all. What calamity, what witch, it's all just nonsense!" [[523 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I've been by your side for so long, and I haven't been frozen into an ice cube. It hasn't affected me at all. You see, it's just idle gossip from outsiders, with no credibility." [[524 塞伦安 neutral]]
"But I..." [[525 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"No buts. Don't tell me you're actually going to say you're the Ice Calamity Witch? Don't be ridiculous. I know you. You still look like you're about to cry. How is that like a witch? You're clearly just a little crybaby!" [[526 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Selen An..." [[527 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Besides... about the bloodline, well, forget it. I have nothing to hide from you. The Saintess bloodline itself is extremely difficult to control. Your situation is that your power is overflowing and you can't control it effectively." [[528 塞伦安 neutral]]
"For me, my bloodline is dormant and hasn't awakened. Of course, this is only temporary. With my talent, it won't be long before I fully awaken the power in my blood!" [[529 塞伦安 happy]]
"So... our situations are very similar?" [[530 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
"What do you mean similar? My situation is much better than yours... Ahem, of course, your foundation isn't bad. But if you want to catch up to me, you'll have to work a lot harder, little crybaby~" [[531 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Mhm! I will, Brother Selen An." [[532 瑟蕾妮娅 happy]]
"If you want to catch up to me, you'll have to work harder. First, you need to get rid of this habit of crying. I heard from the adults that not crying is a sign of growing up. Only by growing up quickly can you become as strong as me." [[533 塞伦安 neutral]]
"I-I will stop my crying habit. One day, I will catch up to Brother Selen An." [[534 瑟蕾妮娅 happy]]
"Then let's pinky swear." [[535 塞伦安 neutral]]
"Pinky swear, for a hundred years, you can't take it back!" [[536 瑟蕾妮娅 happy]]
"Hey, did you see? That witch was actually let out!" [[537 陌生男1 surprised]]
"I saw her. How could I not? A little girl with silver hair on the street in broad daylight, it's hard to miss!" [[538 陌生男2 neutral]]
"What is the Glacies family thinking?" [[539 陌生男1 neutral]]
"But speaking of which, that little girl doesn't seem as scary as the rumors say. I dared to get a closer look, and besides the temperature dropping a few degrees around her, there was nothing unusual. She doesn't seem like a calamity witch at all." [[540 陌生男2 neutral]]
"You were just charmed by her appearance. The knights have said that witch is very good at charming people. Once she gets a chance, she'll freeze you into a block of ice!" [[541 陌生男1 fearful]]
"Hey, did you hear?" [[542 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Hear what?" [[543 陌生男2 neutral]]
"I work at the Count's mansion, and I was lucky enough to learn that the Count recently received an invitation from the Glacies family." [[544 陌生男1 neutral]]
"What's so surprising about that? The Glacies family is a sacred Saintess family. Isn't it normal for a Saintess family to hold a sacred ritual or send out banquet invitations?" [[545 陌生男2 neutral]]
"No, no, no, this time it's not normal. This invitation is for our Count to attend that witch's birthday banquet!" [[546 陌生男1 surprised]]
"What?! The Glacies family is actually throwing a birthday party for that witch? I remember that they used to do everything they could to hide the girl's existence and identity. If it weren't for the great vision she caused at birth, no one would even know she exists~" [[547 陌生男2 surprised]]
"Isn't that the truth?" [[548 陌生男1 neutral]]
"This world is getting stranger and stranger. Just a few years ago, everyone stayed far away from the eldest daughter of the Glacies family, and the streets were full of rumors calling her a witch. I can't believe that now..." [[549 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Be careful what you say, brother! What do you mean, 'witch'? She's now the successor to the Saintess. As soon as she turns sixteen, she will be Her Highness, the true Saintess!" [[550 陌生男2 fearful]]
"What a huge change. Just a few days ago, I saw that young lady on the street. In the past, wherever she walked, you wouldn't see a single person. Now, if you want to get a close look at the little Saintess, you're completely blocked by the surrounding knights and maids." [[551 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Isn't that the truth? A large group of attendants and maids surround her, making it impossible to get close. In the past, whenever she was on the street, she was always alone, with only the young master of the Winterlein family occasionally by her side..." [[552 陌生男2 neutral]]
"That one from the Winterlein family...唉, let's not talk about it. They used to walk together, but now one is in heaven and the other on earth." [[553 陌生男1 sad]]
"What do you mean?" [[554 陌生男2 neutral]]
"Times have changed~ It used to be the little Saintess following that boy around. Now, the little Saintess's status has been confirmed, while the young master of the Winterlein family,呵呵, has consumed countless treasures, and even the Pope of The Church has sent nuns to assist him, but he still can't awaken his bloodline. He's just like you and me, an ordinary person who can't use a single spell~" [[555 陌生男1 neutral]]
"Enough! Stop showing off in front of me!" [[556 塞伦安 angry]]
"I know you've awakened your bloodline, and I know you'll be a high and mighty Saintess in the future, so please stop bothering me!" [[557 塞伦安 angry]]
"That's not it... Brother Selen An, I just wanted to share this joy with you, I didn't mean to..." [[558 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Shut up!" [[559 塞伦安 angry]]
"Every sound you make seems to be mocking me, every word feels like it's satirizing me. Your very presence disgusts me!" [[560 塞伦安 angry]]
"That's not it, it's not like that, I..." [[561 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"If it's not like that, then how is it? Do you know what the maid guarding your door said to me when I went to your house yesterday?!" [[562 塞伦安 angry]]
"She told me to stay away from you, said I wasn't worthy to stand by your side. A mere servant dared to mock me with such an arrogant tone. Is that possible without your and your family's silent approval?!! Answer me!!" [[563 塞伦安 angry]]
"I... didn't..." [[564 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
"Full of lies. I won't believe another word you say. I treated you like a friend, like my own little sister, but you betrayed me. Now, you've become the high and mighty Saintess, and what about me? 呵呵..." [[565 塞伦安 sad]]
"I've become the background to highlight you, the noble Saintess!" [[566 塞伦安 angry]]
"What a transformation from an ugly duckling to a swan, what a case of a toad wanting to eat swan meat... Serenia, you and your family make me sick. Get out of here! Get out of my room! You are never welcome here!" [[567 塞伦安 angry]]
"Serenia, I hate you! The sight of your face makes me want to vomit. Stop pretending to be a holy Saintess. Get out! I never want to see you again!" [[568 塞伦安 angry]]
"I'm sorry..." [[569 瑟蕾妮娅 sad]]
His head felt as if it had been pierced by a steel bar. Countless familiar yet strange memories flooded into his brain without reason. The pain was so intense it felt like his skull would split open, leaving him in agony every single moment. [[570 旁白 fearful]]
Countless voices echoed one after another, the echoes of the past. The conversation between the boy and the girl stretched from the past to the present. The memories drew closer and closer with the passage of time, until his brain could temporarily hold no more, and the pain finally eased slightly... [[571 旁白 neutral]]
Those memories... who do they belong to? [[572 塞伦安 confused]]
In his unconscious state, his mind was a chaotic mess. Faced with an ocean of memories, his unclear consciousness only felt a deep sense of confusion. [[573 旁白 neutral]]
Those familiar voices, those fragmented images, all felt as if he had experienced them himself. Yet subconsciously, he seemed to have an instinctive resistance and distance towards them. [[574 旁白 neutral]]
It was as if accepting those memories would lead to something unpredictable. [[575 旁白 fearful]]
Gradually, his sinking consciousness broke free from the ocean of memories and returned to his body. He could slowly feel his physical existence again, and the aching pain that came from every part of him. [[576 旁白 neutral]]
The strong scent of medicine stimulated him to wake up faster. When he finally forced his eyelids open and didn't sense the heavy, murderous atmosphere of a battlefield, a guess instinctively formed in his mind. [[577 旁白 neutral]]
Did I... manage to survive? [[578 塞伦安 hopeful]]
