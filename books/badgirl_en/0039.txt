Chapter 39: Reset 39 - The Ancient Tree of Life [[2216 旁白 neutral]]
For the first time, the battle-hungry demons found themselves in a situation where they couldn't fight. [[2217 旁白 neutral]]
Kogsag would never have guessed that the most impossible challenge of his demonic life would be the inability to attack. [[2218 旁白 surprised]]
His body rejected his soul's commands to fight. This feeling, like his mind was at war with itself, felt like the greatest insult he had ever received. [[2219 旁白 angry]]
As a proud demon lord, he could only watch as a great victory lay within his grasp, unable to act. The helpless frustration fueled his inner rage like kindling to a fire. [[2220 旁白 angry]]
Finally, spurred by the terrifying power inside him, his crimson demonic energy savagely tore through the invisible restraint. The dark armor covering his skin screamed as it cracked. [[2221 旁白 angry]]
In an instant, cracks like a spiderweb covered his body, and deep red hellfire erupted from them. His overwhelming killing intent finally broke the "will to not fight." [[2222 旁白 angry]]
Although his body still felt uncomfortable from resisting his own commands, it was no longer a problem for Kogsag. [[2223 旁白 neutral]]
His fiery, demonic eyes locked onto the two of them like a top predator. A wide, cruel smile spread across his face. [[2224 旁白 fearful]]
"You two... Now that your little 'no-fight' trick is gone, I'll make you pay for making a fool of me!" [[2225 克格萨 angry]]
A heaven-shaking roar pierced the clouds, and his killing intent was so strong it felt real. [[2226 旁白 fearful]]
The helmet on his head shattered from the violent magic, revealing the demon lord's true face. He had the face of a leopard and eyes of fire, a perfect match for the legendary Duke of Hell, Flauros. [[2227 旁白 surprised]]
Considering he had reshaped his body with hellfire earlier, this general of the Demon Clan must have the blood of the demon god in his veins. [[2228 旁白 neutral]]
Hellfire rose and swirled around him. The intense heat turned the ground he stood on to scorched earth. The poor grass and flowers that had just begun to grow near him were instantly destroyed. [[2229 旁白 sad]]
Serenia sensed the danger and, despite her weakness, instinctively moved to protect Lobelia. She didn't even understand why she reacted that way. [[2230 旁白 surprised]]
She still didn't know who the person behind her was. The nickname "little crybaby" gave her a clue, but the idea was so wild that she couldn't accept it until she heard it from the person herself. [[2231 旁白 neutral]]
But so what if she was a stranger they had just met? [[2232 旁白 neutral]]
She had to protect anyone from the Winterlein family. [[2233 旁白 neutral]]
It wasn't just the faint sense of familiarity about her, but a deep stirring in her own blood. [[2234 旁白 neutral]]
The loving Water God would sacrifice her life for the suffering of all, and the disciplined Ice God would deliver judgment on the hopeless for the Water God. [[2235 旁白 neutral]]
Just as only his touch could keep the biting cold from her hand. [[2236 旁白 neutral]]
"Go! This isn't your battlefield. Please stand behind me and offer support. Leave the fighting to me." [[2237 瑟蕾妮娅 neutral]]
Frost descended as she gripped her ice sword, her voice urgent as she stood protectively in front of the girl. [[2238 旁白 neutral]]
From their brief interaction, she now understood the situation. This new Water Saintess's abilities were miraculous, but she had a clear weakness: her aura was not strong. She was definitely not a fighter. [[2239 旁白 neutral]]
Of course, this wasn't unusual. From all the books Serenia had read, the Water Saintesses of the past were never skilled in combat. [[2240 旁白 neutral]]
After all, they were descendants of that loving goddess. [[2241 旁白 neutral]]
The balance of 'no-fight' had been broken. Now, it was time for a clash between judgment and hell. [[2242 旁白 neutral]]
As Serenia thought this, the blue-haired girl behind her watched her back. Her gaze then shifted to the scorched earth beneath Kogsag's feet. For the first time, a ripple disturbed her calm, water-blue eyes. [[2243 旁白 neutral]]
It was a feeling of heartache. Even if it was just a tiny sting, the pain was like a stone thrown into the calm lake of her heart, shattering her peace. [[2244 旁白 sad]]
Seeing the two on high alert, Kogsag's smile grew wider. He pulled a dark scroll from his shattered armor, and flames burned away its seal. [[2245 旁白 neutral]]
With a flick of his wrist, the scroll opened, revealing dense, forbidden runes. Before Serenia could see what magic it held, he threw it into the air. [[2246 旁白 neutral]]
Suddenly, wind and thunder erupted. A crimson light, like a demon's claw, tore through the clear sky. The clouds were shredded into a dark haze that covered the sun. [[2247 旁白 fearful]]
The beautiful scene was instantly destroyed. The wind flattened the grass, and thunder boomed in the sky. [[2248 旁白 fearful]]
The burning runes on the scroll unleashed a destructive power. Kogsag poured all his magic into it without holding back. [[2249 旁白 angry]]
To avoid any more delays or interference from the Water Saintess's strange power, Kogsag skipped the chant and used his ultimate treasure to kill the human saintess as quickly as possible. [[2250 旁白 angry]]
Right now, the Ice Saintess was weak from a long battle, and the Water Saintess was not a fighter. [[2251 旁白 neutral]]
No one could block this 'Great Annihilation' spell. Even the Ice Saintess at full strength would have trouble. [[2252 旁白 fearful]]
It is often said that anyone below the fifth rank is an ant. His 'Great Annihilation' was enough to seriously injure any fifth-rank practitioner, let alone these two incomplete saintesses. [[2253 旁白 neutral]]
The fight was already decided. He had won. [[2254 旁白 neutral]]
Under the terrifying light of 'Great Annihilation', Serenia's dress whipped in the wind. She tightened her grip on her sword, grit her teeth, and prepared to risk everything for a final stand, the sky's destruction reflected in her eyes. [[2255 旁白 fearful]]
But at that critical moment, a soft hand gently patted her shoulder. Serenia turned in confusion and saw Lobelia looking at her with a compassionate, watery gaze, gently shaking her head. [[2256 旁白 surprised]]
"Please, let me handle this." [[2257 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
After speaking, she walked past Serenia and stood before her, facing the storm. [[2258 旁白 neutral]]
"You...!" [[2259 瑟蕾妮娅 surprised]]
Serenia cried out and reached to stop her, but then she was shocked to find that the wind had stopped. [[2260 旁白 surprised]]
No, the wind hadn't stopped; it had been blocked. [[2261 旁白 surprised]]
Lobelia faced 'Great Annihilation' alone, her expression calm. She opened her arms, crossed them over her chest, and in that moment, an incredible power surged within her. A green radiance spread out like an umbrella, blocking the wind, rain, and destructive pressure. [[2262 旁白 surprised]]
Is this Lobelia's power? [[2263 旁白 surprised]]
No, it wasn't just her power. Within the green light, there was a clear resonance. Feeling it, Serenia turned to look at the towering Ancient Tree of Life behind them. [[2264 旁白 surprised]]
Though it had appeared in an instant, its trunk, thicker than a dozen of her could encircle, carried the weight of ages. Dozens of equally thick branches grew from the main trunk, splitting into countless smaller twigs, each covered in lush, green leaves. [[2265 旁白 neutral]]
The entire ancient tree trembled with the resonance, and as its green leaves swayed, they released a rich, vibrant life force. [[2266 旁白 neutral]]
What a magnificent life form. But this tree... why does it look so much like the sacred tree of the elves described in books? [[2267 旁白 surprised]]
Is it my imagination? [[2268 旁白 neutral]]
In a daze, a piece of knowledge popped into her head. [[2269 旁白 neutral]]
Among the six creator gods, they not only left their bloodlines but also created their own kin. And among the kin of the Water God were the elves. [[2270 旁白 neutral]]
