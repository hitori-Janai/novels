Chapter 50: The Great Living Transformation [[2883 旁白 neutral]]
Sorry, Little George. [[2884 旁白 neutral]]
This is a necessary sacrifice so that your favorite Sister Evelyn isn't attacked at night by that perverted nun. [[2885 旁白 neutral]]
On the way back to his room, Andre silently apologized in his heart. [[2886 旁白 neutral]]
He really didn't dare to disbelieve Isabella's verbal threat. [[2887 旁白 neutral]]
Especially one Sunday, when he had changed into Lobelia's appearance, Isabella made a joke at noon, saying she must find out where Lobelia lived. When he left that night, he keenly sensed a graceful figure following him. [[2888 旁白 fearful]]
Although this fellow usually seemed lazy and unreliable, sometimes she surprisingly kept her word, and this personality also gave Andre a particular headache. [[2889 旁白 neutral]]
Tomorrow is Sunday, so tonight he must transform into Lobelia to make some necessary preparations for tomorrow's work. If Isabella were to sneak in for a night attack right now, the trouble would be huge. [[2890 旁白 fearful]]
As for the information she gave, he could believe some of it. After all, the true identity of their church's grand nun was extraordinary, and he was just too lazy to dig into other people's secrets... [[2891 旁白 neutral]]
The information could be believed, but not entirely. The Saintess's forces might inspect Kempfer Town, but the Saintess herself would never come. [[2892 旁白 neutral]]
Please, a Saintess holds a crucial position in a behemoth like the Church. Even if she were to inspect a territory, it would have to be a large cathedral in a big city like Roland City. For a remote place like Kempfer, even if the Saintess herself was willing to condescend, the Church would not allow it. [[2893 旁白 neutral]]
After all, this concerns the Church's reputation. However, the news is definitely not groundless. Most likely, an inspection team led by the Saintess's personal guard will come to Kempfer Town. [[2894 旁白 neutral]]
As long as the Saintess herself doesn't come, with a little care, most troubles can be avoided. [[2895 旁白 neutral]]
Returning to his room, Andre closed the door. He first took off his white priestly robes, opened a drawer, and took out four blessed gems and a white candle. He skillfully placed the gems in the four corners of the room, and the candle stood in the center of the table. [[2896 旁白 neutral]]
After drawing the curtains and making sure the room was completely sealed, Andre raised his index finger, and a small wisp of flame ignited the white candle without a visible fire source. [[2897 旁白 neutral]]
"Mother of Rushing Waters, please draw the curtain, weave a silent shroud with foam as warp and weft." [[2898 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre crossed his hands, held them to his chest, closed his eyes tightly, and recited the prayer spell in a serious and devout voice. [[2899 旁白 neutral]]
As the ritual began and the spell was chanted, circular water patterns appeared at Andre's feet, and a thin mist rose in the air. [[2900 旁白 neutral]]
"The Thousand-Faced Mirror Sea appears as a reflection of the present world; wherever you gaze, it is but a shell of illusion." [[2901 旁白 neutral]]
The mist in the room condensed into liquid water mirrors, and the ethereal mirrors reflected all internal energy fluctuations. [[2902 旁白 neutral]]
"From this moment, this small space is the coffin where the divine sleeps; outside cannot peer in, and inside cannot touch outside." [[2903 旁白 neutral]]
When the last spell was uttered, the mirrors surrounding the room shattered into a spiritual water film, completely isolating all energy fluctuations within the ritual area. [[2904 旁白 neutral]]
The blessed gems in the four corners of the room seemed to be lit by some mysterious power, and the white candle flame on the table, at some point, changed from its normal orange-red to a蔚蓝色, a color completely opposite to the fire attribute. [[2905 旁白 neutral]]
After making ample preparations, Andre breathed a sigh of relief. Every Saturday night, he had to go through this. Compared to the closed rituals for other deities, his set was already the simplest and clearest. [[2906 旁白 neutral]]
After all, in the form of the Water Saintess, he used the knowledge passed down in the Saintess's bloodline to self-optimize and simplify it. Ordinary people would never dare to modify a mysterious ritual, but as the Water Saintess modifying the Water God's ritual, that was extremely authoritative. [[2907 旁白 neutral]]
"Alright, next it's time for a change." [[2908 安德烈 neutral]]
Andre breathed a sigh of relief. He looked at the neatly folded black and white nun's habit that he had prepared beforehand on the bed, and his expression suddenly became somewhat complicated. [[2909 旁白 neutral]]
Ever since he awakened the Saintess bloodline, his life seemed to have been divided into two: one part was the sinner named Selen An, now disguised as Father Andre, and the other part was the Saintess named Lobelia, who, for the sake of living, had to appear as Sister Evelyn every Sunday. [[2910 旁白 neutral]]
Every week, there was this segment of great living transformation, all to guard his little unspeakable secret. [[2911 旁白 neutral]]
However, thinking back to his current life, what did he have to complain about? A sinner could receive so much kindness from so many people; this sacrifice was simply insignificant. [[2912 旁白 neutral]]
Andre took off the white gloves he was wearing, closed his eyes, and pressed his palms together. [[2913 旁白 neutral]]
In the room, the previously dry air suddenly became humid. The azure tide of water seemed to weave a divine robe. As the robe covered the man's body, a sacred glow instantly filled every corner of the room. [[2914 旁白 neutral]]
The divine blood accumulated in his body boiled, strong muscles dissolved and smoothed under this powerful force, skin as white as snow was born from the holy light, azure hair cascaded like a waterfall, and quietly opened serene water-drop eyes were like the boundless sea, embracing all things. [[2915 旁白 neutral]]
After all the energy subsided, Lobelia surveyed the chaotic room filled with masculine vigor, her beautiful willow-like eyebrows involuntarily furrowing slightly. [[2916 旁白 neutral]]
Although water can embrace all things, with her personality, she truly couldn't stand this messy room for even a second. [[2917 旁白 neutral]]
Fortunately, this wasn't the first time she had faced this situation. Every time she transformed, she had to face this "sloppy" room. In fact, Andre's living habits were already above average for adult males, but the tidiness of a male's room was inherently lacking, plus Lobelia had some obsessive-compulsive tendencies... [[2918 旁白 neutral]]
Yes, Sister Evelyn, who was extremely tolerant of others, was, in private, an obsessive-compulsive patient who was extremely strict with herself. [[2919 旁白 neutral]]
"How did I manage to live in such a chaotic environment?" [[2920 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
Lobelia gently pressed her forehead with one hand and sighed leisurely. [[2921 旁白 neutral]]
Complaining aside, the serious Lobelia got to work. She first took out a headscarf from the neatly folded nun's habit, skillfully wrapped her long hair, and then took off her complicated attire, changing into casual clothes for cleaning. [[2922 旁白 neutral]]
The big clean-up began. [[2923 旁白 neutral]]
Unlike ordinary people's cleaning, which requires a series of tools and washing, Lobelia, as the Water Saintess, was very good at using her special abilities. She lightly tapped the air with her fingertip, and a sparrow shaped from pure water came into being. [[2924 旁白 neutral]]
"This time, I'll also rely on you." [[2925 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The water sparrow stood on the girl's hooked index finger, chirping excitedly. After receiving the command, it flapped its wings, and its round body immediately flew towards the dust-covered curtains. [[2926 旁白 neutral]]
"And everyone, I entrust you with purifying the dust here." [[2927 洛蓓莉娅 neutral]]
The water octopus spraying water on the desktop, the water crab spraying foam on the ground, and the water Hakimi flying on eaves and walls all responded to the girl's request and joined the big cleaning activity. [[2928 旁白 neutral]]
Soon, the room returned to being clean and tidy. Lobelia carefully placed the last two demon-hunting bullets in the drawer exactly in the center, and only after confirming from all angles that there was no deviation did the girl's tightly furrowed brows slightly relax. [[2929 旁白 neutral]]
After completing the arrangement task, all the water spirit creations obediently lined up on the ground. Lobelia lowered her head to look at these cute little creatures, covering her mouth with a light laugh. [[2930 旁白 neutral]]
"Thank you all for your hard work, you may disband." [[2931 洛蓓莉娅 happy]]
As her voice fell, the lively water spirit creations all transformed into pure water, returning to the girl's palm. [[2932 旁白 neutral]]
After doing all this, seeing that the sky outside the window had completely darkened, Lobelia put the clean nun's habit on the bed into the laundry basket and picked it up to go to the bathroom. [[2933 旁白 neutral]]
Night had just fallen, and her task had just begun. [[2934 旁白 neutral]]
