Chapter 23: Reset 23 - Confrontation [[1356 旁白 neutral]]
Mara, flying with her wings spread wide, was like a falcon diving low. Her demon-strengthened body tore a path through the weakening blizzard, and her sharp claws made a piercing sound in the wind. [[1357 旁白 fearful]]
Selen An, pulling Anna along in a desperate run, sensed danger behind him. His mind went blank, but his body instinctively dove forward, causing Anna and the baby she held to fall with him into the snow. [[1358 旁白 fearful]]
The moment his body hit the freezing snow, he felt a foul wind brush past his back. The edge of his thin clothes was torn open in three places, and the cold wind rushed in, making Selen An’s teeth chatter. [[1359 旁白 fearful]]
Lying face down in the snow, the young man quickly lifted his head and saw the figure of a deep-purple succubus who had dropped from the sky to block his path. [[1360 旁白 fearful]]
In the blizzard, their eyes met. Mara folded her flesh wings, which were almost numb from movement, but the twisted, evil smile on her face didn't stiffen in the extreme cold. [[1361 旁白 fearful]]
"Master, what are you afraid of? I'm your governess. When you see me, you should trust me." [[1362 玛拉 neutral]]
In the snowstorm, Mara's purple-green demon eyes openly showed her evil desires. Her bare feet left footprints in the snow as she slowly moved closer. [[1363 旁白 fearful]]
Pieces of torn cloth hung from her sharp nails, and her mocking expression was terrifying. [[1364 旁白 fearful]]
Selen An struggled to get up from the snow. His survival instinct made him want to run, but after taking only half a step back, he bumped into the girl's soft body and the newborn baby in her arms. [[1365 旁白 fearful]]
Perhaps because it was bumped, or because it lost the familiar scent of its holder, the swaddled baby finally began to cry loudly. Selen An stopped his retreat. [[1366 旁白 sad]]
Should I really run? [[1367 塞伦安 fearful]]
If it comes to running, Anna, a girl holding a baby, definitely can't run faster than me. But aren't I the one who brought all this trouble? [[1368 塞伦安 sad]]
My arrival attracted these demon predators, putting the already unfortunate sister and brother in danger. And besides, I am the original cause of their misfortune... [[1369 塞伦安 sad]]
Should I run? Follow my cowardly instinct? But even if I run, I'll be caught. Normal humans can't defeat demons. How can someone on two legs outrun someone with wings? [[1370 塞伦安 fearful]]
The fear deep in his bones reached its peak and twisted into a different extreme. Though his body was still shaking, Selen An didn't retreat another step. He desperately tried to steady his breath and stood protectively in front of the sister and brother. [[1371 旁白 fearful]]
Maybe running is a living creature's instinct, but standing in front of this girl who was harmed because of him was also an instinct. [[1372 旁白 neutral]]
Is it because of guilt? [[1373 塞伦安 neutral]]
Perhaps there's some, but not entirely. He never felt he was the real Selen An—that greedy, cowardly, and useless villain from the game who had no good qualities. [[1374 旁白 neutral]]
Although he wasn't some great hero before he transmigrated, the socialist education he grew up with taught him that it's okay to be afraid of death, but sometimes, some things are far more important than death. [[1375 旁白 neutral]]
Anna, holding the swaddled baby, stared blankly at the determined but not-so-tall figure standing before her. [[1376 旁白 surprised]]
"Mr. Andre..." [[1377 安娜 surprised]]
She murmured, stunned. [[1378 旁白 neutral]]
"Don't call me Andre. You must have recognized me long ago, right?" [[1379 塞伦安 sad]]
The young man's voice trembled noticeably, and his breath turned into white mist in the cold air. [[1380 旁白 neutral]]
"I..." [[1381 安娜 sad]]
"After my blood successfully saved your mother, you accidentally called out my name. And the look on your face when we first saw each other after I woke up... I don't think I was mistaken." [[1382 塞伦安 sad]]
Selen An wasn't stupid. When it came to feelings and emotions, he was more sensitive than most people. After hearing that mysterious voice, this ability seemed to have become even sharper and more refined. [[1383 旁白 neutral]]
He didn't know if he had been influenced or changed by that voice, but right now, he truly wanted to "protect" the two lives behind him. [[1384 旁白 neutral]]
Whether it was for personal heroism or for atonement... [[1385 旁白 neutral]]
"I'm sorry. I caused you to lose your father. That was my mistake. But you saved me without holding a grudge, and I'm very grateful. This whole situation is because of me..." [[1386 塞伦安 sad]]
"A life for a life, it's a simple truth. Miss Anna, whether you accept it or not, this is the only thing I can do for you." [[1387 塞伦安 sad]]
"Go!" [[1388 塞伦安 angry]]
He ordered in a low, trembling voice. [[1389 旁白 fearful]]
Anna looked with complicated feelings at this young man, who was completely different from her memory. She once hated this noble, who used his power to kill her father out of lust for her, forcing her and her mother to flee. The hardships and pain she endured over the years only deepened her hatred for Selen An. [[1390 旁白 sad]]
Until that day she was out looking for food and found this unconscious person by the road, who looked almost like a corpse. Although his face was covered in mud, she could still recognize his fine features and the tattered but once-luxurious clothes. She would recognize him even if he were ashes. [[1391 旁白 neutral]]
That was her enemy, her father's killer. Seeing him, she should have killed the villain herself, or just ignored him and let him die. But when she made up her mind, her wood knife just couldn't pierce his chest. She forced herself to turn away from that area, but then she inexplicably walked back... [[1392 旁白 sad]]
She didn't know why she saved this man who deserved to be cut into a thousand pieces. Maybe it was the pity she felt for a dying creature, or maybe the kindness in her heart wouldn't let her kill someone on the verge of death. [[1393 旁白 sad]]
She would not forget her hatred, and if she had the chance, she would get her revenge. But not when a person's life was in danger. [[1394 旁白 neutral]]
She saved him and brought him home with complex feelings. She hid a knife in her sleeve while talking to the awakened young man, trying to find the familiar, disgusting aura she remembered from him. [[1395 旁白 fearful]]
But until now, she hadn't found it. In her and her mother's eyes, he was humble, he was modest, he was polite. He seemed just like his alias, Andre, a brave and upright gentleman. Even knowing his identity was fake, Anna couldn't find a single trace of the spoiled villain in him. [[1396 旁白 surprised]]
He had changed. Maybe he changed during the time she was away, or maybe he changed after a near-death experience. It was undeniable that he had become someone she couldn't hate—especially after he saved her mother with his blood. [[1397 旁白 surprised]]
From that moment on, the desire for revenge might still be there, but it was not as strong as before. She began to see this transformed master with a complex gaze, and only now did she truly understand... [[1398 旁白 neutral]]
Selen An might really be different now. [[1399 旁白 neutral]]
"Take care." [[1400 安娜 sad]]
She held her swaddled brother tighter, clenched her jaw as if making a hard decision, and hurried past the young man's side, disappearing into the white blizzard. [[1401 旁白 sad]]
Mara, now less than ten meters away, didn't stop the fleeing sister and brother. Instead, she looked playfully at the young man facing her directly. [[1402 旁白 neutral]]
"Your change is really surprising, Master." [[1403 玛拉 surprised]]
She said with a smile. [[1404 玛拉 neutral]]
"A noble master whose mind was only filled with sex, money, and greed can actually make a decision to sacrifice himself at the moment of life and death. You truly both surprise and delight me..." [[1405 玛拉 surprised]]
"But it doesn't matter. Whether you have truly changed for the better or have other plans, your life ends here. Next, I will help you shed this human shell and welcome your new life as a demon!" [[1406 玛拉 angry]]
