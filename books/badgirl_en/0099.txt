    "Next, you will drink the blood I bestow upon you. This will be the initial fulfillment of all our agreements." [[5612 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Vlad, seated in his high position, looked down at Seraphina, who was dressed in a maid's outfit and filled with humiliation. His noble, blood-red vertical pupils were full of self-satisfaction. [[5613 旁白 neutral]]
    "...I know that the blood of a high-ranking blood kin is very precious, but I don't need the power of a blood kin. Please withdraw your gift." [[5614 塞拉菲娜 neutral]]
    Seraphina didn't know how she convinced herself. This act, which was no different from betrayal, was once more humiliating and unacceptable than death in her eyes. But recalling her momentary daze just now, she endured it. [[5615 旁白 neutral]]
    When the girl opened her eyes again, the blood-red pupils no longer held their usual stubbornness, but rather a greater degree of the true meekness of a maid. [[5616 旁白 neutral]]
    "Oh, what an unfeeling refusal~" [[5617 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "Very well, as a noble, we should respect a lady's wishes." [[5618 弗拉德 neutral]]
    The elegant blood kin seemed to show a look of regret. [[5619 旁白 neutral]]
    Seraphina felt relieved seeing this. Although the other party was a demon, high-ranking blood kin were famously elegant. At least, this Blood Kin Grand Duke seemed to possess the gentlemanly demeanor a male noble should have on the surface. [[5620 旁白 neutral]]
    But this thought only existed in her mind for less than three seconds. Her relaxed mind instantly went blank with a roar. [[5621 旁白 fearful]]
    All her bones felt crushed in that instant, and it was almost true. The blood kin girl struggled to open her eyes, and the intense feeling of suffocation made her vision blur. [[5622 旁白 fearful]]
    The elegant Blood Kin Grand Duke, with an extremely graceful posture, gripped her neck, and with a wicked smile, used one hand to nail her tightly to the wall. Her body, due to the sudden violent impact, had all its bones shattered, hanging limply on the wall like a cotton doll. [[5623 旁白 fearful]]
    If not for the blood kin's immortal trait, an ordinary person would have already died from that blow. Even with immortality, the pain she was suffering at this moment was enough to prevent her from even screaming. [[5624 旁白 fearful]]
    Vlad extended his free hand, gloved in white, and delicately stroked the girl's blood-stained, pretty face. [[5625 旁白 neutral]]
    "What a beautiful face, but unfortunately, you are just a lowly female slave. Only your little mistress, my future Duchess, is worthy of being called a respected lady." [[5626 弗拉德 angry]]
    That handsome and demonic face, if placed in the Imperial circle, might only need a seductive glance to capture the hearts of countless noble girls. But at this moment, Seraphina felt no male charm from that handsome and demonic face. All she felt was deep dread and bone-chilling coldness. [[5627 旁白 fearful]]
    High-ranking blood kin are indeed very elegant, but no one can say how big the difference is between this elegance and being a psychopath. After all, pathological elegance is still a form of elegance. [[5628 旁白 neutral]]
    Vlad released the hand that was gripping Seraphina, then disgustedly took off his white glove, and looked down at the girl with shattered bones writhing on the ground. [[5629 旁白 neutral]]
    A faint crackling sound came from the air; it was the sound of bones gradually healing under the influence of the blood kin bloodline. As her flesh and bones healed, Seraphina finally had the strength to scream. [[5630 旁白 fearful]]
    "Aghhhhhh..." [[5631 塞拉菲娜 fearful]]
    Listening to the girl's wails, the elegant Blood Kin Grand Duke showed a look of intoxication. [[5632 旁白 neutral]]
    "What a wonderful sound! If dozens of different girls, with different voices, screamed at the same time, it would probably create the most elegant and beautiful symphony in the world." [[5633 弗拉德 happy]]
    After speaking, he restrained his smile again and looked down at the blood kin girl still struggling in pain on the ground, scoffing dismissively. [[5634 旁白 neutral]]
    "Don't play any little tricks in front of me. I have lived for countless years. Childish tricks like feigned surrender are nothing but clumsy performances in front of me..." [[5635 弗拉德 angry]]
    "I am willing to give you the First Embrace of my noble blood. That is out of respect for your master. I am willing to bestow it upon you, and you should prostrate yourself on the ground, thanking me profusely, instead of giving such a foolish and disappointing refusal as before." [[5636 弗拉德 angry]]
    Vlad squatted down, looking down at her blood-stained pretty face with the gaze and tone he would use for a pet. [[5637 旁白 neutral]]
    "Remember, what I choose to bestow upon you, you, a lowly female slave, should accept. You have no right to refuse your master's grace!" [[5638 弗拉德 angry]]
    "...Yes, yes." [[5639 塞拉菲娜 fearful]]
    Her muffled answer, stained with blood, seemed to contain a hint of a sob. [[5640 旁白 sad]]
    "Very good. Now, with a heart full of gratitude and reverence, you shall welcome the most important moment of your life, Avril. I will give you a new life and a new name. Drink this drop of blood, and from now on, you will cut ties with everything from your past." [[5641 弗拉德 neutral]]
    "Whether it's your identity, name, contract, or vows from your human period, all of these are null and void in the face of the great First Embrace I bestow upon you. From now on, you only need to remember one thing: your name is Avril, and you are a female slave under me, Duke Vlad." [[5642 弗拉德 neutral]]
    There was no need to pierce his fingertip with a sharp object, because Vlad, a high-ranking blood kin, controlled the blood within his body to seep out a tiny drop from his skin, hovering at his fingertip, about to fall. [[5643 旁白 neutral]]
    The fragrant scent of high-ranking blood kin blood filled the air. Seraphina felt her body uncontrollably stir. This was the first-tier blood kin's instinctive craving for high-ranking blood, a fundamental logic ingrained in their bones that could not be abandoned. [[5644 旁白 neutral]]
    Staring at the drop of blood her heart yearned for, tears welled up in Seraphina's eyes. [[5645 旁白 sad]]
    As a Holy Nun, she understood very well that being simply assimilated into a blood kin before meant that her body was still under her own control. However, if a first-tier blood kin accepted the First Embrace of a high-ranking blood kin, then... [[5646 旁白 neutral]]
    "Drink this drop of blood, and from now on, both your body and soul will be entirely mine~" [[5647 弗拉德 neutral]]
    Duke Vlad continued to entice her, or rather, he enjoyed the fragrant and sweet scent emitted by his prey as they struggled with their thoughts. This seemingly optional fate actually had only one path, and that path was the degeneration that, as a pure Holy Nun, she never wanted to face. [[5648 旁白 neutral]]
    Tears streamed down her cheeks, chillingly cold as they landed on the back of her hand. Seraphina trembled, staring blankly at the spreading wetness on her hand. [[5649 旁白 sad]]
    Oh, she had already become a vampire. A vampire's tears have no warmth... [[5650 旁白 sad]]
    She cried, then finally closed her eyes, recalling the scene that flashed through her mind just before her death, and then laughed through her tears. The tears blurred the dirty bloodstains on her face, revealing the blood kin's pale skin, as if washing away some precious things she once held. [[5651 旁白 sad]]
    She surrendered, like an obedient female dog, extending her tongue to lick and swallow the sweet yet incredibly bitter blood from Vlad's fingertip. [[5652 旁白 neutral]]
    "Avril... I obey my master's command." [[5653 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    In the fusion of blood and tears, Avril for the first time uttered this name and title that would bring her immense shame and pain throughout her life. [[5654 旁白 sad]]
    After speaking, she curled up her body again, beginning to struggle silently in the endless heat and pain. [[5655 旁白 fearful]]
    "For blood kin, the First Embrace is a painful and grand rebirth, no different from a mother giving birth. Avril, your First Embrace has just begun. I look forward to seeing your new appearance later." [[5656 弗拉德 happy]]
    Vlad smiled expectantly, closed the door, leaving the young girl to groan in pain alone in the enclosed room. [[5657 旁白 neutral]]
    ...... [[5658 旁白 neutral]]
    ...... [[5659 旁白 neutral]]
    The blood-stained memory abruptly ended here. After the First Embrace, her life was completely overturned, entering an abyss from which she could never return. [[5660 旁白 sad]]
    The scene refocused on the dark cellar. The blood kin's eyes allowed them to see in the darkness as if it were daylight. Avril clearly saw the utter mockery on Isabella's face. [[5661 旁白 neutral]]
    A faint hint of bitterness appeared in her eyes, but she quickly covered it with indifference. [[5662 旁白 neutral]]
    "Isabella, if you've calmed down, please reconsider what I just said..." [[5663 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "In this world, the last people I would harm are you and the Young Lady." [[5664 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "Embracing eternal life is a grace many people would strive their entire lives to obtain." [[5665 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    Avril was not lying. During the brief time she was a female slave by Duke Vlad's side, she had seen all sorts of people through her blood kin eyes. For eternal life, they squandered their family fortunes, abandoned human ethics, killed their wives and daughters, and committed other heinous acts. [[5666 旁白 neutral]]
    Becoming a blood kin was, in some ways, indeed a highly sought-after "gift." [[5667 旁白 neutral]]
    Seeing Isabella still unmoved, Avril seemed to grow a little impatient and added again. [[5668 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "Such a good thing, and you're still hesitating..." [[5669 艾薇儿 angry]]
    Clang! [[5670 旁白 neutral]]
    A solemn clang of weapons rang out, bringing a foul wind that brushed past the blood kin girl's cheek, raising her golden hair. [[5671 旁白 neutral]]
    Avril reached out and touched her cheek, where the wind had just brushed. Dazzling crimson blood was flowing from her fingertips. She turned her head; a silver-glowing cross-shaped spear was stuck in the indentation in the wall behind her. [[5672 旁白 neutral]]
    "Go and fulfill your purpose, you... unforgivable traitor!" [[5673 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
    Hot tears streamed down the gray-haired nun's cheeks. Facing her former sister, she hardened her heart and made the most painful decision. [[5674 旁白 sad]]
    Avril was stunned, and her eyes completely turned cold. [[5675 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "Boring." [[5676 艾薇儿 neutral]]
    "Heh heh, Avril, your former sister seems to have lost her mind from anger. What kind of nonsense is this? I thought she would curse you right to your face. Is this all she's got?" [[5677 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    The Rose Earl, who had been watching, finally sneered. He had been very happy to see two women tearing each other apart, but Isabella's sudden illogical outburst really amused him. [[5678 旁白 neutral]]
    But then again, there were only four people in total. Their own Saintess was captured, a trusted companion betrayed them, and another unnamed priest was kicked to death by the roadside. His body was still lying in the indentation in the wall. His remains would completely rot in this dark corner, along with his abrupt and worthless life. [[5679 旁白 neutral]]
    In such a desperate situation, how calm and correct of a decision could you expect from a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl? [[5680 旁白 neutral]]
    Not peeing her pants from fear was already considered outstanding. [[5681 旁白 neutral]]
    "Since you don't know what's good for you, then I have no obligation to save you, my foolish sister. Rose Earl, she's yours." [[5682 艾薇儿 angry]]
    With that, Avril hugged the unconscious green-haired girl in her arms, turned, and her figure distorted and disappeared with the swaying space runes rising from the ground. [[5683 旁白 neutral]]
    Now, in the cellar, only one human and one demon remained. [[5684 旁白 neutral]]
    The Earl looked at the lonely gray-haired girl standing still with pity, and couldn't help but click his tongue. [[5685 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    "Tsk tsk tsk... Look! Little beauty~ In the end, only I am truly devoted to you, so..." [[5686 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    "Why not abandon those worthless beliefs and loyalties, embrace eternal life and eternal youth, and just become my daughter?" [[5687 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    Perverted desires freely spread in this dark, enclosed environment. The human nun, who had lost her weapon, was no different from a lamb waiting to be slaughtered in the Rose Earl's eyes. [[5688 旁白 neutral]]
    What a foolish girl, in a moment of anger and impulse, she even threw away her only life-saving weapon. This was as stupid as a goat personally breaking off its only horn that could threaten a tiger. [[5689 旁白 neutral]]
    Otherwise, even a wounded Fourth-Rank Archmage would still require some effort to deal with, after all, she was a Holy Nun personally appointed and blessed by the Saintess herself. [[5690 旁白 neutral]]
    From when he had been secretly peeking from the blood pool, he had seen that although this gray-haired nun, who pleased him greatly, walked the path of a mage, she cultivated the path of a close-combat nun. [[5691 旁白 neutral]]
    "These days, those who wield blades and guns are fools. Good daughter, obediently accept my First Embrace, and I will personally teach you how to use more profound powers later~" [[5692 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    The Rose Earl approached lewdly, without restraint. [[5693 旁白 neutral]]
    Someone felt offended by that remark... [[5694 旁白 neutral]]
    The scent of decaying roses was getting closer and closer, and the retreating nun's back had already reached the stone wall, with nowhere left to retreat. [[5695 旁白 neutral]]
    "Don't hide, little beauty. Don't be afraid, the process of the First Embrace will be very comfortable. I am always gentle with ladies. Once you taste that feeling, you will even beg me..." [[5696 蔷薇伯爵 neutral]]
    "Slap!" [[5697 旁白 neutral]]
    Earl Wei's lewd words strangely quieted down with an extremely loud slap. [[5698 旁白 neutral]]
    The Rose Earl touched his slapped half-face with disbelief. [[5699 旁白 surprised]]
    No, how dare she? [[5700 蔷薇伯爵 surprised]]
    There were many question marks in his perplexed blood-red eyes. As a noble Blood Kin Earl, he simply couldn't understand how this human girl, who didn't even have a weapon, dared to do this? [[5701 蔷薇伯爵 surprised]]
    "You foolish vampire, still trying to defile the body of a Holy Nun! Drink my blood? Go eat shit!" [[5702 伊莎贝拉 angry]]
    Leaning against the wall, Isabella, with a pale face devoid of blood, used the utmost scorn she had ever felt to mock this immortal monster in front of her. [[5703 旁白 angry]]
    "Boom!" [[5704 旁白 neutral]]
    Even though Isabella responded in time, wrapping her whole body with wind magic to defend as much as possible, her body was still directly embedded into the wall by the Rose Earl's furious blow. [[5705 旁白 fearful]]
    "Pfft!" [[5706 旁白 fearful]]
    The girl's pale complexion became even paler, and blood flowed from the corner of her mouth, adding a touch of tragic beauty to her current posture. [[5707 旁白 sad]]
    "Duke Vlad was right. For lowly human females like you, one shouldn't show any kindness. I even wanted you to be my daughter. Now, I have to teach you a good lesson so you understand how to be a qualified female slave!" [[5708 蔷薇伯爵 angry]]
    Blood-colored magic condensed into a black spear in his hand. This was a common tactic demons used against human mages. When this black spear pierced a human mage's body, it would block the flow of magic within them and cause them unbearable pain. [[5709 旁白 neutral]]
    Isabella had no resistance left after this blow, and the enraged Rose Earl had no intention of showing any pity or tenderness in his eyes. He wanted to pierce this wretched woman's limbs with the black spear in his hand to vent his anger. [[5710 旁白 angry]]
    But just as the black spear was about to pierce Isabella's forearm, at the last moment, a strange yet familiar female voice arrived precisely. [[5711 旁白 neutral]]
    "No fighting." [[5712 陌生女1 neutral]]
